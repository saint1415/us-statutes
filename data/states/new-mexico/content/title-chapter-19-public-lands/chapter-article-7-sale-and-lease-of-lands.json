If more than one such application to lease be filed as herein provided, one of which shall be that of the holder of the existing lease, the commissioner shall lease such land to the bona fide applicant offering the highest annual rental therefor, if to anyone; except that the commissioner, before so doing, if another bona fide applicant shall offer a higher rental than that offered by the holder of the existing lease, shall give written notice to the holder of the existing lease, immediately after September 1st next preceding the expiration of such lease, of the name and address of the applicant offering the highest annual rental and the amount of such offer, and if the holder of the existing lease, on or before September 30th next ensuing, shall meet such offer and has, in good faith, complied with all the requirements of his existing lease, the lease shall be awarded to him, if to anyone.\n\nHistory:Laws 1937, ch. 42, § 2; 1941 Comp., § 8-846; 1953 Comp., § 7-8-51.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material was inserted by the compiler and is not part of the law.\n\nCross references.— For preference in leasing to departments of state for purpose of erecting state buildings,see19-7-27 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor preference to occupants of lands acquired by state, and to persons domiciled or paying taxes therein,see19-7-53 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor lease preference rights of municipality, county or school district,see19-7-56 NMSA 1978.\n\nCondemnation of leased lands.— Defendant lessees, in a condemnation suit by the federal government, holding grazing leases of state-owned tracts, have compensable interests therein, for which they should receive, upon distribution of the proceedings, the condemnation award for the lands they have leased from the state; furthermore, the leases of the state-owned tracts executed or renewed by the state after July 1, 1970, created in the lessee a property compensable in these proceedings.United States v. 41,098.98 Acres of Land, 548 F.2d 911 (10th Cir. 1977).\n\nIn a condemnation suit brought by the United States against state grazing lease held by appellees for a five-year term as provided in the New Mexico Enabling Act, and issued under statutory authority, with a preference right for renewal under this section, which for all practical purposes was an absolute right as against other applicants, the court approved a compensation formula including both the state-owned lands leased by the defendants as well as the fee lands of the defendants as one ownership unit.United States v. 41,098.98 Acres of Land, 548 F.2d 911 (10th Cir. 1977).\n\nEffect of renewal on mortgage.— As between mortgagor and mortgagee, a renewal of a grazing lease was to be regarded as merely a continuation of the original lease, and the operation of this principle was not defeated by the fact that the lease assigned contained no covenant of renewal.Scharbauer v. Graham, 1933-NMSC-043, 37 N.M. 449, 24 P.2d 288 (case decided under former law).\n\nEffect of expiration during cancellation suit.— Mere fact that lease expired prior to decision in the district court did not render moot the question presented by a contest seeking cancellation of the lease by reason of a sublease in violation of its terms, because of the preference right of the holder of the old lease to a new lease.Lusk v. First Nat'l Bank, 1942-NMSC-056, 46 N.M. 445, 130 P.2d 1032.\n\nRight of renewal.— Preference right of renewal under former law referred to all leases issued by the public lands commissioner, including leases of five years and less which the commissioner could make without advertisement and sale at public auction; in case of conflicting rights, the preference was to the one holding the superior right in the judgment of the commissioner.State ex rel. McElroy v. Vesely, 1935-NMSC-096, 40 N.M. 19, 52 P.2d 1090 (decided under prior law).\n\nPart of lease.— Former C.S. 1929, § 132-120, giving preference right of renewal, was a part of a state land lease.State ex rel. McElroy v. Vesely, 1935-NMSC-096, 40 N.M. 19, 52 P.2d 1090 (decided under prior law).\n\nBut not absolute.— Although former C.S. 1929, § 132-120 gave to good-faith lessee of state lands preferred right to renew lease, it was not the intent of the legislature to give an absolute right of renewal, which would run counter to the Enabling Act.State ex rel. McElroy v. Vesely, 1935-NMSC-096, 40 N.M. 19, 52 P.2d 1090, explained inEllison v. Ellison, 1944-NMSC-012, 48 N.M. 80, 146 P.2d 173 (decided under prior law).\n\nWaiver of preference.— Decedent's right to renewal of lease of state lands passed to administrator, who waived such right when he refused to accept renewal, knowing that lease assignment had been fraudulently obtained from decedent's heir; also, such refusal cut off the right of decedent's heirs to claim lease, either through preference or as beneficiaries under lease.Hart v. Walker, 1935-NMSC-089, 40 N.M. 1, 52 P.2d 123.\n\nMandamus not available.— Under former law, the lessee's right of renewal did not justify mandamus against the public lands commissioner, which right had to originate in the constitution or statutes; the Enabling Act, § 10, did not give the lessee absolute right.State ex rel. McElroy v. Vesely, 1935-NMSC-096, 40 N.M. 19, 52 P.2d 1090.\n\nNotice.— Those who may wish to apply and bid for a lease on lands covered by an expiring lease are deprived of \"notice\" in the case of a consolidation of leases by relinquishment and reissuance. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-67.\n\nThe \"notice\" which is given is simply contained in the records of the land office showing that a five-year lease has been granted and, in the normal course, will expire under its terms at the end of that time. 1969 Op.

Const., art. IV, § 32, or art. XIII, § 2, as there is no obligation or liability of the purchaser owed to the state. Although the state agrees to sell the land, the purchaser does not expressly agree to buy it, but rather, he agrees to make the payments promptly and to pay the taxes; the only remedy expressly reserved by the state for default is cancellation at option of commissioner, with retention of all payments of principal and interest, as liquidated damages.Vesely v. Ranch Realty Co., 1934-NMSC-067, 38 N.M. 480, 35 P.2d 297.\n\nNotice for benefit of lessee.— Inasmuch as the 30 days' notice of cancellation of contract is for the benefit of the party whose rights the commissioner proposes to terminate, the succeeding commissioner cannot object to the lack of notice.Vesely v. Ranch Realty Co., 1934-NMSC-067, 38 N.M. 480, 35 P.2d 297.\n\nShow cause notice inadequate.— Notice to show cause why a lease should not be canceled was a notice of contest and not notice of forfeiture required by this section.Commissioner of Pub. Lands v. Van Bruggen, 1947-NMSC-009, 51 N.M. 108, 179 P.2d 528.\n\nAn offending lessee is entitled to a notice of a claimed violation of the terms of the lease, so he may meet the demand to cease within 30 days in which case no cause exists for cancellation, and where his only warning was an order to show cause why his lease should not be canceled, the notice was inadequate to permit cancellation.Commissioner of Pub. Lands v. Van Bruggen, 1947-NMSC-009, 51 N.M. 108, 179 P.2d 528.\n\nOptions of commissioner upon default.— Where lessee had defaulted on payment of notes, commissioner had option to look to lessee and endorsers for payment, and to the security of the lien on improvements, or cancel the lease. Commissioner may insert acceleration clause in lease.Raynolds v. Hinkle, 1933-NMSC-060, 37 N.M. 493, 24 P.2d 738.\n\nGrounds for transfer to creditor.— A creditor of a lessee of state lands demanding transfer to him of the rights of such lessee in default of payment of rentals must show that lessee's default has become fixed as provided in this section.American Mortg. Co. v. White, 1930-NMSC-030, 34 N.M. 602, 287 P. 702, distinguished inArrow Gas Co. v. Lewis, 1962-NMSC-145, 71 N.M. 232, 377 P.2d 655.\n\nCollateral security.— It is not a violation of law to assign a grazing lease obtained from the state land commissioner, as collateral security, so as to render the lease subject to cancellation.Lusk v. First Nat'l Bank, 1942-NMSC-056, 46 N.M. 445, 130 P.2d 1032.\n\nGrounds for cancellation.— Where grazing lease does not have clause providing for cancellation upon notice, except for violation of the conditions, covenants and terms of the lease or nonpayment of rental when due, the commissioner is without authority to cancel. 1944 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 44-4539.",

Att'y Gen. No. 68-122.\n\nReservation through sale notice.— The authority of the commissioner of public lands to grant a right-of-way easement can be exercised through a reservation in the notice of public auction. 1968 Op.

Money erroneously paid on account of a lease or sale of state lands, which money is not carried in a suspense fund but has been distributed to the proper income or permanent fund, shall be repaid in the manner prescribed in this section.\n\nC. If the money erroneously paid was for royalty due under a lease, then, subject to a subsequent audit by the commissioner of public lands or the commissioner's agent, the lessee may either request a refund or may recoup the money by deducting an equivalent amount from subsequent royalty payments due for the same lease and any other lease with the same trust beneficiary; provided that if the amount erroneously paid pursuant to this subsection is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for a lease, no deduction from subsequent payments shall be made without the prior approval of the commissioner of public lands; and, provided further that, no initial claim for recoupment shall be made after six years from the date on which the initial royalty obligation became due.\n\nD. If the amount of money erroneously paid is less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), then, after a claim for a refund has been filed pursuant to Section 19-7-60 NMSA 1978 and approved by the commissioner of public lands, no court action shall be necessary and a refund shall be made under Section 19-7-62 or 19-7-63 NMSA 1978.\n\nE.

Vesely, 1937-NMSC-073, 41 N.M. 543, 72 P.2d 7.\n\nAllegation and proof.— \"Erroneous\" payment must be alleged and proved to authorize a recovery under this section.Staplin v. Vesely, 1937-NMSC-073, 41 N.M. 543, 72 P.2d 7.\n\nActual payment to commissioner required.— Since the claimant had not actually paid money to the commissioner, it did not have a valid claim for refund because a payment attributed to the commissioner's benefit does not meet the requirements of this act. The act is clear in requiring that an overpayment must be erroneously made to the commissioner or to funds administered by the commissioner. In addition, the plain meaning of \"refunds\" from a governmental entity is \"money received by the government or its officers which, for any cause, are to be refunded or restored to the parties paying them.\"Anadarko Petroleum Corp. v.

Walker v. Hinkle, 1933-NMSC-032, 37 N.M. 444, 24 P.2d 286.\n\nLease cancellation appealable.— Lessee whose lease was canceled for subleasing without consent of commissioner of public lands was entitled to appeal to district court.Commissioner of Pub. Lands v. Van Bruggen, 1947-NMSC-009, 51 N.M. 108, 179 P.2d 528.\n\nAppeal of contract cancellation by trespasser.— A railroad, which was not a party to a case before state land commissioner initiated by an order to show cause why a contract to purchase realty on which such railroad as a trespasser had made improvements should not be canceled, was not in position to urge a judgment in the supreme court directing cancellation of the contract, but could appeal to district court.Application of Dasburg, 1941-NMSC-024, 45 N.M. 184, 113 P.2d 569.\n\nMandamus unavailable.— This section provides an adequate remedy at law for anyone who is aggrieved by the action of the commissioner of public lands and, therefore, mandamus does not lie to compel the duties alleged to be due.Andrews v.
