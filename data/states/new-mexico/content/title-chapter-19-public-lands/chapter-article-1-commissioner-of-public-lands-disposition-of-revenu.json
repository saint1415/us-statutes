Yates Co. v. Powell, 98 F.3d 1222 (10th Cir. 1996).\n\nThe commissioner exceeded his authority and usurped a legislative function in promulgating the definition of \"proceeds\" in a rule so that it would require state lessees to pay royalties even when gas was not extracted from the leased premises.Harvey E. Yates Co. v. Powell, 98 F.3d 1222 (10th Cir. 1996).\n\nExtent of commissioner's jurisdiction.— The New Mexico legislature intended the jurisdiction of the commissioner of public lands to extend only so far as those lands acquired by the state pursuant to acts of congress. 1980 Op.

No. 89-30.\n\nRestrictions on trust appropriations were limited to bill's fiscal period.— Restrictions on the appropriation of the miner's hospital trust fund revenues contained in the 1988 appropriations bill were consistent with the rule that legislative conditions on appropriations be limited to the fiscal period covered by the bill. 1989 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 89-30.",
