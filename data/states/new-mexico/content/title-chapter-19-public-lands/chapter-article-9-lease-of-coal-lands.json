Any credit later taken for advance royalties against actual production royalties due shall not exceed fifty percent of the total royalty due and the lease shall not be extended for more than ten years by payment of advance royalties;\n\nE. provide for a royalty of twelve and one-half percent of the proceeds received from the sale of all surface-mined coal or, at the option of the commissioner, the market value of the surface-mined coal and eight percent of the proceeds received from the sale of all underground-mined coal or, at the option of the commissioner, the market value of the underground-mined coal. The royalty rate may be reduced by the commissioner upon a showing that the leases for the nonstate lands in the same logical mining unit provide for a lower rate or that the leased lands will be bypassed and not mined without a rate reduction;\n\nF. provide for an annual rental rate of five dollars ($5.00) per acre of the leased lands, to be paid throughout the effective period of the lease;\n\nG. provide that, except for small incidental quantities which may be vented or flared to achieve access to the coal, any coalbed methane gas is excluded and reserved from the coal lease. A coal lessee may engage in in situ coal gasification provided that such gasification does not disturb or diminish commercial quantities of coalbed methane gas; and\n\nH. contain other provisions prescribed by regulation of the commissioner.\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 200, § 2.",
