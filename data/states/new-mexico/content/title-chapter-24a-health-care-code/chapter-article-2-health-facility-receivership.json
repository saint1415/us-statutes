If, in the exercise of the receiver's powers pursuant to this section, the receiver is in possession of real estate, real or personal property or other goods or services subject to a lease, mortgage, secured transaction, contract or other agreement subject to being voided by the receiver pursuant to Paragraph (4) of Subsection A of this section, and such real estate, real or personal property or other goods or services are necessary for the continued operation of the health facility during the receivership, the receiver may, in lieu or [of] seeking to void such lease, mortgage, secured transaction, contract or other agreement, apply to the court to set a reasonable price, rate or rate of interest to be paid by the receiver under such lease, mortgage, secured transaction, contract or other agreement during the duration of the receivership.
