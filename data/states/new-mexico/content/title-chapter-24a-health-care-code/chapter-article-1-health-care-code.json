If immediate action is required to protect human health and safety, the secretary may suspend a license or impose an intermediate sanction pending a hearing, provided the hearing is held within five working days of the suspension or imposition of the sanction, unless waived by the licensee, and, except for child care centers and facilities, may proceed ex parte pursuant to the Health Facility Receivership Act.\n\nI.
