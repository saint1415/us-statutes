State ex rel. CYFD, 2014-NMCA-057,rev'd by2016-NMSC-016.\n\nGenerally.— An \"employee,\" who leaves a position to enter the armed forces of the United States, may remain in the service indefinitely and retain his reemployment rights. No distinction is made between volunteers and draftees under the Veterans' Reemployment Act (Sections 28-15-1 to 28-15-3 NMSA 1978). No distinction is drawn between officers and enlisted personnel under the Veterans' Reemployment Act. 1959 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 59-18.\n\nScope of benefits.— Volunteers as well as draftees are entitled to the benefits of this act (Sections 28-15-1 to 28-15-3 NMSA 1978). 1942 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 42-4104.\n\nLegislative intent.— The legislative policy indicated by this act (Sections 28-15-1 to 28-15-3 NMSA 1978) is to restore the veteran to his old position whenever possible, and if not, to a position of like seniority, status and pay. 1946 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 46-4832.\n\nIntent regarding Personnel Act.— The language of Subsection B makes it clear that the legislature does not intend for returning veterans seeking reemployment with the state to meet the standards of the Personnel Act. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-108.\n\nOfficers of state not affected.— This act (28-15-1 to 28-15-3 NMSA 1978) does not apply to officers of the state of New Mexico or its subdivisions, but only to employees. 1946 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 46-4882.\n\nTime between leaving employment and induction.— An employee who left his employment within a reasonable time before induction without obtaining other employment in the meantime is entitled to reemployment. 1945 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 45-4829.\n\nEffect of return of veteran.— Since contracts are entered into subject to existing statutes, where a teacher is employed to fill a vacancy caused by the absence of a person in the armed forces, his contract is terminated when the veteran returns to his former position. 1945 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 45-4813, 1945 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 45-4818.\n\nSeven-year absence.— A veteran who was employed within the state of New Mexico as a locomotive fireman and locomotive engineer on January 27, 1951, at which time he was called to active service with the United States Air Force, may upon his discharge from military service on January 31, 1958 secure reemployment under Sections 28-15-1 to 28-15-3 NMSA 1978. 1958 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 58-209.\n\nSalary increases.— When a veteran returns to his former position, he is entitled to proportionate salary increases and other benefits, if any, to which other employees who continued in service have become entitled. 1946 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 46-4815, 1946 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 46-4832.\n\nService credit for retirement purposes.— Section 10-11-6A(1) NMSA 1978 must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the federal and state laws on veteran reemployment rights. If the veteran otherwise qualifies for reemployment and applies within 90 days of the termination of his active duty period, he still may acquire service credit for retirement purposes even though the employer does not actually rehire him until after the ninetieth day. 1988 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 88-24.\n\nEmployee more rights than probationer.— If a person contemplated by Subsection B has gained the status of an \"employee\" as that term is defined by Section 10-9-3 NMSA 1978 and the personnel board rules, he will have additional rights under the state personnel board rules that a \"probationer\" would not. 1969 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 69-108.\n\nAm. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references.— 77 Am.
