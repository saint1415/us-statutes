      "text": "Chapter 28, Article 1 NMSA 1978 may be cited as the \"Human Rights Act\".\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 4-33-1, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 196, § 1; 2000, ch. 4, § 1.\n\nCross references.— For commission on status of women,see28-3-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nFor sex discrimination prohibited,seeN.M. Const., art. II, § 18.\n\nFor Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act,see47-8-1 NMSA 1978.\n\nThe 2000 amendment,effective February 15, 2000, substituted \"Chapter 28, Article 1 NMSA 1978\" for \"this act\".\n\nHuman Rights Act protects against discriminatory treatment,not against general claims of employer unfairness.Juneau v. Intel Corp.,2006-NMSC-002, 139 N.M. 12, 127 P.3d 548.\n\nEvidence of discrimination.— In an action based on a claim of racial discrimination, racist statements made by defendant that were not directed at plaintiff and that did not purport to describe her did not constitute direct evidence of racial discrimination.Perry v. Woodward, 199 F.3d 1126 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nPunitive damages in civil rights action.— Where plaintiff sued state hospital in state court alleging that employees of the hospital had retaliated against plaintiff for filing a human rights commission claim; plaintiff did not sue any individual employees in the state court action; plaintiff obtained an award for compensatory damages in state court; and plaintiff sued individual employees of the hospital in federal court for violation of plaintiff's civil rights for retaliating against plaintiff, plaintiff was not barred from suing individual employees for retaliation and recovering punitive damages, because different rules governed the measure of damages in the state action and in the federal action.Gonzales v. Hernandez, 175 F.3d 1202 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nNotice requirement where federal court action.— Failure to give notice to New Mexico human rights commission before bringing action in federal court bars recovery in federal court.Harris v. Ericson, 457 F.2d 765 (10th Cir. 1972).\n\nHuman Rights Act inapplicable on federal enclave.— Congress has exclusive authority over federal enclaves, and therefore plaintiffs' claims were barred by the federal enclave doctrine, where plaintiffs, employees of Sandia corporation (Sandia labs) located on Kirtland air force base, brought state-law employment discrimination claims against Sandia labs, a federally funded research and development contractor operating under contract for the department of energy.Kennicott v. Sandia Corp., 314 F.Supp.3d 1142 (D.N.M. 2018)\n\nJudicial review of discrimination claims.— Court's failure to explicitly apply framework for analyzing employment discrimination suits set forth inMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) and adopted by the New Mexico Supreme Court inSmith v. FDC Corp., 1990-NMSC-020, 109 N.M. 514, 787 P.2d 433, was not error where the court's findings were consistent with a proper application of the McDonnell Douglas/Smith framework and the record contained substantial evidence to support the court's finding that the employer did not perceive the employee to be handicapped.Martinez v. Yellow Freight Sys., 1992-NMSC-015, 113 N.M. 366, 826 P.2d 962.\n\nRetaliatory discharge.— A common-law tort action for retaliatory discharge may be brought when the claimant alleges she was discharged from her employment because she earlier sought relief against her employer under the New Mexico Human Rights Act.Gandy v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1994-NMSC-040, 117 N.M. 441, 872 P.2d 859;EEOC v. MTS Corp., 937 F. Supp. 1503 (D.N.M. 1996).\n\nEmployer's burden of proof in sex discrimination and wrongful discharge cases.— In a sex discrimination case, as with damages recoverable in cases of wrongful discharge, the employer has the burden of proving the employee did not exercise reasonable diligence in mitigating lost earnings. It is for the jury to decide, under the facts of each case, whether seeking formal education represents care or diligence to minimize damages.Montoya v. Super Save Warehouse Foods, 1991-NMSC-003, 111 N.M. 212, 804 P.2d 403.\n\nAvailability of equal protection claim.— The law in New Mexico is unsettled as to whether a claim of discrimination in employment that is asserted under this act can also be maintained under the equal protection clause of the New Mexico constitution.Roybal v. City of Albuquerque, 653 F. Supp. 102 (D.N.M. 1986).\n\nNew Mexico created state remedy for age discriminationthrough the New Mexico Human Rights Act that affords victims back wages and other monetary relief.Gill v. Public Employees Ret. Bd., 2004-NMSC-016, 135 N.M. 472, 90 P.3d 491.\n\nAge and disability claims must be pursued under administrative procedures availablein the New Mexico Human Rights Act and do not lie in common-law tort.Gormley v. Coca-Cola Enter., 2004-NMCA-021, 135 N.M.128, 85 P.3d 252,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-003, 137 N.M. 192, 109 P.3d 280.\n\nEffect on municipalities.— The passage of the 1969 \"Human Rights Act\" does not remove the authority municipalities already possess in the realm of human rights. Whatever ordinance is passed cannot lower or be inconsistent with the state standards that have been set for human rights in this article. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 71-64.\n\nLaw reviews.— For note and comment, \"For This Right There is a Remedy: New Mexico Supreme Court's Application of Ex Parte Young to Allow Suits Against the State in Gill v.

Bd. of Educ., 2023-NMCA-069, cert. granted.\n\nWhere plaintiff, a sixteen-year-old Native American student enrolled in a public high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, filed a complaint alleging a violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 28-1-1 to 28-1-15, against defendants, after plaintiff's English teacher, during an in-classroom Halloween activity, cut several inches of hair from another Native American student and asked that student if she were a \"bloody Indian\" and where defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that public secondary schools are not public accommodations in the administration of their academic programs, the district court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment, because a state-created public school enacting its constitutional mandate to educate school-age children falls within the definition of \"public accommodation\" as intended by the legislature.Johnson v. Bd. of Educ., 2023-NMCA-069, cert. granted.\n\nMeaning of \"places of accommodation\" in former law.— Single dwellings, duplexes and apartment buildings, being in their nature distinctly private, were not \"places of accommodation\" as defined in the Civil Rights Act, 49-8-1 to 49-8-7, 1953 Comp.

2020, ch. 49, § 2; 2023, ch. 29, § 2; 2024, ch. 21, § 5.\n\nThe 2024 amendment,effective May 15, 2024, expanded the list of protected classes to include a person's military status; in Subsection A, after \"serious medical condition,\" added \"or military status\" throughout the section; in Subsection E, after \"occupational qualification\" added \"or military status\"; and in Subsections F and G, after \"physical or mental disability,\" added \"or military status\".\n\nThe 2023 amendment,effective June 16, 2023, extended the scope of the Human Rights Act to apply to certain actions of the State and its political subdivisions and public contractors, expanded the list of protected classes to include gender; substituted \"handicap\" with \"disability\" throughout the section; after \"sexual orientation\", added \"gender\" throughout the section; and added Subsection M.\n\nThe 2020 amendment,effective May 20, 2020, added protections for pregnancy, childbirth or related conditions; in Subsection A, after each occurrence of \"gender identity\", added \"pregnancy, childbirth or condition related to pregnancy or childbirth\"; and added Subsections K and L.\n\nThe 2019 amendment,effective June 14, 2019, included sexual orientation and gender identity among classes protected from unlawful discrimination by employers, and removed the limitation of fifteen or more employees an employer must have to include sexual orientation and gender identity as bases for unlawful discrimination practices; and in Subsection A, added \"sexual orientation, gender identity\", and after \"shall apply to discrimination based on age\", deleted \"or, if the employer has fifteen or more employees, to discriminate against an employee based upon the employee's sexual orientation or gender identity\".\n\nThe 2004 amendment,effective July 1, 2004, amended Subsection A to delete \"sexual orientation, gender identity\" and to add at the end of the Subsection \"or, if the employer has fifty or more employees, spousal affiliation; provided, however, that 29 U.S.C. Section 631(c)(1) and (2) shall apply to discrimination based on age; or, if the employer has fifteen or more employees, to discriminate against an employee based upon the employee's sexual orientation or gender identity;\".\n\nThe 2003 amendment,effective July 1, 2003, deleted \"the\" following \"therewith because of\" in Paragraph G(2); substituted \"55-9-102\" for \"55-9-109\" following \"defined by Section\" in Subsection H; substituted \"a person's\" for \"to an individual's\" following \"fail to accommodate\" in Subsection J; inserted \"sexual orientation, gender identity\" throughout the section; and substituted \"a person\" for \"an individual\", \"person\" for \"individual\", and \"a person's\" for \"an individual's\" throughout the section.\n\nThe 2001 amendment,effective June 15, 2001, in Subsection A, inserted \"or other statutory prohibition\" following \"bona fide occupational qualification\", deleted \"marital status\" preceding \"physical or mental handicap\", and inserted \"or, if the employer has fifty or more employees, spousal affiliation\" following \"serious medical condition\"; in Subsections B through H, substituted \"spousal affiliation\" for \"marital status\"; and in Subsection E, inserted \"or serious medical condition\" following the first instance of \"mental handicap\".\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, inserted \"serious\" preceding \"medical condition\" throughout the section.\n\nI. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\n\"Otherwise qualified\".— An employee is required to demonstrate that he or she is \"otherwise qualified\" to show a public policy violation based on Section 28-1-7A NMSA 1978.Chavez v. Qwest, Inc., 483 F.Supp.2d 1103 (D.N.M. 2007).\n\nERISA actions.— Where a complaint asserts a mixed motive of both discrimination because of age and discrimination because of a benefits-defeating motive, ERISA does not completely preempt a state age-discrimination claim.Ruby v. Sandia, 699 F.Supp.2d 1247 (D.N.M. 2010).\n\nHuman Rights Act inapplicable on federal enclave.— Congress has exclusive authority over federal enclaves, and therefore plaintiffs' claims were barred by the federal enclave doctrine, where plaintiffs, employees of Sandia corporation (Sandia labs) located on Kirtland air force base, brought state-law employment discrimination claims against Sandia labs, a federally funded research and development contractor operating under contract for the department of energy.Kennicott v. Sandia Corp., 314 F.Supp.3d 1142 (D.N.M. 2018).\n\nTribal Nations are not subject to the New Mexico Human Rights Act.— Where plaintiff filed claims for sexual harassment and retaliation pursuant to the New Mexico Human Rights Act (NMHRA), 28-1-1 to 28-1-14 NMSA 1978, against the Sandia Pueblo police chief and the Sandia Pueblo police captain, in their individual capacities, and where defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's claims, arguing that the infringement test precluded state court jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims, that the NMHRA did not apply because Tribal Nations are not employers under the NMHRA, and that the claims were untimely, and where the district court granted defendants' motion, finding that the NMHRA did not provide plaintiff a cause of action, the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiff's claims, because an unlawful discriminatory act pursuant to 28-1-7(A) NMSA 1978 requires the action of an employer, and Tribal Nations are not \"employers\" as defined by the NMHRA.South v. Lujan, 2024-NMCA-049, cert. denied.\n\nAge and sex discrimination claims not preempted by federal law.— Where plaintiff claimed that defendant Sandia national laboratories discriminated against her by forcing her from her position as a neutron generator productions specialist and placing her in a new job as a maintenance support technician, where she was unlikely to succeed because of her age and sex, and that after defendant placed her in this new position, defendant determined that plaintiff was not physically capable of doing the job, advised her to apply for other positions within the organization and eventually terminated her, and where defendant claimed that the wrongs of which plaintiff complains arose from a breach of obligations under a collective bargaining agreement governed by the federal Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), dismissal of plaintiff's claims was not proper, because the LMRA does not preempt plaintiff's age and sex discrimination claims and New Mexico employees have the right not to suffer discrimination on the basis of age or sex independent of a collective bargaining agreement's language about an employee's rights.Benavidez v. Sandia National Laboratories, 212 F.Supp.3d 1039 (D.N.M. 2016).\n\nFederal enclave doctrine barred plaintiff's plausible age and sex discrimination claims.— Where plaintiff claimed that defendant Sandia national laboratories discriminated against her by forcing her from her position as a neutron generator productions specialist and placing her in a new job as a maintenance support technician, where she was unlikely to succeed because of her age and sex, and that after defendant placed her in this new position, defendant determined that plaintiff was not physically capable of doing the job, advised her to apply for other positions within the organization and eventually terminated her, although plaintiff pled sufficient facts to make it plausible that she had a protected status under the NMHRA, being over the age of forty and a woman, that defendant took an adverse employment action against her, and that her protected status was a determinative factor in the decision for her reassignment, significant change in employment status, or change in benefits, her claims, brought under the New Mexico Human Rights Act, §§ 28-1-1 to -14 NMSA 1978, were barred by the federal enclave doctrine because the events complained of took place on Kirtland air force base and congress has exclusive authority over federal enclaves.Benavidez v. Sandia National Laboratories, 212 F.Supp.3d 1039 (D.N.M. 2016).\n\nConstitutionality of section.— This section defines what is an unlawful discriminatory practice with sufficient particularity to effectuate the legislative intent of the Human Rights Act, and therefore is not repugnant to the New Mexico constitution.Keller v. City of Albuquerque, 1973-NMSC-048, 85 N.M. 134, 509 P.2d 1329,overruled on other grounds,Green v. Kase, 1992-NMSC-004, 113 N.M. 76, 823 P.2d 318.\n\nBurden of proving exhaustion of administrative remedies.— Plaintiffs, who have alleged in their complaint that they have exhausted their administrative remedies, have the burden of proving exhaustion of their administrative remedies in order for their case to proceed at the district court level.Rist v. Design Ctr. at Floor Concepts, 2013-NMCA-109.\n\nFailure to exhaust administrative remedies deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.— Where plaintiffs alleged that they were dismissed from their jobs for not participating in defendant's religious activities; plaintiffs filed complaints with the equal employment opportunity commission and cross filed the complaints with the human rights division; plaintiffs did not receive a letter of non-determination from the division; and after receiving right-to-sue letters from the commission, plaintiffs filed suit against defendant for wrongful termination and discrimination, plaintiffs failed to exhaust their remedies under the Human Rights Act, which deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction, requiring the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice.Rist v. Design Ctr. at Floor Concepts, 2013-NMCA-109.\n\nProhibiting commercial photography business from discriminating based on sexual orientation did not violate freedom of expression.— Where plaintiff offered wedding photography services to the general public; plaintiff's business was a public accommodation under the Human Rights Act, Section 28-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.; plaintiff refused to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony between defendant and defendant's partner on religious grounds; and plaintiff claimed that the act compelled plaintiff to express a positive image and message about same-sex commitment ceremonies contrary to plaintiff's beliefs, the act did not violate plaintiff's first amendment rights to refrain from speaking because the act only requires that businesses that operate as a public accommodation, cannot discriminate against potential clients based on their sexual orientation, it does not compel plaintiff to either speak a government-mandated message or to publish the speech of another person.Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 2013-NMSC-040,aff'g2012-NMCA-086, 284 P.3d 428.\n\nWhere plaintiff violated the Human Rights Act, Section 28-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., by refusing on religious and moral grounds to photograph defendant's commitment ceremony with defendant's same-sex partner; and plaintiff claimed that the act violated plaintiff's freedom of expression because photography is an artistic expression entitled to first amendment protection, the act did not violate plaintiff's freedom of expression because the act regulated plaintiff's conduct in its commercial business, not its speech or right to express its views about same-sex relationships.Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 2012-NMCA-086, 284 P.3d 428, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-008,aff'd, 2013-NMSC-040.\n\nProhibiting commercial photography business from discriminating based on sexual orientation did not violate freedom of religion.— Where plaintiff offered wedding photography services to the general public; plaintiff's business was a public accommodation under the Human Rights Act, Section 28-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.; plaintiff refused to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony between defendant and defendant's partner on religious grounds; and plaintiff claimed that the act compelled plaintiff to express a positive image and message about same-sex commitment ceremonies contrary to plaintiff's beliefs, the act did not violate plaintiff's first amendment free exercise rights because the act is a neutral law of general applicability that ensures that businesses that choose to operate as a public accommodation do not discriminate against protected classes of people, it does not target only religiously motivated discrimination.Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 2013-NMSC-040,aff'g2012-NMCA-086, 284 P.3d 428.\n\nWhere plaintiff violated the Human Rights Act, Section 28-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., by refusing on religious and moral grounds to photograph defendant's commitment ceremony with defendant's same-sex partner; and plaintiff claimed that the act violated plaintiff's freedom of religion because the act forced plaintiff to photograph same-sex marriages in violation of plaintiff's owner's religious belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, the act did not violate plaintiff's freedom of religion because the act is directed at and applies generally to all citizens transacting business through public accommodations that deal with the public at large, any burden on religion or religious beliefs was incidental and uniformly applied to all citizens, and a rational basis existed to support the governmental interest in protecting specific classes of citizens from discrimination in public accommodations.Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 2012-NMCA-086, 284 P.3d 428, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-008,aff'd, 2013-NMSC-040.\n\nBurden of proof.— To avoid an adverse judgment as a matter of law, the plaintiff ordinarily need not introduce additional evidence of discrimination beyond evidence establishing a prima facie case and evidence of the falsity of the proffered reason for the employment action.Garcia-Montoya v. State Treasurer's Office, 2001-NMSC-003, 130 N.M. 25, 16 P.3d 1084.\n\nProtections in Human Rights Act apply equally to all plaintiffs, regardless of minority status.— The New Mexico Human Rights Act (NMHRA) prohibits unlawful discrimination based on the traits declared by the legislature to be worthy of protection. Therefore, under the plain language of the NMHRA, its protections and requirements apply equally to all plaintiffs, regardless of their minority status.Garcia v. Hatch Valley Pub. Schs., 2018-NMSC-020,rev'g2016-NMCA-034, 369 P.3d 1.\n\nPrima facie case of employment discrimination.— To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination, the plaintiff must show that the plaintiff is a member of a protected class, the plaintiff was qualified to continue in the employment position, plaintiff's employment was terminated, and plaintiff was dismissed purportedly for performance nearly identical to the performance of one outside the protected class who was nonetheless retained.Garcia v. Hatch Valley Pub. Schs., 2018-NMSC-020,rev'g2016-NMCA-034, 369 P.3d 1.\n\nWhere plaintiff claimed that she was subjected to employment discrimination because she is not Hispanic, and where plaintiff proffered evidence purporting to show that she was treated less favorably than her Hispanic coworkers in a variety of ways, some of which were unrelated to her performance or termination, such as the scheduling and assignment of bus routes, compensation for pre- and post-trip inspection time, maintaining a clean bus, and enforcement of post-accident testing and suspension policies, plaintiff's proffered evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory termination, and the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment, because plaintiff failed to come forward with evidence that one or more Hispanic employees' performance was nearly identical to plaintiff's performance as a whole; the evidence was therefore insufficient to rule out the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the termination of her employment.Garcia v. Hatch Valley Pub. Schs., 2018-NMSC-020,rev'g2016-NMCA-034, 369 P.3d 1.\n\nBurden of proof on claims of unlawful discrimination.— For claims of unlawful discrimination, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of demonstrating a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that he or she is a member of the protected group, that he or she was qualified to continue in his or her position, that his or her employment was terminated, and that his or her position was filled by someone not a member of the protected class, or that he or she was dismissed purportedly for misconduct nearly identical to that engaged in by one outside of the protected class who was nonetheless retained. A plaintiff is also afforded the opportunity to rebut the employer's proffered reason as pretextual.Garcia v. Hatch Valley Pub. Schs., 2016-NMCA-034, cert. granted.\n\nRebutting presumption of liability.— Where no tangible employment action has been taken against the employee, the employer may rebut the presumption of liability by proving elements of an affirmative defense.Ocana v. Am. Furniture Co., 2004-NMSC-018, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58.\n\nFailure to state claim for common law retaliatory discharge.— Where plaintiffs, who brought a claim for wrongful termination based on religious discrimination, alleged that defendant discriminated against plaintiffs because of plaintiffs' religion, created a hostile work environment for plaintiffs and retaliated against plaintiffs by terminating plaintiffs in violation of the Human Rights Act, specifically Section 28-1-7 (A) NMSA 1978, plaintiffs did not plead a claim for the common law tort of retaliatory discharge nor did they give defendant adequate notice of the common law tort claim separate from the wrongful termination charge filed under the Human Rights Act.Rist v. Design Ctr. at Floor Concepts, 2013-NMCA-109.\n\nPublic secondary schools are public accommodations subject to the New Mexico Human Rights Act.— Albuquerque public schools offer services to the community as a whole such that refusing educational services based on race, religion, or any other protected category would contravene legislative intent under NMSA 1978, § 28-1-7(F), and therefore public secondary schools are public accommodations subject to the New Mexico Human Rights Act.Johnson v. Bd. of Educ., 2023-NMCA-069, cert. granted.\n\nWhere plaintiff, a sixteen-year-old Native American student enrolled in a public high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, filed a complaint alleging a violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 28-1-1 to 28-1-15, against defendants, after plaintiff's English teacher, during an in-classroom Halloween activity, cut several inches of hair from another Native American student and asked that student if she were a \"bloody Indian\" and where defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that public secondary schools are not public accommodations in the administration of their academic programs, the district court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment, because a state-created public school enacting its constitutional mandate to educate school-age children falls within the definition of \"public accommodation\" as intended by the legislature.Johnson v. Bd. of Educ., 2023-NMCA-069, cert. granted.\n\nSummary judgment appropriate.— Because plaintiff had acknowledged that she could not reasonably be accommodated in her former job and reassignment was not required under the Human Rights Act, summary judgment on a Human Rights Act claim was appropriate.Albert v. Smith's Food & Drug Ctrs., Inc., 356 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\nGuidance provided by interpretation of federal law.— The evidentiary methodology adopted by the United States Supreme Court in interpreting the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides guidance for proving a violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act.Smith v. FDC Corp., 1990-NMSC-020, 109 N.M. 514, 787 P.2d 433.\n\nReassignment. — Although the Human Rights Act was intended to eliminate unlawful discriminatory practice, nothing in that broad purpose requires that reasonable accommodation be read to include reassignment.Albert v. Smith's Food & Drug Ctrs., Inc., 356 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\n\"Reasonable accommodation\" defined.— Although the statute does not define what constitutes a \"reasonable accommodation\", the New Mexico Human Rights Commission regulations, 9.1.1.7 NMAC, define reasonable accommodation.Albert v. Smith's Food & Drug Ctrs., Inc., 356 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\nMedical marijuana is not an accommodation that must be provided for by employer.— Where plaintiff filed a complaint with the New Mexico human rights division alleging unlawful discrimination by defendant tractor supply company, and where evidence at trial established that plaintiff applied for a management position with defendant, and where, during the interview process, plaintiff advised defendant's hiring manager of his diagnosis of HIV/AIDS and of his participation in the medical cannabis program, and where, after being hired for the job, defendant was required to report to a testing facility to undergo a drug test, the results of which indicated a positive test for cannabis metabolites, and where defendant discharged plaintiff on the basis of the positive drug test, defendant's motion to dismiss was granted because the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act, §§ 26-2B-1 through § 26-2B-10 NMSA 1978, which authorizes New Mexico's medical cannabis program, combined with the New Mexico Human Rights Act, §§ 28-1-1 through § 28-1-14 NMSA 1978, does not provide a cause of action for plaintiff, as medical marijuana is not an accommodation that must be provided for by the employer.Garcia v. Tractor Supply Company, 154 F.Supp.3d 1225 (D.N.M. 2016).\n\nII. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION.\n\nRefusal by commercial photography business to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony constituted discrimination.— Where plaintiff offered wedding photography services to the general public; plaintiff's business was a public accommodation under the Human Rights Act, Section 28-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.; and plaintiff refused to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony between defendant and defendant's partner on religious grounds, plaintiff violated the act because plaintiff discriminated against defendant on the basis of plaintiff's sexual orientation.Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 2013-NMSC-040,aff'g2012-NMCA-086, 284 P.3d 428.\n\nWhere plaintiff, which was a commercial photography business, refused to photograph defendant's commitment ceremony with defendant's same-sex partner based on plaintiff's owners' religious and moral beliefs which prohibited plaintiff from photographing images that convey a message that marriage can be defined other than as the union of one man and one woman; and plaintiff constituted a public accommodation under the Human Rights Act, Section 28-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., plaintiff violated the act by discriminating against defendant based on defendant's sexual orientation.Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 2012-NMCA-086, 284 P.3d 428, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-008,aff'd, 2013-NMSC-040.\n\nHostile work environment sexual harassment.— A plaintiff's claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment was supported by substantial evidence where she proved the following: an attorney, who worked with plaintiff as a paralegal, regularly made sexual innuendoes and told dirty jokes that were demeaning to women, engaged in sexual discussions and flirted with female employees, inappropriately touched female employees, commented about employees' sexual preferences and tolerated similar conduct by other office employees and the attorney became more aggressive when plaintiff reported the occurrences to her employer, followed plaintiff and yelled at her, disciplined plaintiff for pretextual reasons and berated and belittled her publicly.Littell v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2008-NMCA-012, 143 N.M. 506, 177 P.3d 1080.\n\nEmployer liability will be presumedwhere there is actionable sexual harassment and the harassing employee has supervisory authority over the victimized employee.Ocana v. American Furn. Co., 2004-NMSC-018, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58.\n\nProof of sex discrimination.— In plaintiff's action alleging that her employer discriminated against her on the basis of her sex, the trial court properly allowed her to compare her wages with those of males employed as subsidiary managers by the company in other cities.Sonntag v. Shaw, 2001-NMSC-015, 130 N.M. 238, 22 P.3d 1188.\n\nHostile work environmentclaim was established by aggregation of incidents reflecting severity and pervasiveness of harassment almost daily for nineteen months.Nava v. City of Santa Fe, 2004-NMSC-039, 136 N.M. 647, 103 P.3d 571.\n\nPrima facie case of a hostile work environment claim.— For a hostile work environment claim to survive a summary judgment motion, a plaintiff must show that a rational jury could find that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.DeLopez v. Bernalillo Pub. Schs., 558 F. Supp. 3d 1129 (D. N.M. 2021).\n\nPlaintiff failed to establish a claim for discrimination based on a hostile work environment.— Where plaintiff, an elementary school teacher, brought an action against the Bernalillo public schools and several of its employees, alleging age discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge in violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act, §§ 28-1-1 through 28-1-14 NMSA 1978, following the constructive termination of her employment, summary judgment was granted in defendants' favor on the hostile work environment claim, because plaintiff's allegations that her supervisor targeted her with snide remarks, inappropriate \"faces\" and false accusations, followed by unjustified disciplinary actions, an unfair performance evaluation, and a circulated rumor that plaintiff complained to the public education department, did not objectively amount to a severe, pervasive hostile work environment where plaintiff was disciplined after admitting that she touched two children in separate incidents, one of which caused the student physical harm and the other of which defendants reasonably believed violated state statutes.DeLopez v. Bernalillo Pub. Schs., 558 F. Supp. 3d 1129 (D. N.M. 2021).\n\nStandard applicable to hostile work environment claims.— To state a claim for a hostile work environment, the alleged conduct must be so severe and pervasive that the workplace is transformed into a hostile and abusive environment for the employee.Herald v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of N.M., 2015-NMCA-104, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-009.\n\nWhere plaintiff, a resident physician at the university of New Mexico school of medicine, was dismissed from the residency program and brought suit against the board of regents of the university of New Mexico claiming sex discrimination, and where plaintiff proffered a jury instruction stating that to prove her hostile work environment, she was required to establish that defendant's conduct, after it learned of plaintiff's allegations of rape, was based on her sex and was \"severe or pervasive,\" the district court's denial of plaintiff's instruction was proper, and the court's instruction, stating that to find a hostile work environment, plaintiff had to establish that defendant's conduct was based on plaintiff's sex and was \"severe and pervasive,\" accurately stated the law.Herald v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of N.M., 2015-NMCA-104, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-009.\n\nAdverse employment actions construed.— Adverse employment actions are significant changes in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.Sharpe-Miller v. Walmart, Inc. ___ F.Supp.3d ___ (D. N.M. 2023).\n\nPlaintiff failed to demonstrate that he suffered an adverse employment action in his unlawful discharge claim.— Where plaintiff alleged that defendant violated the New Mexico Human Rights Act when it discriminated against him on the basis of his sexual orientation when it failed to properly investigate his discriminatory complaints, demotion, and termination because of his sexual orientation, defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted because the evidence presented did not support a finding that defendant's demotion was in any way motivated by plaintiff's sexual orientation, but was the result of defendant's failure to follow company protocols and policy regarding managerial responsibilities, and the record did not support a finding that plaintiff was constructively discharged by defendant, but was due to plaintiff's habitual tardiness and absences, which was promptly reversed upon discovering plaintiff's jury duty obligation.Sharpe-Miller v. Walmart, Inc. ___ F.Supp.3d ___ (D. N.M. 2023).\n\nClaim not barred by exclusivity provision of Worker's Compensation Act.— The plaintiff's claim of sex discrimination under the New Mexico Human Rights Act was not barred by the exclusivity provision of the Worker's Compensation Act, Section 52-1-6 NMSA 1978 et seq., even though her claim for worker's compensation and for violation of the NMHRA stemmed from the same set of facts.Sabella v. Manor Care, Inc., 1996-NMSC-014, 121 N.M. 596, 915 P.2d 901.\n\nClaim under the Human Rights Act was not barred by the Personnel Act.— The protections against discrimination and retaliation contained in the Human Rights Act apply to probationary employees of the state who have been discharged pursuant to the Personnel Act, Section 10-9-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.Rodriguez v. N.M. Dep't of Workforce Solutions, 2012-NMCA-059, 278 P.3d 1047.\n\nWhere the employee was hired as a probationary employee of the Department of Workforce Solutions; while the employee was a probationary employee, the employee was given notice of dismissal from the employee's position pursuant to the Personnel Act, Section 10-9-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., which permitted the department to terminate the employee without cause; as a probationary employee, the employee had no property interest in continuing employment; and the employee filed a claim under the Human Rights Act alleging discrimination and retaliation based on sex and age, the employee had a right to pursue the claims under the Human Rights Act.Rodriguez v. N.M. Dep't of Workforce Solutions, 2012-NMCA-059, 278 P.3d 1047.\n\nHuman Rights Act prohibition against discrimination on the basis of spousal affiliation or sexual orientation.— An owner of a mobile home park was not \"using\" property for an immoral purpose when renting to cohabiting couples, or to tenants engaged in drug trafficking in the absence of a showing of knowledge of the drug trafficking.Maloof v. Prieskorn, 2004-NMCA-126, 136 N.M. 516, 101 P.3d 327, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-011, 136 N.M. 656, 103 P.3d 580.\n\nCity of Albuquerque ordinance which prohibits public nuditydoes not violate the New Mexico Human Rights Act which in general prohibits an establishment that offers services to the public from discriminating on the basis of sex.City of Albuquerque v. Sachs, 2004-NMCA-065, 135 N.M. 578, 92 P.3d 24, cert. denied, 2004-NMCERT-006, 135 N.M. 789, 93 P.3d 1292.\n\nSummary judgment appropriate.— Where superior told plaintiff over a two-month period that he found plaintiff attractive and asked if plaintiff was interested in a relationship, but did not pursue the matter after he was rebuffed by plaintiff and reduced his contact with plaintiff; superior never made any comment connecting a promised raise to anything other than plaintiff's job performance; and plaintiff offered no evidence that her work performance was affected, that she felt compelled to resign, that her superior made any suggestion that her response to his advances would have an impact on her compensation or other aspect of her employment, or that plaintiff suffered any adverse employment action after she reported what she believed to be harassment to her superior, plaintiff failed to show quid pro quo sexual harassment, hostile work environment sexual harassment, constructive discharge or retaliation.Ulibarri v. State, 2006-NMSC-009, 139 N.M. 193, 131 P.3d 43.\n\nIII. AGE, DISABILITY AND RACE DISCRIMINATION.\n\nAge and disability claimsmust be pursued under the New Mexico Human Rights Act and do not lie in common law tort. Employees may not pursue age and discrimination claims outside the Act that do not contain allegations sufficient to meet the elements of retaliatory discharge, intentional infliction of emotional distress, prima facie tort, or other existing independent torts.Gormley v. Coca-Coca Enters., 2004-NMCA-021, 135 N.M. 128, 85 P.3d 252,aff'd, 2005-NMSC-003, 137 N.M. 192, 109 P.3d 280.\n\nDisability based on serious medical condition.— Plaintiff established a prima facie case of disability for purposes of an employment discrimination claim based on plaintiff's breast cancer and on the effects of plaintiff's cancer medication which substantially impaired plaintiff's normal sex life.Keller v. Board of Educ. of City of Albuquerque, 182 F. Supp. 2d 1148 (D.N.M. 2001).\n\nHuman Rights Act prohibitsemployers from refusing to reasonably accommodate individual's disability.Albert v. Smith's Food & Drug Centers, Inc., 356 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\nNew Mexico created state remedy for age discriminationthrough the New Mexico Human Rights Act that affords victims back wages and other monetary relief.Gill v. Pub. Employees Ret. Bd., 2004-NMSC-016, 135 N.M. 472, 90 P.3d 491.\n\nBona fide occupational qualification.— Termination of nanny who, due to illness, was unable to perform job was not a wrongful discharge under this section; the ability to attend work regularly is a bona fide occupational qualification within the meaning of Subsection A.Stock v. Grantham, 1998-NMCA-081, 125 N.M. 564, 964 P.2d 125, cert. denied, 125 N.M. 322, 961 P.2d 167.\n\nRace discrimination not shown.— Shopping center manager did not discriminate against an East Indian store owner by refusing to renew the owner's lease of a space in the shopping center, where the decision not to renew the lease was purely a business judgment based on efforts to improve the center's \"tenant mix\".Goradia v. Hahn Co., 1991-NMSC-040, 111 N.M. 779, 810 P.2d 798.\n\nProtections in Human Rights Act apply equally to all plaintiffs, regardless of minority status.— The New Mexico Human Rights Act (NMHRA) prohibits unlawful discrimination based on the traits declared by the legislature to be worthy of protection. Therefore, under the plain language of the NMHRA, its protections and requirements apply equally to all plaintiffs, regardless of their minority status.Garcia v. Hatch Valley Pub. Schs., 2018-NMSC-020,rev'g2016-NMCA-034, 369 P.3d 1.\n\nPrima facie case of employment discrimination.— To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination, the plaintiff must show that the plaintiff is a member of a protected class, the plaintiff was qualified to continue in the employment position, plaintiff's employment was terminated, and plaintiff was dismissed purportedly for performance nearly identical to the performance of one outside the protected class who was nonetheless retained.Garcia v. Hatch Valley Pub. Schs., 2018-NMSC-020,rev'g2016-NMCA-034, 369 P.3d 1.\n\nWhere plaintiff claimed that she was subjected to employment discrimination because she is not Hispanic, and where plaintiff proffered evidence purporting to show that she was treated less favorably than her Hispanic coworkers in a variety of ways, some of which were unrelated to her performance or termination, such as the scheduling and assignment of bus routes, compensation for pre- and post-trip inspection time, maintaining a clean bus, and enforcement of post-accident testing and suspension policies, plaintiff's proffered evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory termination, and the district court did not err in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment, because plaintiff failed to come forward with evidence that one or more Hispanic employees' performance was nearly identical to plaintiff's performance as a whole; the evidence was therefore insufficient to rule out the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the termination of her employment.Garcia v. Hatch Valley Pub. Schs., 2018-NMSC-020,rev'g2016-NMCA-034, 369 P.3d 1.\n\nClassifications such as Caucasian, white, and non-Hispanic are protected.— Where plaintiff, a Caucasian and of German descent, claimed that she was subject to discrimination based on her status as a non-Hispanic, the district court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the school district that refused to renew plaintiff's employment contract was not aware of plaintiff's asserted national origin, and therefore plaintiff's national origin could not, as a matter of law, have been a motivating factor in the decision to terminate her employment. A national origin discrimination claim based on the ethnic distinction between Hispanics and non-Hispanics is actionable under the New Mexico Human Rights Act.Garcia v. Hatch Valley Pub. Schs., 2016-NMCA-034, cert. granted.\n\nReverse discrimination claims.— Reverse discrimination claims are analyzed like any other racial discrimination claim, and where plaintiff, who identified her protected group as white or non-Hispanic, presented evidence concerning her training and experience, as well as evidence that other school bus drivers, who did not belong to the protected class, had similar performance issues and were not terminated, plaintiff satisfied the prima facie case requirement to show that the circumstances of her termination give rise to an inference of discrimination, and the burden shifts to the school district to provide a legitimate purpose for plaintiff's termination. Plaintiff's evidence was also sufficient to raise a question as to pretext, and therefore plaintiff put forward sufficient evidence to create genuine issues of material fact with respect to her discrimination claim against defendant. The district court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claim.Garcia v. Hatch Valley Pub. Schs., 2016-NMCA-034, cert. granted.\n\nAge and race discrimination shown.— Fifty-nine year-old Navajo Indian made out a case that he was terminated because of his age and race, where he identified age and race-based animus, and demonstrated that he was treated differently than similarly situated young, non-Native Americans, to a degree sufficient to support a judgment and award of damages.Smith v. FDC Corp., 1990-NMSC-020, 109 N.M. 514, 787 P.2d 433.\n\nAge discrimination not shown.— Employee's charge of age discrimination was not established where the evidence showed that the employer did not breach its reduction-in-force policy, plaintiff was not treated less favorably than younger employees, and the employer had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason not to retain the employee.Cates v. Regents of N.M. Inst. of Mining & Tech., 1998-NMSC-002, 124 N.M. 633, 954 P.2d 65.\n\nPrima face case for age discrimination.— To establish a prima facie case for age discrimination, the plaintiff must prove that she was within the protected class of individuals 40 or older, was performing satisfactory work, terminated from employment, and replaced by a younger person.DeLopez v. Bernalillo Pub. Schs., 558 F. Supp. 3d 1129 (D. N.M. 2021).\n\nPlaintiff failed to establish a prima face case of age discrimination.— Where plaintiff, an elementary school teacher, brought an action against the Bernalillo public schools and several of its employees, alleging age discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge in violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act, §§ 28-1-1 through 28-1-14 NMSA 1978, following the constructive termination of her employment, summary judgment was granted in defendants' favor on the age discrimination claim, because plaintiff submitted no direct evidence of age discrimination, and defendants had a non-discriminatory reason for not renewing plaintiff's contract and constructively terminating her employment, based on stipulated evidence that plaintiff touched two children in separate incidents, one of which caused the student physical harm and the other of which defendants reasonably believed violated state statutes.DeLopez v. Bernalillo Pub. Schs., 558 F. Supp. 3d 1129 (D. N.M. 2021).\n\n\"Medical condition\" does not include a temporary injury with minimal residual effects.Trujillo v. N. Rio Arriba Elec. Coop., Inc., 2002-NMSC-004, 131 N.M. 607, 41 P.3d 333.\n\nCourt may not impute knowledge of certain medical conditions.— Where the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, the employer cannot be held to have imputed knowledge of a medical condition.Trujillo v. N. Rio Arriba Elec. Coop., 2002-NMSC-004, 131 N.M. 607, 41 P.3d 333.\n\nTotally disabled employee.— By admitting in his worker's compensation claim that he was totally disabled, an employee also admitted that he was not \"otherwise qualified\", per Subsection A, and, thus, was barred as matter of law from recovery under the Human Rights Act, Section 28-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.Kitchell v. Pub. Serv. Co., 1998-NMSC-051, 126 N.M. 525, 972 P.2d 344.\n\nIV. RETALIATION.\n\nRetaliation provisions.— The plain language of the New Mexico Human Rights Act retaliation provision in Section 28-1-7I(2) NMSA 1978 is broad enough to provide protection to a defense attorney participating in a mediation.Kelley v. City of Albuquerque, 542 F.3d 802 (10th Cir. 2008)\n\nActs of retaliation.— Prohibited acts of \"threats, reprisal or discrimination\" are considered together under the general label of unlawful retaliation.Juneau v. Intel Corp., 2006-NMSC-002, 139 N.M. 12, 127 P.3d 548.\n\nPrima facie case of retaliation.— To present a prima facie case of retaliation, opposition to a discriminatory practice must be shown and regardless of how a complaint of discrimination is made to the employer, the employee's communication to the employer must sufficiently convey the employee's reasonable concerns that the employer has acted or is acting in an unlawful discriminatory manner and at the very least, if the statement does not mention a specific act of discrimination, the employer must be able to discern from the context of the statement that the employee opposes an allegedly unlawful employment practice.Ocana v. American Furniture Co., 2004-NMSC-018, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58.\n\nTo make a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show he or she engaged in protected opposition to discrimination, he or she subsequently suffered adverse action by the employer, and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.DeLopez v. Bernalillo Pub. Schs., 558 F. Supp. 3d 1129 (D. N.M. 2021).\n\nPlaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.— Where plaintiff, an elementary school teacher, brought an action against the Bernalillo public schools and several of its employees, alleging age discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge in violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act (NMHRA), §§ 28-1-1 through 28-1-14 NMSA 1978, following the constructive termination of her employment, summary judgment was granted in defendants' favor on the retaliation claim, because although plaintiff engaged in protected activity, filing a grievance with the school board, she did not allege in the grievance that any unprofessional behavior or bias against her was because of her age, or any other protected category under the NMHRA.DeLopez v. Bernalillo Pub. Schs., 558 F. Supp. 3d 1129 (D. N.M. 2021).\n\nWhere former employee who worked as a veterinary medical officer and area epidemiology officer for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) brought an action asserting retaliation claims under the New Mexico Human Rights Act (NMHRA), §§ 28-1-1 to 28-1-14 NMSA 1978, against employees of the New Mexico Livestock Board (NMLB), claiming that the NMLB employees wrote negative comments about plaintiff's job performance in correspondence to his USDA supervisor, resulting in plaintiff's termination from the USDA, in retaliation for plaintiff's opposition to a discriminatory practice when he disclosed that the USDA and the NMLB allowed an infection agent to enter the human food chain on the Navajo reservation and that a USDA employee committed fiscal fraud, the district court did not err in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment, because plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the NMHRA because he provided no evidence that defendant had any knowledge of plaintiff's protected activities.Muller v. Perdue, 744 Fed. Appx. 555 (10th Cir. 2018).\n\nBurden of proof.— In action for retaliation under the New Mexico Human Rights Act, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant's actions were taken with the intent to retaliate against the plaintiff.Gioia v. Pinkerton's, Inc., 194 F. Supp. 2d 1207 (D.N.M. 2002).\n\nPlaintiff who is not at-will employee may not pursue actionfor tort of retaliatory discharge under the policy exception to the at-will doctrine when the plaintiff has an alternative remedial grievance procedure available under a collective bargaining agreement.Silva v. American Fed'n. of State, County & Mun. Employees, 231 F.3d 691 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\nContinuing violation doctrine applies to retaliation claim.— The continuing violation doctrine applies to retaliation claims. If one act contributing to a retaliation claim based on a series of actions and not a single, discrete act occurred within the statutory period for filing complaints, all acts creating the retaliation claim may be considered, including facts and evidence of facts that occurred prior to the one-hundred-eighty-day statute of limitations cut-off for filing complaints.Charles v. NMSU Regents, 2011-NMCA-057, 150 N.M. 17, 256 P.3d 29, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nWhere plaintiff complained several times about the conduct of a co-worker and after each complaint, the co-worker and plaintiff's supervisors retaliated with harassment, threatening behavior, discrimination and reprisals, plaintiff's claim of retaliation was based on a cumulative series of acts, not a discrete discriminatory act, the continuing violation doctrine applied, and the court could consider all of the conduct that occurred during plaintiff's employment, including conduct that occurred more than 180 days prior to the date plaintiff filed a complaint.Charles v. NMSU Regents, 2011-NMCA-057, 150 N.M. 17, 256 P.3d 29, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nSufficient evidence of constructive discharge.— Where plaintiff testified that during plaintiff's four years of employment with defendant, plaintiff's co-worker yelled at plaintiff, told plaintiff to \"shut up\", accused plaintiff of not doing anything, called plaintiff insulting names, subjected plaintiff to intimidating conduct by yelling at plaintiff, slammed drawers and cabinets, refused to give plaintiff receipts for purchases made using a university card that was issued to plaintiff, made fun of plaintiff, and told plaintiff to hold plaintiff's blouse closed when plaintiff bent down or the co-worker would kick plaintiff; some of the co-worker's conduct occurred in front of students; and plaintiff's supervisor yelled at plaintiff and criticized plaintiff in front of students, threw a cigarette butt at plaintiff, unfairly criticized plaintiff's work performance, accused plaintiff of being late to work, and decreased plaintiff's performance rating with respect to working relations, plaintiff's evidence was sufficient to support the jury's findings that plaintiff was constructively discharged.Charles v. NMSU Regents, 2011-NMCA-057, 150 N.M. 17, 256 P.3d 29, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-001, 150 N.M. 558, 263 P.3d 900.\n\nRetaliatory discharge shown.— In an action by an employee against an employer alleging gender discrimination and retaliatory discharge, since the supervisor's own testimony constituted an admission that the employee's complaint of gender discrimination caused him to make the determination to terminate her, the employee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Brillhart v. Philips Elec. N. Am. Corp., 938 F. Supp. 742 (D.N.M. 1996),rev'd, 179 F.3d 1271 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\nRetaliatory actions shown.— Jury reasonably concluded that retaliation was the motive behind the unfair criticism and isolation to which the employee was subjected after she filed a discrimination claim, as well as the employer's failure to give her the same consideration for a particular position as other employees.Gonzales v. N.M. Dep't of Health, 2000-NMSC-029, 129 N.M. 586, 11 P.3d 550.\n\nEvidence established retaliation for opposing unlawful discriminatory practice.— Where plaintiff filed a worker's compensation claim after hurting his ankle while working at the outback steakhouse (outback) in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and where outback terminated plaintiff's employment because it believed that plaintiff could not perform the tasks required of his job, and where a jury found that outback violated the New Mexico Human Rights Act (NMHRA), §§ 28-1-1 through -14 NMSA 1978, and awarded plaintiff damages for lost wages and emotional distress, the district court did not err in denying outback's motion for judgment as a matter of law, because plaintiff established that outback believed, even if mistakenly, that plaintiff was physically handicapped, that his ankle injury substantially limited one or more of his major life activities, and the record established that plaintiff had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that outback violated the NMHRA by terminating him because it regarded him as having a physical handicap.Goodman v. OS Rest. Servs. LLC, 2020-NMCA-019.\n\nProspective employee may be required to enter race on application for security reasonsdespite provisions of Section 59-4-4C, 1953 Comp.

      "text": "A. A person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice and a member of the commission who has reason to believe that discrimination has occurred may file with the human rights division of the labor department a written complaint that shall state the name and address of the person alleged to have engaged in the discriminatory practice, all information relating to the discriminatory practice and any other information that may be required by the commission. All complaints shall be filed with the division within three hundred days after the alleged act was committed.\n\nB. The director shall advise the respondent that a complaint has been filed against the respondent and shall furnish the respondent with a copy of the complaint. The director shall promptly investigate the alleged act. If the director determines that the complaint lacks probable cause, the director shall dismiss the complaint and notify the complainant and respondent of the dismissal. The complaint shall be dismissed subject to appeal as in the case of other orders of the commission.\n\nC. If the director determines that probable cause exists for the complaint, the director shall attempt to achieve a satisfactory adjustment of the complaint through persuasion and conciliation. The director and staff shall neither disclose what has transpired during the attempted conciliation nor divulge information obtained during any hearing before the commission or a commissioner prior to final action relating to the complaint. An officer or employee of the labor department who makes public in any manner information in violation of this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than one year.\n\nD. A person who has filed a complaint with the human rights division may request and shall receive an order of nondetermination from the director without delay after the division's receipt of the complaint and in jointly filed cases, after the federal complaint has been closed. The order of nondetermination may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of Section 28-1-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nE. In the case of a complaint filed by or on behalf of a person who has an urgent medical condition and has notified the director in writing of the test results, the director shall make the determination whether probable cause exists for the complaint and shall attempt any conciliation efforts within ninety days of the filing of the written complaint or notification, whichever occurs last.\n\nF. If conciliation fails or if, in the opinion of the director, informal conference cannot result in conciliation and the complainant has not requested a waiver of right to hearing pursuant to the provisions of Subsection J of this section, the commission shall issue a written complaint in its own name against the respondent, except that in the case of a complaint filed by or on behalf of a person who has an urgent medical condition, who has notified the director in writing of the test results and who so elects, the director shall issue an order of nondetermination, which may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of Section 28-1-13 NMSA 1978. The complaint shall set forth the alleged discriminatory practice, the secretary's regulation or the section of the Human Rights Act alleged to have been violated and the relief requested. The complaint shall require the respondent to answer the allegations of the complaint at a hearing before the commission or hearing officer and shall specify the date, time and place of the hearing. The hearing date shall not be more than fifteen or less than ten days after service of the complaint. The complaint shall be served on the respondent personally or by registered mail, return receipt requested. The hearing shall be held in the county where the respondent is doing business or the alleged discriminatory practice occurred.\n\nG. Within one year of the filing of a complaint by a person aggrieved, the commission or its director shall:\n\n(1) dismiss the complaint for lack of probable cause;\n\n(2) achieve satisfactory adjustment of the complaint as evidenced by order of the commission; or\n\n(3) file a formal complaint on behalf of the commission.\n\nH. Upon the commission's petition, the district court of the county where the respondent is doing business or the alleged discriminatory practice occurred may grant injunctive relief pending hearing by the commission or pending judicial review of an order of the commission so as to preserve the status quo or to ensure that the commission's order as issued will be effective. The commission shall not be required to post a bond.\n\nI. For purposes of this section, \"urgent medical condition\" means any medical condition as defined by an appropriate medical authority through documentation or by direct witness of a clearly visible disablement that poses a serious threat to the life of the person with the medical condition.\n\nJ. The complainant may seek a trial de novo in the district court in lieu of a hearing before the commission, provided the complainant requests from the director, in writing, a waiver of complainant's right to hearing within sixty days of service of written notice of a probable cause determination by the director. The director shall approve the waiver request and shall serve notice of the waiver upon the complainant and respondent. The complainant may request a trial de novo pursuant to Section 28-1-13 NMSA 1978 within ninety days from the date of service of the waiver. Issuance of the notice shall be deemed a final order of the commission for the purpose of appeal pursuant to Section 28-1-13 NMSA 1978.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 4-33-9, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 196, § 9; 1981, ch. 220, § 1; 1983, ch. 241, § 3; 1987, ch. 342, § 21; 1991, ch. 45, § 1; 1993, ch. 268, § 2; 1993, ch. 305, § 1; 1995, ch. 125, § 2; 2005, ch. 311, § 1.\n\nThe 2005 amendment,effective June 17, 2005, changed the time when complaints must be filed from one hundred eighty days to three hundred days in Subsection A; deleted the former provision of Subsection D that the division shall receive an order of non-determination one hundred eighty days after receipt of the complaint; provided in Subsection D that the division shall receive and order of non-determination without delay after receipt of the complaint and in jointly filed cases, after the federal complaint has been closed; and changed the time the complainant may request a trial de novo from thirty days to ninety days.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, made minor stylistic changes in Subsection A, in Subsection F, inserted \"and the complainant has not requested a waiver of right to hearing pursuant to the provisions of Subsection J of this section\" in the first sentence and \"or hearing officer\" in the third sentence, and added Subsection J.\n\nThe 1993 amendment,effective June 18, 1993, inserted a new Subsection G, and redesignated former Subsections G and H as present Subsections H and I.\n\nThe 1991 amendment,effective July 1, 1991, inserted \"human rights\" in the first sentence of Subsection A; added Subsections D, E and H; redesignated former Subsections D and E as Subsections F and G; in Subsection F added the exception at the end of the first sentence; and made stylistic changes in Subsections A and B.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies.— A plaintiff must exhaust plaintiff's administrative remedies against a party before bringing an action against that party based on a claim under the Human Rights Act.Sonntag v. Shaw, 2001-NMSC-015, 130 N.M. 238, 22 P.3d 1188.\n\nIndependent tort action not precluded.— The Human Rights Act did not preclude the plaintiff from bringing a tort claim against her employer and supervisor based on allegations that the supervisor disparaged and humiliated her in front of other employees necessitating her hospitalization.Beavers v. Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., 1995-NMCA-070, 120 N.M. 343, 901 P.2d 761.\n\nCompliance with grievance procedure of Human Rights Act is prerequisite to suitunder the act.Jaramillo v. J.C. Penney Co., 1985-NMCA-002, 102 N.M. 272, 694 P.2d 528.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies not required.— Because the Human Rights Act does not provide an exclusive remedy, exhaustion of administrative remedies under the act is not a prerequisite to proceeding with an independent tort claim. The legislature did not intend the act's remedies to be exclusive.Gandy v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1994-NMSC-040, 117 N.M. 441, 872 P.2d 859.\n\nEffect of filing with EEOC.— Even though the plaintiff had filed a sex discrimination complaint against her former employer only with the equal employment opportunity commission (EEOC), she exhausted her administrative remedies and could file an appeal in the district court because a work-sharing agreement between the EEOC and New Mexico human rights division (NMHRD) and NMHRD regulations provided that NMHRD procedural requirements were met by filing a complaint with either the NMHRD or the EEOC.Sabella v. Manor Care, Inc., 1996-NMSC-014, 121 N.M. 596, 915 P.2d 901.\n\nNotice required.— Plaintiff has to give notice to the New Mexico human rights commission (now the human rights division of the department of labor) of the alleged discrimination before commencement of his action in federal court.Harris v. Ericson, 457 F.2d 765 (10th Cir. 1972).\n\nNotice of right to sue from EEOC.— Receiving a notice of right to sue from the equal employment opportunity commission did not satisfy the state law requirement of obtaining an order from the human rights division, nor did such notice affect the 30-day time limit for filing an appeal from an order of the division in state court.Mitchell-Carr v. McLendon, 1999-NMSC-025, 127 N.M. 282, 980 P.2d 65.\n\nStatute of limitations begins to run from the date of an adverse employment action.— In age discrimination cases, the statute of limitations commences to run when a plaintiff knows or should know of the adverse employment action, regardless of whether the plaintiff then has or should have knowledge of the employer's discriminatory intent.Slusser v. Vantage Builders, Inc., 2013-NMCA-073.\n\nStatute of limitations began to run upon termination of employment.— Where plaintiff, who held a managerial position in defendant's accounting department and who met or exceeded defendant's expectations, was terminated by defendant in February 2006 ostensibly because plaintiff's position had been eliminated by a restructuring of the accounting department; in June 2007, plaintiff learned that a younger person, who was paid substantially less than plaintiff, had been assigned plaintiff's position and had the same roles and performed the same job as plaintiff; plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination in October 2007; and plaintiff claimed that the statute of limitations began to run when plaintiff learned that defendant's action was discriminatory, the statute began to run upon plaintiff's termination and expired prior to the filing of plaintiff's action.Slusser v. Vantage Builders, Inc., 2013-NMCA-073.\n\nStatute of limitations was not equitably tolled.— Where plaintiff asserted that evidence of discrimination existed immediately after plaintiff's termination that a younger employee took over plaintiff's responsibilities; and plaintiff never showed that plaintiff acted diligently to discover the evidence and pursue plaintiff's rights or that plaintiff could not have known about the discrimination even with reasonable diligence in investigating the basis of plaintiff's termination, the statute of limitations was not equitably tolled.Slusser v. Vantage Builders, Inc., 2013-NMCA-073.\n\nEquitable estoppel did not prevent the assertion of statute of limitations.— Where defendant told plaintiff that plaintiff was being terminated because plaintiff's position had been eliminated as a result of a restructuring of defendant's business and plaintiff later learned that plaintiff's termination was performance related, defendant's original statement to plaintiff did not constitute active steps to prevent plaintiff from timely filing an age discrimination complaint and defendant was not equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense.Slusser v. Vantage Builders, Inc., 2013-NMCA-073.\n\nNotice not timely filed.— Failure to file within the time set forth in Subsection A deprives the New Mexico commission of a bona fide opportunity to consider or act upon the discrimination complaint, and plaintiff cannot successfully rely on the resultant rejection as such a termination of state proceedings within the meaning of § 706(d), of Title VII of 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(d), so as to invoke the extended federal filing period.Dubois v. Packard Bell Corp., 470 F.2d 973 (10th Cir. 1972).\n\nTime limit under Subsection G.— Subsection G does not expressly place a jurisdictional time limit on the issuance of orders of nondetermination.Mitchell-Carr v. McLendon, 1999-NMSC-025, 127 N.M. 282, 980 P.2d 65.\n\nEffect of not meeting state notice requirement on federal age discrimination action.— The failure to satisfy the state notice requirement within the time limits specified by state law does not bar a federal action which has already been commenced, but such federal action should be held in abeyance so as to give the state agency the opportunity to entertain respondent's grievance.Mistretta v. Sandia Corp., 639 F.2d 588 (10th Cir. 1980).\n\nCommencement of state proceeding prerequisite to federal age discrimination action.— The commencement of state proceedings, in so-called deferral states such as New Mexico, is a jurisdictional requirement of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act.Mistretta v. Sandia Corp., 639 F.2d 588 (10th Cir. 1980).\n\nWhen statutory period commences to run anew.— The statutory period commences to run anew from the last allegedly unlawful employment practice.Molybdenum Corp. of Am. v. EEOC, 457 F.2d 935 (10th Cir. 1972).\n\nCommencement when no continuing unlawful practice.— The limitation period for filing a complaint commenced to run when second employment application was denied for the same reason as first, and where refusal to hire was not actuated by a continuing discriminatory employment practice.Molybdenum Corp. of Am. v. EEOC, 457 F.2d 935 (10th Cir. 1972).\n\nExhaustion of remedies.— A plaintiff suing as the personal representative of a decedent, rather than on her own behalf, must still exhaust the administrative remedies pursuant to this act against the defendant before she may sue the defendant in court.Tafoya v. Bobroff, 865 F. Supp. 742 (D.N.M. 1994),aff'd, 74 F.3d 1250 (10th Cir. 1996).\n\nComplaint form denied filers the right to exhaust administrative remedies.— Where the charge of discrimination form prescribed by regulation of the human rights division instructed filers to identify the alleged discriminating agency by the name and address of the agency, but did not require any identification of individual agency employees involved in the discrimination, the form did not provide filers a fair and adequate opportunity to exhaust administrative remedies and preserve the right to pursue judicial remedies for liability against individual defendants under the Human Rights Act and filers who filed the prescribed form were not required to have exhausted administrative remedies against the previously unnamed individual defendants before pursuing their judicial remedies against the previously unnamed individual defendants.Lobato v. N.M. Env't Dep't, 2012-NMSC-002, 268 P.3d 1284.\n\nLaw reviews.— For article, \"Age Discrimination in Employment: A Comparison of the Federal and State Laws and Remedies in New Mexico,\" see 7 N.M.

The respondent to a complaint made pursuant to Section 28-1-10 NMSA 1978 may file a written answer to the complaint, appear at the hearing, give testimony and be represented by counsel and may obtain from the commission subpoenas for any person or for the production of any evidence pertinent to the proceeding. The complainant shall be present at the hearing and may be represented by counsel. Each party shall have the right to amend his complaint or answer.\n\nB. A panel of three members of the commission designated by the chairman shall sit, and a decision agreed upon by two members of the panel shall be the decision of the commission. However, no commissioner who has filed a complaint may sit on the panel hearing his complaint. Hearings also may be conducted by a hearing officer employed by the human rights division of the labor department or, if the hearing officer is unavailable, one member of the commission may be designated by the chairman to act as a hearing officer. A hearing officer shall have the same powers and duties as a commissioner as set forth in Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of Section 28-1-4 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. The complainant or his representative shall present to the commission or the hearing officer the case supporting the complaint. No evidence concerning prior attempts at conciliation shall be received. The director shall not participate in the hearing, except as a witness.\n\nD. The commission and the hearing officer shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence governing courts of law or equity but shall permit reasonable direct examination and cross-examination and the submission of briefs. Testimony at the hearing shall be taken under oath and recorded by tape or otherwise. Upon the request of any party, testimony shall be transcribed, provided that all costs of transcribing shall be paid by the party so requesting. Each commissioner and hearing officer may administer oaths.\n\nE. Upon the conclusion of a hearing conducted by a hearing officer, the hearing officer shall prepare a written report setting forth proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommending the action to be taken by the commission. The hearing officer shall submit the report to a review panel consisting of no more than three members of the commission designated by the chairman. No commissioner may sit on the panel reviewing the hearing officer's report issued in connection with a complaint filed by the commissioner. A decision by a majority of the members of the review panel shall be the decision of the commission. If the commission finds from the evidence presented at any hearing held pursuant to this section that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice, it shall make written findings of fact, conclusions of law and its decision based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law. The commission may adopt, modify or reject the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and the action recommended by the hearing officer. Within five days after any order is rendered by the commission following a hearing, the commission shall serve upon each party of record and his attorney, if any, a written copy of the order by certified mail to the party's address of record. All parties shall be deemed to have been served on the tenth day following the mailing. As part of its order, the commission may require the respondent to pay actual damages to the complainant and to pay reasonable attorneys' fees, if the complainant was represented by private counsel, and to take such affirmative action as the commission considers necessary, including a requirement for reports of the manner of compliance.\n\nF. If the commission finds from the evidence that the respondent has not engaged in a discriminatory practice, it shall make written findings of fact and serve the complainant and respondent with a copy of the findings of fact and with an order dismissing the complaint.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 4-33-10, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 196, § 10; 1975, ch. 248, § 1; 1983, ch. 241, § 4; 1987, ch. 342, § 22; 1995, ch. 125, § 3.\n\nThe 1995 amendment,effective June 16, 1995, substituted \"must\" for \"shall\" in Subsection A; added the third and fourth sentences in Subsection B; in Subsection C, substituted \"The complainant or his representative\" for \"A member of the division staff, the attorney general or special counsel\" and inserted \"or the hearing officer\"; in Subsection D, inserted \"and the hearing officer\" in the first and last sentences; and in Subsection E, added the first through the fourth and the sixth sentences, inserted \"presented at any hearing held pursuant to this section\" in the fifth sentence, and made a minor stylistic change in the last sentence.\n\nProceeding not stayed by filing federal suit.— The filing of an age discrimination complaint in federal court does not stay a proceeding before the commission to redress the same alleged unlawful discriminatory practice.Mares v. Santa Fe Pub. Schs., 1987-NMSC-074, 106 N.M. 354, 743 P.2d 110.\n\n\"Actual damages\".— The law in New Mexico is unsettled as to whether the provision for \"actual damages,\" Subsection E, encompasses damages for emotional harm.Roybal v.

A person aggrieved by an order of the commission may obtain a trial de novo by filing a notice of appeal in the district court of the county where the discriminatory practice occurred or where the respondent does business.

Pursuant to 12-1-8 NMSA 1978, Laws 2005, ch. 311, § 2, as the last act signed by the governor, is set out above and incorporates both amendments.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION.\n\nCollateral estoppel did not apply.— The findings made in administrative proceedings are not entitled to collateral estoppel in New Mexico Human Rights Act actions because by specifically providing for a \"trial de novo in district court\" in New Mexico Human Rights Act actions, the legislature created a statutory exception to the application of collateral estoppel in such cases.Contreras v. Miller Bonded, Inc., 2014-NMCA-011, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nWhere a municipal bus driver was terminated for cause; the bus driver's claim that the termination resulted from discrimination based on sex and medical condition was fully contested before the municipal personnel board; on appeal, the district court determined that there was substantial evidence to support the termination for cause and that the termination had not resulted from discrimination; and where a sheetmetal apprentice, who suffered a work injury and who did not give notice of the injury, was terminated for failure to show up for work; the sheetmetal apprentice's claim that the termination resulted from discrimination based on a serious medical condition was fully litigated before a workers' compensation judge who determined that the termination was for cause and that the sheetmetal apprentice had failed to give notice of the injury before the termination; on appeal, the court of appeals summarily affirmed the compensation order; the bus driver and the sheetmetal apprentice filed complaints in district court alleging that their terminations resulted from discrimination in violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act; and the district court determined that the bus driver and the sheetmetal apprentice were precluded by collateral estoppel from re-litigating their discrimination claims and granted summary judgment against them, the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the findings of an administrative agency have no collateral estoppel effect on actions filed under the New Mexico Human Rights Act.Contreras v. Miller Bonded, Inc., 2014-NMCA-011, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-012.\n\nHostile work environment sexual harassment.— Plaintiff presented a prima facie case of hostile work environment sexual harassment where supervisor began to harass plaintiff when supervisor became general manager of store where plaintiff worked, supervisor follower plaintiff around, supervisor would approach plaintiff when she was alone, stare at her, and touch himself in a sexually suggestive manner, supervisor would stand near plaintiff and stare at her breasts, supervisor usually had an erection when plaintiff saw him and he rubbed up against plaintiff with an erection on one occasion; supervisor parked his car next to plaintiff's car even though supervisor had a designated parking area, supervisor would appear out of nowhere when plaintiff went to the warehouse; and supervisor's behavior made plaintiff feel uncomfortable and supervisor's presence affected plaintiff's performance at work.Ocana v. Am. Furniture Co., 2004-NMSC-018, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58.\n\nVicarious liability of employer.— Employer may be held vicariously liable to employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate authority over the employee. Employer liability will be presumed where there is actionable sexual harassment and the harassing employee has supervisory authority over the victimized employee. Where no tangible employment action has been taken against the employee, the employer may rebut the presumption by proving that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexual harassing behavior and the employee reasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.Ocana v. Am. Furniture Co., 2004-NMSC-018, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58.\n\nSection applies only to de novo appeals from commission decision;when the administrative procedure was never invoked, a district court action was not an appeal under this section.Jaramillo v. J.C. Penney Co., 1985-NMCA-002, 102 N.M. 272, 694 P.2d 528.\n\nVenue. — The legislature intended that appeal for a trial de novo be limited to the district court of the county of the place elected by the commission to hear the complaint, as between a place of employer's doing business or of the alleged discriminatory practice.Montoya v. Super Save Warehouse Foods, 1991-NMSC-003, 111 N.M. 212, 804 P.2d 403.\n\nSection not overridden by Tort Claims Act.— The Tort Claims Act (Article 4 of Chapter 41 NMSA 1978) does not override or supersede the Human Rights Act so as to shield a governmental entity from liability otherwise flowing from a discriminatory practice proscribed by the latter act. This section constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity for liability imposed on public entities by the human rights commission, or by a district court on appeal from a commission decision, for violations of the Human Rights Act.Luboyeski v. Hill, 1994-NMSC-032, 117 N.M. 380, 872 P.2d 353.\n\nRemedies are not exclusive.— The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), 10-16C-1 through -6 NMSA 1978, and the New Mexico Human Rights Act (HRA), 28-1-1 through -15 NMSA 1978, are not in irreconcilable conflict; a plaintiff may state a WPA claim alongside a claim under the HRA.Herald v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of N.M., 2015-NMCA-104, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-009.\n\nWhere plaintiff, a resident physician at the university of New Mexico school of medicine, was dismissed from the residency program and brought suit against the board of regents of the university of New Mexico claiming that her termination was driven by discrimination and retaliation in violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act (HRA), 28-1-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., and the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), 10-16C-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., the district court erred in dismissing plaintiff's WPA claims on the grounds that the WPA and the HRA are irreconcilably conflicting and in concluding that plaintiff could therefore only proceed under the HRA.Herald v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of N.M., 2015-NMCA-104, cert. denied, 2015-NMCERT-009.\n\nAdmissibility of reports not in record.— Ordinary rules of evidence govern the admissibility of administrative findings, and the district court is not precluded from adherence to the hearsay evidence rule in ruling on the admissibility of official reports or statements that are not in the nature of a transcript of the record.Behrmann v. Phototron Corp., 1990-NMSC-073, 110 N.M. 323, 795 P.2d 1015.\n\n\"Actual damages\" construed.— The term \"actual damages\" in Subsection D is synonymous with compensatory damages, and excludes punitive damages. As for prospective damages, because they are a species of actual damages, they properly may be granted where evidence has been presented as to their present worth.Behrmann v. Phototron Corp., 1990-NMSC-073, 110 N.M. 323, 795 P.2d 1015.\n\nEvidence supporting award of front pay.— Evidence of plaintiff's inability to find full-time employment in his locality, despite his strenuous efforts, constitutes sufficient evidence of his inability to mitigate damages to support the court's discretion in determining that future employment would be unlikely and to support an award of front pay.Smith v. FDC Corp., 1990-NMSC-020, 109 N.M. 514, 787 P.2d 433.\n\nState immunity from interest not waived.— Subsection D of this section does not explicitly waive the state's immunity from post-judgment interest.Nava v. City of Santa Fe, 2004-NMSC-039, 136 N.M. 647, 103 P.3d 571.\n\nInterest not authorized.— Trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to assess interest on the judgment, fees, and costs in plaintiff's retaliation suit, because an interest award under Section 56-8-4 NMSA 1978 is not an absolute right, but rather is a matter to be left to the discretion of the trial court, and there is no authority suggesting that the phrase \"actual damages and reasonable attorney's fees\" in Subsection D of this section should be expanded to include interest.Gonzales v. N.M. Dep't of Health, 2000-NMSC-029, 129 N.M. 586, 11 P.3d 550.\n\nValidity of certain jury instructions.— The court did not abuse its discretion in giving \"sex stereotyping\" and \"absence-of-direct-proof\" instructions to the jury in an action brought by an employee who alleged that she was wrongfully terminated from her job as a salesperson because she became pregnant.Behrmann v. Phototron Corp., 1990-NMSC-073, 110 N.M. 323, 795 P.2d 1015.\n\nII. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.\n\nExhaustion of remedies against individual defendants required.— Individual defendants cannot be sued in district court under this article unless and until the complainant exhausts her administrative remedies against them.Luboyeski v. Hill, 1994-NMSC-032, 117 N.M. 380, 872 P.2d 353.\n\nLiability of individual.— Where plaintiff named only the corporation as a defendant in her complaint for discrimination before the human rights division, the president of the corporation was not now personally liable in district court because, while she exhausted her administrative remedies against the corporation, she failed to do so against the president individually.Sonntag v. Shaw, 2001-NMSC-015, 130 N.M. 238, 22 P.3d 1188.\n\nComplaint form denied filers the right to exhaust administrative remedies.— Where the charge of discrimination form prescribed by regulation of the human rights division instructed filers to identify the alleged discriminating agency by the name and address of the agency, but did not require any identification of individual agency employees involved in the discrimination, the form did not provide filers a fair and adequate opportunity to exhaust administrative remedies and preserve the right to pursue judicial remedies for liability against individual defendants under the Human Rights Act and filers who filed the prescribed form were not required to have exhausted administrative remedies against the previously unnamed individual defendants before pursuing their judicial remedies against the previously unnamed individual defendants.Lobato v. N.M. Env't Dep't, 2012-NMSC-002, 268 P.3d 1284.\n\nExhaustion of administrative remedies.— Even though the plaintiff had filed a sex discrimination complaint against her former employer only with the equal employment opportunity commission (EEOC), she exhausted her administrative remedies and could file an appeal in the district court because a work-sharing agreement between the EEOC and New Mexico human rights division (NMHRD) and NMHRD regulations provided that NMHRD procedural requirements were met by filing a complaint with either the NMHRD or the EEOC.Sabella v. Manor Care, Inc., 1996-NMSC-014, 121 N.M. 596, 915 P.2d 901.\n\nIII. TIME LIMITATIONS.\n\nTime limitations.— Where human rights division did not give plaintiff's attorney notice of its record of decision even though attorney filed an entry of appearance with the division, district court could find that the division's actions tolled the thirty-day time limit to file an appeal to district court and required district court to deny defendant's motion for summary judgment that plaintiff had not timely filed notice of appeal.Ocana v. Am. Furniture Co., 2004-NMSC-018, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58.\n\nTime limit on filing complaint.— Receiving a notice of right to sue from the equal employment opportunity commission did not satisfy the state law requirement of obtaining an order from the human rights division, nor did such notice affect the thirty-day time limit for filing an appeal from an order of the division in state court.Mitchell-Carr v. McLendon, 1999-NMSC-025, 127 N.M. 282, 980 P.2d 65.\n\nTime limits tolled.— Although the EEOC issued its decision in July, 1999, the division did not notify complainant's attorney of record of the decision because he was erroneously not put on the mail distribution list. Although the division normally corresponds with a complainant through his or her attorney once the attorney files an entry of appearance on the complainant's behalf, the division did not do this, and, as a result, complainant did not receive notice of the division's decision until much later. Thus, a fact-finder could find that the division's actions tolled the time limits.Ocana v. Am. Furniture Co., 2004-NMSC-018, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58.\n\nThe statute of limitations for a state law claim over which a federal district court exerts supplemental jurisdiction is tolled while the federal case is pending.— Where plaintiff brought a claim against her employer individually and the employer's dental practice for discrimination on the basis of sex under the New Mexico Human Rights Act (NMHRA), 28-1-1 to 28-1-14 NMSA 1978, and where plaintiff also filed a federal complaint seeking damages for unlawful discriminatory and retaliatory practices in violation of the NMHRA and a Title VII claim against the dental practice, the state district court erred in dismissing plaintiff's claim against the dental practice because plaintiff filed her amended complaint in state court while her federal case was pending, and under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d), the statute of limitations for any applicable state law claim over which a federal district court exerts supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d) is tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed by the federal court. The state district court, however, correctly dismissed plaintiff's NMHRA claim against her employer individually, because the employer was not named as a defendant in plaintiff's federal action, and therefore the federal court did not exert supplemental jurisdiction over that claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), and the statute of limitations on that claim as to the employer individually was not tolled under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d).Williams v. Mann, 2017-NMCA-012.\n\nIV. SCOPE OF REVIEW.\n\nScope of review.— In appeals from the human rights commission (now the human rights division of the department of labor), the district court, by virtue of specific provisions for trial de novo and jury trial, has the right to make an independent determination of the facts. The general rule in respect to appeals from administrative bodies is not applicable.Keller v. City of Albuquerque, 1973-NMSC-048, 85 N.M. 134, 509 P.2d 1329,overruled on other grounds,Green v. Kase, 113 N.M. 76, 823 P.2d 318.\n\nReview of transcript.— There is no statutory requirement that on de novo appeals from the commission, the jury or the judge must hear the transcript of the proceedings before the commission.Green v. Kase, 1992-NMSC-004, 113 N.M. 76, 823 P.2d 318.\n\nAdministrative review distinguished.— The scope of judicial review contemplated by this section is much broader than in appeals brought generally under the Administrative Procedures Act (12-8-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.), where judicial review is restricted to the record. School district appealing decision of human rights commission was not required to state grounds for appeal, and therefore its notice of appeal was effective to give the district court jurisdiction to try the case de novo.Linton v. Farmington Mun. Schs., 1974-NMSC-079, 86 N.M. 748, 527 P.2d 789.\n\nReview of jurisdiction.— Court of appeals has no authority to review a judgment of the district court on the issue of jurisdiction.Dominguez v. Stone, 1981-NMCA-146, 97 N.M. 211, 638 P.2d 423.\n\nV. ATTORNEY FEES.\n\nIn determining the reasonableness of an award of attorney's fees,a court should consider a variety of factors, including: (1) the time and effort required, considering the complexity of the issues and the skill required; (2) the customary fee in the area for similar services; (3) the results obtained and the amount of the controversy; (4) time limitations; and (5) the ability, experience, and reputation of the attorney performing the services.Smith v. FDC Corp., 1990-NMSC-020, 109 N.M. 514, 787 P.2d 433.\n\nRecovery of attorney's fees.— Time records do not constitute essential evidence for recovering attorney's fees.Lucero v. Aladdin Beauty Colls., Inc., 1994-NMSC-022, 117 N.M. 269, 871 P.2d 365.\n\nComputation of attorney fees.— Although the trial court did not determine what the customary fee would be, it did not abuse its discretion by awarding an amount that was approximate to the reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the reasonable number of hours spent on the case.Lucero v. Aladdin Beauty Colls., Inc., 1994-NMSC-022, 117 N.M. 269, 871 P.2d 365.\n\nRecovery of attorney fees.— Subsection D of this section may be interpreted to include attorney's fees for administrative proceedings, but in order to receive the fees, the complainant must prevail.Gonzales v. N.M. Dep't of Health, 2000-NMSC-029, 129 N.M. 586, 11 P.3d 550.\n\nFee award at $200 per hour, rather than requested rate of $230, was not abuse of discretion where trial court judge did not cut number of hours claimed and actually added five hours for work in connection with motions for fees, costs, and interest, and resulting award of $97,290.47 was approximately 34% of total judgment rendered by jury and was actually greater than judgment following remittitur.Nava v.
