No person may require an individual to disclose the results of a human immunodeficiency virus related test as a condition of hiring, promotion or continued employment, unless the absence of human immunodeficiency virus infection is a bona fide occupational qualification of the job in question.\n\nB. A person who asserts that a bona fide occupational qualification exists for disclosure of an individual's human immunodeficiency virus related test results shall have the burden of proving that:\n\n(1) the human immunodeficiency virus related test is necessary to ascertain whether an individual is currently able to perform in a reasonable manner the duties of the particular job or whether an individual will present a significant risk of transmitting human immunodeficiency virus to other persons in the course of normal work activities; and\n\n(2) there exists no reasonable accommodation short of requiring the test.\n\nHistory:Laws 1989, ch. 228, § 1.",
