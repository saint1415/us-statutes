      "text": "A. The construction of modern highways is necessary to promote public safety, facilitate the movement of present-day motor traffic, both interstate and intrastate in character, and to promote the national defense, and in the construction of such highways it is also in the public interest to provide for the orderly and economical relocation of utilities when made necessary by such highway improvements, including extensions thereof within urban areas, without occasioning utility service interruptions or unnecessary hazards to the health, safety and welfare of the traveling or utility consuming public.\n\nB. Utilities have been authorized by statute for many years to locate their facilities within the boundaries of public roads and streets in this state; because utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state agencies and they are affected with the public interest in that, among other things:\n\n(1) the business and activities of utilities involve the rendition of essential public services to large numbers of the general public, and no cessation of utility service is permitted without authority of law;\n\n(2) the financing of utilities involves the investment of large sums of money, including capital obtained from many members of the general public;\n\n(3) the development and extension of utilities directly affects the development, growth and expansion of the general welfare, business and industry of this state; and\n\n(4) all persons in this state are actual or potential consumers of one or more utility services, and all consumers will be affected by the cost of relocation of their utilities as necessary to accommodate highway improvements.\n\nPublic highways are intended principally for public travel and transportation; but they are also intended for proper utility uses in serving the public, as authorized pursuant to the laws of this state, and such utility uses are for the benefit of the public served. Without making use of public ways utility lines could not reach or economically service the adjacent public, particularly in urban areas.\n\nC. Federal-aid highways of the interstate system and other modern highway improvements serve the need of nonlocal and long distance traffic.\n\nD. The burden of such utility relocations is a burden on the public in this state, whether initially borne by the state or the utility or in part by both, and it is, therefore, in the public interest that such burden be minimized to the extent that same can be done consistently with the principal purpose of such highways for vehicular movement of persons and property; therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to insure that the state's police power in requiring relocation of utilities shall be exercised in a reasonable manner.\n\nE. Utility relocations necessitated by construction of public highways or improvements thereto are a public governmental function, properly a part of such construction and to the extent in this act [67-8-15 to 67-8-21 NMSA 1978] provided such relocations shall be made at state expense; however, although made in obedience to the commission's orders in exercise of the police power under this act, relocations hereunder for which compensation is not provided by this act or otherwise by law are declared to be damnum absque injuria and no claim therefor shall be enforceable against the state. Utility relocations to which this act is applicable shall be made only in pursuance hereof.\n\nF. The statements in this Section 1 [this section] are legislative determinations and declarations of public policy, and this act shall be liberally construed in conformity with its declarations and purposes to promote the public interest.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 55-7-23, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 310, § 1.\n\nPayment of nonbetterment costs not unconstitutional.— Laws 1959, ch. 310 (67-8-15 to 67-8-21 NMSA 1978) requiring the state to pay, in certain cases, the nonbetterment costs of relocation made necessary by highway improvement is not unconstitutional.State ex rel. City of Albuquerque v. Lavender, 1961-NMSC-096, 69 N.M. 220, 365 P.2d 652.\n\nObligation to state not released.— Laws 1959, ch. 310 (67-8-15 to 67-8-21 NMSA 1978) does not constitute a release of an obligation to the state.State ex rel. City of Albuquerque v. Lavender, 1961-NMSC-096, 69 N.M. 220, 365 P.2d 652.\n\nIn exercising its police power, the statemay legitimately and properly consider the effect, not only upon the entire public, but also upon particular segments thereof, and evolve a plan and scheme which will accomplish the greatest public good at the least expense to those adversely affected.State ex rel. City of Albuquerque v. Lavender, 1961-NMSC-096, 69 N.M. 220, 365 P.2d 652.\n\nApportionment, not donation.— In the passage of Laws 1959, ch. 310 (67-8-15 to 67-8-21 NMSA 1978), the legislature considered that the construction of interstate highways, through a community, is for the primary benefit of interstate travelers and public transportation facilities making use of such thoroughfares, rather than the citizens of the community itself.

The commission may, after notice and hearing, by order provide for the relocation of utility facilities within a public highway (including, if required, the entire removal therefrom of certain facilities except as necessary to serve abutting premises or as necessary to cross the highway) and may require any utility to make or suffer any such specified relocation, upon a finding that the action provided for is necessitated by highway improvement determined upon by the commission as a matter of policy relating to the design, construction, location and maintenance of public highways; and the commission shall direct and control the reasonable manner and time of effecting any such relocation so as to promote the public interest in the highway improvement without undue cost or risk and without impairment of utility service, whether the commission undertakes the relocation on behalf of the state or requires the utility to perform such relocation.

      "text": "A. In the following types of utility relocation ordered by the commission pursuant to Section 3 A [67-8-17A NMSA 1978] it shall either, as it elects, undertake the relocation work on behalf of the state, paying the cost of relocation, or reimburse the utility for the cost of relocation:\n\n(1) relocations necessitated by improvements of public highways in the interstate system, including extensions thereof within urban areas; and\n\n(2) relocations by complete removal and construction of facilities off the public highway.\n\nThe commission is authorized upon notice and opportunity for hearing to find and determine in relocations hereunder the cost of relocation, and the same shall, to the extent authorized herein, be borne by the state as other highway construction costs.\n\nThe commission is authorized to make rules and regulations with respect to the advancement and/or payment from time to time of funds by utilities to insure that the state shall never advance nor pay any costs which it is not authorized by law to pay, including rules and regulation [regulations] with respect to the proper determination of cost of relocation payable or reimbursable by the state, to aid the commission in carrying out the intention of this act [67-8-15 to 67-8-21 NMSA 1978]; and this provisions [provision] shall be cumulative of other authority possessed by the commission to promulgate rules and regulations.\n\nB. Exceptions:\n\n(1) the cost of relocation from which a utility would be otherwise relieved pursuant to Subparagraph A (1) above shall nevertheless be borne in full by the utility in any of the following cases, without reimbursement from the state:\n\n(a) in case of a privately owned utility which is obligated, or to the extent it is obligated by valid, written contract with the state to make such relocation when called for by the state without cost to the latter;\n\n(b) in case the utility line was initially installed, or for the distance to which it was installed, under a valid statute or regulation applicable thereto and providing that relocation should be effected by the owner thereof at the latter's expense;\n\n(c) in case of relocation of a utility facility not municipally owned for which local municipal or county government authorization, if required by law, had not been granted;\n\n(d) in case the utility shall after effectiveness of this act agree for a valid consideration to effect the relocation at its expense under the terms of such agreement; or\n\n(e) in case of any required relocation with respect to which the commission shall determine that the utility failed without just cause to make or suffer such relocation in the reasonable manner and time as prescribed by the commission.\n\nC. The commission shall make no reimbursement payment to a utility to which it is otherwise entitled pursuant to Subsection A above unless and until the commission is satisfied that relocation has been fully completed in accordance with the commission's requirements; and the commission shall in no event make reimbursement of any cost otherwise due under Subsection A above which it finds, after notice and hearing, to have been unnecessarily, negligently or improvidently incurred by the utility.\n\nD. To insure that the state shall never pay any cost of relocation necessitated by improvement in the interstate system for which it cannot receive proportionate reimbursement under the 1956 Federal Aid Highway Act, as amended, if upon final determination by the United States bureau of public roads of the cost of relocation of a utility relocation necessitated by the construction or improvement of a public highway in the interstate system, the bureau of public roads shall finally determine the cost of relocation to be not reimbursable to the state from federal funds or to be less than the amount reimbursed to the utility by the commission, the utility so reimbursed shall repay to the commission the difference between the amount so reimbursed to the utility and the cost of relocation finally determined by the bureau of public roads.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 55-7-26, enacted by Laws 1959, ch. 310, § 4.\n\nBracketed material.— The bracketed material in Subsection A was inserted by the compiler for purposes of clarity; it was not enacted by the legislature and is not a part of the law.\n\n\"United States bureau of public roads\".— The former United States bureau of public roads, referred to in Subsection D, became the federal highway administration pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 104. However, that section was repealed in 1994 as part of the revision of Title 49. The reference should now be to the department of transportation.\n\n1956 Federal Aid Highway Act.— The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, referred to in Subsection D, is codified as 23 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.\n\nAlternative writ of mandamus is made absolutein proceeding by city to require state highway commission (now state transportation commission) to reimburse it for relocations of water and sewer lines, made necessary by reason of construction of federal aid highways on the interstate and primary system.State ex rel.
