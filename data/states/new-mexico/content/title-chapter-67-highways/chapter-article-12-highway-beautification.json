The commission may so remove the outdoor advertising if at the time of the acquisition:\n\n(1) the outdoor advertising bears the requisite permit, if any;\n\n(2) the owner of the outdoor advertising has timely paid all permit fees, past and present, if any, required in connection with the erection and maintenance thereof;\n\n(3) the outdoor advertising conforms with standards, specifications and requirements contained in regulations promulgated by the commission; and\n\n(4) the outdoor advertising was lawfully in existence on the effective date of the Highway Beautification Act and has continued to so exist, or was lawfully erected subsequent to the effective date. For the purpose of this paragraph, any outdoor advertising in existence on or after November 6, 1978, that was erected prior to November 18, 1971 under any permit or conditional permit issued by the state highway department shall be considered to be lawfully erected. For all purposes the effective date of the New Mexico Highway Beautification Act shall be March 15, 1971.\n\nThe condemnation shall be exercised by eminent domain in the manner provided by law, and each interested party shall have the right to a separate trial as to the respective interests involved.\n\nB. Whenever outdoor advertising and property rights pertaining thereto are acquired by the commission pursuant to Subsection A of this section:\n\n(1) the owner of the outdoor advertising shall be paid just compensation by the commission equal to the fair market value of the outdoor advertising which is to be deemed a trade fixture; and\n\n(2) the owner of the land upon which the outdoor advertising is located shall be paid just compensation equal to the value of his right to have the outdoor advertising erected and maintained on the land.\n\nC. The right to compensation as provided in Subsection B of this section shall not be affected solely by the failure of any outdoor advertising to conform to standards, specifications and requirements contained in regulations promulgated by the commission relating to any subject other than permits or permit fees unless the commission has given notice by certified mail to the owner of the land upon which the outdoor advertising is located, and to the owner of the outdoor advertising if his name appears thereon, advising of the failure to conform and ordering that the outdoor advertising be made to so conform or be removed within thirty days from the date of such notice. If the failure to conform is corrected within the thirty days, then the failure to conform shall be deemed cured for all purposes; if, however, the defect is not corrected within the thirty days, the commission may thereafter remove the outdoor advertising at the expense of the owner of the outdoor advertising without any compensation whatsoever. This subsection specifically does not apply in any manner to permit fees, and no notice whatsoever shall be required in connection with the permit fees.\n\nD. Compensation shall not include any element of damages which is not subject to federal aid participation under the federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965, as has been or may be hereafter amended or superseded, or otherwise.\n\nE. In any case where outdoor advertising has been removed under the Highway Beautification Act, and the removal is compensable under that act, but the commission has not paid just compensation or instituted condemnation proceedings therefor, the owner of the outdoor advertising, or the owner of the land upon which it is located, or both, may bring actions against the commission as provided in Section 42-1-23 NMSA 1978, for recovery of such compensation.\n\nF. All outdoor advertising other than that meeting all the requirements of Subsection A of this section is declared to be a public nuisance and in contravention of law. Therefore and otherwise, the commission may remove or cause the removal of all outdoor advertising other than that meeting all the requirements of Subsection A of this section which removal shall be without any compensation whatsoever and at the expense of the owner of the outdoor advertising.\n\nG. Removal of outdoor advertising by or at the request of the commission, its agents or employees in compliance with the Highway Beautification Act does not subject such removal or the persons performing it to criminal prosecution or give rise to any liability to any person or entity for the injury, loss or destruction of any property which occurs in connection with the removal.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 55-11-6, enacted by Laws 1966, ch. 65, § 6; 1967, ch. 140, § 3; 1971, ch. 108, § 4; 1975, ch. 193, § 3; 1981, ch. 371, § 1.\n\nThe 1981 amendmentdivided the former language in the introductory paragraph of Subsection A into two sentences and substituted \"The commission may so\" for \"and\" and \"the\" for \"said\" following \"of\" and deleted \"the outdoor advertising\" following \"if\" in the second sentence therein, added the last two sentences in Subsection A(4), added \"the outdoor advertising\" at the beginning of Paragraphs (1) and (3) and of the first sentence in Paragraph (4) of Subsection A, added \"if any\" at the end of Subsection A(1), added \"the owner of the outdoor advertising\" at the beginning of, and inserted \"if any\" in Subsection A(2), substituted \"the\" for \"said\" following \"to\" in the first sentence in Subsection A(4) and deleted \"said\" preceding \"thirty days, then\" in the next to last sentence in Subsection C.\n\nCompiler's notes.— The effective date of the Highway Beautification Act is May 19, 1966.\n\nSection 42-1-23 NMSA 1978, referred to near the end of Subsection E, was repealed by Laws 1981, ch. 125, § 62.

For the year 1972 and every year thereafter, the license fee shall be deemed timely paid if, but only if, said fee is received by the commission on or before the first day of the year for which said fee is being paid. Failure of timely payment of said fee shall render the junkyard subject to removal, disposal and abatement by the commission without any compensation whatsoever, and at the cost of the owner thereof.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 55-11-8, enacted by Laws 1966, ch. 65, § 8; 1971, ch. 108, § 5.",

The commission may screen, at its expense, any junkyard located within one thousand feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way of the interstate and primary systems and visible from the main-traveled way thereof, if the commission considers such screening feasible and the junkyard:\n\n(1) was lawfully in existence on the effective date of the Highway Beautification Act, and has continued to so exist, or the junkyard lawfully came §1 into existence subsequent thereto under circumstances whereby screening or removal from sight were not required by law; and\n\n(2) has had timely paid therefor all license fees, past and present, required in connection with the establishment, operation and maintenance thereof.\n\nB. If the commission does not consider such screening economical or feasible due to the topography of the land or otherwise, it may require the relocation, removal or disposal of the junkyard or junk thereon located by negotiation or condemnation, if the junkyard meets the requirements of Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Subsection A.\n\nC. Whenever relocation, removal or disposal is required by the commission pursuant to Subsection B:\n\n(1) the owner of the junkyard shall be paid just compensation therefor by the commission, which shall include, but not be limited to, acquisition costs, leasehold value and moving costs; and\n\n(2) the owner of the land upon which the junkyard is located shall be paid just compensation equal to the value of his right to have the junkyard established, operated and maintained on the land.\n\nD. Compensation shall not include any element of damages which is not subject to federal aid participation by virtue of the federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965, as has been or may hereafter be amended or superseded, or otherwise.\n\nE. In any case where a junkyard has been removed, relocated or disposed of, pursuant to the Highway Beautification Act, and such removal is compensable under it, but the commission has not paid just compensation or instituted condemnation proceedings therefor, the owner of the junkyard or the owner of the land upon which it is located, or both, may bring action against the commission as provided in Section 42-1-23 NMSA 1978, for recovery of such compensation.\n\nF. The commission may remove, relocate or dispose of, or cause the removal, relocation or disposal of all junkyards other than those described in Subsections A and B hereof, without any compensation whatsoever and at the expense of the owner of the junkyard.\n\nG. Removal, relocation or disposal of junkyards by or at the request of the commission, its agents or employees in compliance with the Highway Beautification Act does not subject such removal or the persons performing same to criminal prosecution or give rise to any liability to any person or entity for the injury, loss or destruction of any property which occurs in connection with the said removal.\n\nH. When the commission determines that it is in the best interest of the state, it may acquire such land or interest in land as is necessary to provide adequate screening for junkyards.\n\nHistory:1953 Comp., § 55-11-9, enacted by Laws 1966, ch. 65, § 9; 1967, ch. 140, § 4; 1971, ch. 108, § 6.\n\nHighway Beautification Act.— The federal Highway Beautification Act is codified as 23 U.S.C. §§ 131, 135, 136, and 139.",
