Laws and rules designed and intended to apply to medicare supplement insurance policies may not be applied to long-term care insurance. A policy which is not advertised, marketed, or offered as long-term care insurance or nursing facility insurance need not meet the requirements of this chapter.\n\nSource:SL 1989, ch 440, §1.",
