Control is presumed to exist if a person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing ten percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact;\n\n(7)\"Covered claim,\"\n\n(a)An unpaid claim, including one for unearned premiums, submitted by a claimant, which arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which this chapter applies issued by an insurer, if the insurer becomes an insolvent insurer after July 1, 1970, and:\n\n(i)The claimant or insured is a resident of this state at the time of the insured event. However, for entities other than an individual, the residence of a claimant, insured, or policyholder is the state in which its principal place of business is located at the time of the insured event; or\n\n(ii)The claim is a first party claim for damage to property with a permanent location in this state.\n\n(b)The term, covered claim, does not include:\n\n(i)Any amount awarded as punitive or exemplary damages;\n\n(ii)Any amount sought as a return of premium under any retrospective rating plan;\n\n(iii)Any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association as subrogation recoveries, reinsurance recoveries, contribution, indemnification, or otherwise.

An insured's net worth shall be deemed to include the aggregate net worth of the insured and any of its subsidiaries and affiliates as calculated on a consolidated basis;\n\n(v)Any first party claims by an insured which is an affiliate of the insolvent insurer;\n\n(8)\"Insolvent insurer,\" an insurer authorized to transact insurance in this state, either at the time the policy was issued or when the insured event occurred, and against whom a final order of liquidation has been entered after July 1, 1970, with a finding of insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction in the insurer's state of domicile;(9)\"Member insurer,\" any person who:(a)Writes any kind of insurance to which this chapter applies, including the exchange of reciprocal or interinsurance contracts; and(b)Is licensed to transact insurance in this state except companies defined in chapter 58-35.An insurer shall cease to be a member insurer effective on the day following the termination or expiration of its license to transact the kinds of insurance to which this chapter applies, however, the insurer shall remain liable as a member insurer for any obligations, including obligations for assessments levied prior to the termination or expiration of the insurer's license and assessments levied after the termination or expiration, with respect to any insurer that became an insolvent insurer prior to the termination or expiration of the insurer's license;(10)\"Net direct written premiums,\" direct gross premiums written in this state on insurance policies to which this chapter applies, less return premiums thereon and dividends paid or credited to policyholders on such direct business.
