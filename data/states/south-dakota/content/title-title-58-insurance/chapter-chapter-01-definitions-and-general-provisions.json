Exemption of charitable gift annuity from insurance regulation--Qualified organization.\n\nNo provision of Title 58 applies to any qualified organization which issues a charitable gift annuity within this state if the qualified organization has operated for a period of ten years and has a minimum of five hundred thousand dollars in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, or publicly traded securities, exclusive of the assets funding the annuity agreement as of the date of the annuity agreement. For the purposes of this section, a charitable gift annuity means a giving plan or method by which a gift of cash or other property is made to a qualified organization in exchange for its agreement to pay an annuity. For the purposes of this section, a qualified organization means an organization which is either domiciled in South Dakota and has its principal place of business in South Dakota or is qualified to do business in South Dakota as a foreign corporation, and which is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as a charitable organization and regularly files a copy of Federal Form 990 in the Office of the Attorney General or is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as a religious organization or is exempt as a publicly owned or nonprofit, privately endowed educational institution approved, accredited, or licensed by the South Dakota Board of Education Standards, the north central association of colleges and schools, or an equivalent public authority of the jurisdiction where the institution is located.\n\nSource:SL 1994, ch 370, §1; SL 2001, ch 265, §1; SL 2017, ch 81, §57.",
