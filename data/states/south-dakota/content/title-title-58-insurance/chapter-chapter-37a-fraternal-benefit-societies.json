All statements on the application are representations and not warranties. Any waiver of this provision is void.\n\nAny changes, additions or amendments to the laws of the society made or enacted after the issuance of the certificate, bind the owner and the beneficiaries, and govern and control the benefit contract in all respects the same as though the changes, additions, or amendments had been made before and were in force at the time of the application for insurance.

If the payment is not made either it stands as an indebtedness against the certificate and shall draw interest not to exceed the rate specified for certificate loans under the certificates or in lieu of or in combination with the indebtedness, the owner may accept a proportionate reduction in benefits under the certificate. The society may specify the manner of the election and which alternative is to be presumed if no election is made.\n\nCopies of any of the documents provided for in this section, certified by the secretary or corresponding officer of the society, shall be received in evidence of the terms and conditions thereof.\n\nNo certificate may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless a copy of the form has been filed with the director in the manner provided for like policies issued by life and health insurers in this state. Every life, accident, health, or disability insurance certificate and every annuity certificate issued on or after one year from January 1, 1991, shall meet the standard contract provision requirements consistent with this chapter for like policies issued by life and health insurers in this state. However, a society may provide for a grace period for payment of premiums of one full month in its certificates. The certificate shall also contain a provision stating the amount of premiums which are payable under the certificate and a provision reciting or setting forth the substance of any sections of the society's laws or rules in force at the time of issuance of the certificate which, if violated, shall result in the termination or reduction of benefits payable under the certificate. If the laws of the society provide for expulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate shall also contain a provision that any member expelled or suspended, except for nonpayment of a premium or within the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membership or insurance, may maintain the certificate in force by continuing payment of the premium.\n\nBenefit contracts issued on the lives of persons below the society's minimum age for adult membership may provide for transfer of control of ownership to the insured at an age specified in the certificate.
