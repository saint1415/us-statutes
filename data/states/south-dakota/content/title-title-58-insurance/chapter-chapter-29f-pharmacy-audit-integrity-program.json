Audit terms.\n\nUnless otherwise prohibited by federal statutes or regulations, for any entity conducting a pharmacy audit the following audit items apply:\n\n(1)The period covered by the audit may not exceed twenty-four months from the date that the claim was submitted to or adjudicated by the entity, unless a longer period is required under state or federal law;\n\n(2)If an entity uses random sampling as a method for selecting a set of claims for examination, the sample size shall be appropriate for a statistically reliable sample. Notwithstanding any other provision, the auditing entity shall provide the pharmacy a masked list that provides a prescription number or date range that the auditing entity is seeking to audit;\n\n(3)An on-site audit may not take place during the first five business days of the months of December and January unless the pharmacy consents;\n\n(4)An auditor may not enter any portion of the pharmacy area where patient-specific information is available unless escorted, and to the extent possible shall remain out of sight and hearing range of the pharmacy patients;\n\n(5)Any recoupment may not be deducted against future remittances until final completion of any appeals process and both parties have received the results of the final audit;\n\n(6)A pharmacy benefits manager may not require information to be written on a prescription unless the information is required to be written on the prescription by state or federal law. Recoupment may be assessed for items not written on the prescription if:\n\n(a)Additional information is required in the provider manual; or\n\n(b)The information is required by the Food and Drug Administration; or\n\n(c)The information is required by the drug manufacturer's product safety program; and\n\n(d)The information in subsections (a), (b), or (c) is not readily available for the auditor at the time of the audit;\n\n(7)The auditing company or agent may not receive payment based on a percentage of the amount recovered. This section does not prevent the entity conducting the audit from charging or assessing the responsible party, directly or indirectly, based on amounts recouped if:\n\n(a)The plan sponsor and the entity conducting the audit have a contract that explicitly states the percentage charge or assessment to the plan sponsor; and\n\n(b)A commission to an agent or employee of the entity conducting the audit is not based, directly or indirectly, on amounts recouped.\n\nSource:SL 2013, ch 254, §5.",

Recoupment or chargeback criteria.\n\nFor recoupment or chargeback, the following criteria apply:\n\n(1)Audit parameters shall consider consumer-oriented parameters based on manufacturer listings;\n\n(2)A pharmacy's usual and customary price for compounded medications is considered the reimbursable cost unless the pricing methodology is outlined in the provider contract;\n\n(3)A finding of overpayment or underpayment can only be based on the actual overpayment or underpayment and not a projection based on the number of patients served having a similar diagnosis or on the number of similar orders or refills for similar drugs;\n\n(4)The entity conducting the audit may not use extrapolation in calculating the recoupment or penalties for audits unless required by state or federal law or regulation;\n\n(5)Calculations of overpayments may not include dispensing fees unless:\n\n(a)A prescription was not actually dispensed;\n\n(b)The prescriber denied authorization;\n\n(c)The prescription dispensed was a medication error by the pharmacy; or\n\n(d)The identified overpayment is solely based on an extra dispensing fee;\n\n(6)An entity may not consider any clerical or record-keeping error, such as a typographical error, scrivener's error, or computer error regarding a required document or record as fraud. However, such errors may be subject to recoupment;\n\n(7)In the case of errors that have no actual financial harm to the patient or plan, the pharmacy benefits manager may not assess any chargebacks. Errors that are a result of the pharmacy's failing to comply with a formal corrective action plan may be subject to recovery; and\n\n(8)Interest may not accrue during the audit period for either party. The audit period begins with the notice of the audit and ends with the final audit report.\n\nSource:SL 2013, ch 254, §6.",
