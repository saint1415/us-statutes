Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified and the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy. The basic cash value is equal to the present value, on the anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary.

The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year is an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in §§58-15-35 to 58-15-38, inclusive, or §§58-15-43.1 to 58-15-43.11, inclusive, whichever is applicable. That percentage must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of the fifth policy anniversary and the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in the preceding may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years. However, no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in §§58-15-35 to 58-15-38, inclusive, or §§58-15-43.1 to 58-15-43.11, inclusive, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.\n\nAll adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other sections of this chapter.

Except for a private placement policy the company may reserve the right to defer the payment of the cash surrender benefit for a period not to exceed six months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract after making written request and receiving written approval of the director. The request shall address the necessity and equitability to all policyholders of the deferral. In the case of a private placement policy, the company may reserve the right to defer the payment of the cash surrender value attributable to separate account assets until such assets can, by their respective terms, be converted to cash, which may be greater than six months after demand for such surrender value with surrender of the contract;\n\n(3)A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of the benefits; and\n\n(4)A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which the benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract, and indebtedness to the company on the contact, or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.\n\nNotwithstanding the requirements of this section, a deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from prior considerations paid would be less than twenty dollars monthly, the company may, at its option, terminate the contract by payment in cash of the then present value of the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis on the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by this payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under the contract.\n\nSource:SL 2004, ch 299, §3; SL 2006, ch 252, §7.",
