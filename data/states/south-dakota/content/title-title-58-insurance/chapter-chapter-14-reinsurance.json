Credit for reinsurance for reinsurers in reciprocal jurisdictions--Eligibility requirements.\n\nCredit must be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer with its head office or domicile in a reciprocal jurisdiction in compliance with §§ 58-14-16.23 to 58-14-16.34, inclusive. A reciprocal jurisdiction is a jurisdiction that meets one of the following:\n\n(1)A non-United States jurisdiction subject to an in-force covered agreement with the United States, each within its legal authority, or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and European Union, is a member state of the European Union. For purposes of this chapter, a covered agreement is an agreement entered into pursuant to Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 313 and 314, that is currently in effect or in a period of provisional application and addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this state or for allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance;\n\n(2)A United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program; or\n\n(3)A qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the director pursuant to this chapter, that is not otherwise described in subdivisions (1) or (2) of this section and that the director determines meets the following additional requirements:\n\n(a)Provides that an insurer that has its head office or is domiciled in a qualified jurisdiction is allowed credit for reinsurance ceded to a United States-domiciled assuming insurer in the same manner as credit for reinsurance is allowed for reinsurance assumed by insurers domiciled in a qualified jurisdiction;\n\n(b)Does not require a United States-domiciled assuming insurer to establish or maintain a local presence as a condition for entering into a reinsurance agreement with any ceding insurer subject to regulation by the non-United States jurisdiction or as a condition to allow the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance;\n\n(c)Recognizes the United States state regulatory approach to group supervision and group capital, by providing written confirmation by a competent regulatory authority in a qualified jurisdiction that insurers and insurance groups that are domiciled or maintain their headquarters in this state or another jurisdiction accredited by the NAIC shall be subject only to worldwide prudential insurance group supervision including worldwide group governance, solvency and capital, and reporting by the director or the insurance commissioner of the domiciliary state and will not be subject to group supervision at the level of the worldwide parent undertaking of the insurance or reinsurance group by the qualified jurisdiction; and\n\n(d)Provides written confirmation by a competent regulatory authority in the qualified jurisdiction that information regarding insurers and their parent, subsidiary, or affiliated entities shall be provided to the director in accordance with a memorandum of understanding or similar document between the director and the qualified jurisdiction, including the International Association of Insurance Supervisors Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding or other multilateral memoranda of understanding coordinated by the NAIC.\n\nSource:SL 2021, ch 211, § 1.",
