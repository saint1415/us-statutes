If the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as the dependent child's coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits shall be determined, as applicable, pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section to the dependent child's parent or parents and the dependent's spouse.\n\nSource:SL 2006, ch 259, §18; SL 2015, ch 253, §2.",
