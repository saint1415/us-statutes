If the property of the insurer does not contain sufficient cash or liquid assets to defray the costs incurred, the director may advance the costs so incurred out of any appropriation for the maintenance of the Division of Insurance. Any amounts so advanced for expenses of administration shall be repaid to the director for the use of the Division of Insurance out of the first available money of the insurer;\n\n(5)Hold hearings, subpoena witnesses to compel their attendance, administer oaths, examine any person under oath, and compel any person to subscribe to the person's testimony after it has been correctly reduced to writing, and, in connection therewith, require the production of any books, papers, records, or other documents which the liquidator considers relevant to the inquiry;\n\n(6)Collect all debts and money due and claims belonging to the insurer, wherever located, and, for this purpose:\n\n(a)To institute timely action in other jurisdictions, in order to forestall garnishment and attachment proceedings against such debts;\n\n(b)To do such other acts as are necessary or expedient to collect, conserve, or protect its assets or property, including the power to sell, compound, compromise, or assign debts for purposes of collection upon such terms and condition as the liquidator deems best; and\n\n(c)To pursue any creditor's remedies available to enforce the creditor's claims;\n\n(7)Conduct public and private sales of the property of the insurer;\n\n(8)Use assets of the estate of an insurer under a liquidation order to transfer policy obligations to a solvent assuming insurer, if the transfer can be arranged without prejudice to applicable priorities under §58-29B-124;\n\n(9)Acquire, hypothecate, encumber, lease, improve, sell, transfer, abandon, or otherwise dispose of or deal with, any property of the insurer at its market value or upon such terms and conditions as are fair and reasonable.
