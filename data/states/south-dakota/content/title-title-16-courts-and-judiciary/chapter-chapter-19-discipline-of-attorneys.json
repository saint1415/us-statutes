Suspension from practice on conviction of serious crime--Setting aside order.\n\nIf any attorney has been convicted of a serious crime, the Supreme Court may enter an order immediately suspending the attorney from engaging in the practice of law, pending final disposition of a disciplinary proceeding to be commenced upon such conviction. The term \"serious crime\" includes any felony and any lesser crime a necessary element of which, as determined by the statutory or common law definition of such crime, involves improper conduct as an attorney, interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, willful failure to file income tax returns, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft, or an attempt or a conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a serious crime. Upon good cause shown, the Supreme Court may set aside such order suspending the attorney from engaging in the practice of law when it appears in the interest of justice so to do. An order suspending an attorney from the practice of law pursuant to this section is a suspension of the attorney for the purpose of §§16-19-74 to 16-19-82, inclusive, unless the Supreme Court shall otherwise order.\n\nSource:Sup.
