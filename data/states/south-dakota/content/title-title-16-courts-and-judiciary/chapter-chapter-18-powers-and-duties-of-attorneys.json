If such admission is sought to any court of this state by a nonresident attorney, the applicant shall first file with the court wherein he or she seeks admission a written sworn motion requesting admission.

As advisor, a lawyer provides a client with an informed understanding of the client's legal rights and obligations and explains their practical implications. As advocate, a lawyer zealously asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system. As negotiator, a lawyer seeks a result advantageous to the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealings with others. As an evaluator, a lawyer acts by examining a client's legal affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.\n\n[3] In addition to these representational functions, a lawyer may serve as a third-party neutral, a nonrepresentational role helping the parties to resolve a dispute or other matter. Some of these rules apply directly to lawyers who are or have served as third-party neutrals. See, e.g., Rules 1.12 and 2.4. In addition, there are rules that apply to lawyers who are not active in the practice of law or to practicing lawyers even when they are acting in a nonprofessional capacity. For example, a lawyer who commits fraud in the conduct of a business is subject to discipline for engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. See Rule 8.4.\n\n[4] In all professional functions a lawyer should be competent, prompt and diligent. A lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the representation. A lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure is required or permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.\n\n[5] A lawyer's conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer's business and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the law's procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others. A lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other lawyers and public officials. While it is a lawyer's duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of official action, it is also a lawyer's duty to uphold legal process.\n\n[6] As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, access to the legal system, the administration of justice and the quality of service rendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond its use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law and work to strengthen legal education. In addition, a lawyer should further the public's understanding of and confidence in the rule of law and the justice system because legal institutions in a constitutional democracy depend on popular participation and support to maintain their authority. A lawyer should be mindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor, cannot afford adequate legal assistance. Therefore, all lawyers should devote professional time and resources and use civic influence to ensure equal access to our system of justice for all those who because of economic or social barriers cannot afford or secure adequate legal counsel. A lawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the public interest.\n\n[7] Many of a lawyer's professional responsibilities are prescribed in the Rules of Professional Conduct, as well as substantive and procedural law. However, a lawyer is also guided by personal conscience and the approbation of professional peers. A lawyer should strive to attain the highest level of skill, to improve the law and the legal profession and to exemplify the legal profession's ideals of public service.\n\n[8] A lawyer's responsibilities as a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen are usually harmonious. Thus, when an opposing party is well represented, a lawyer can be a zealous advocate on behalf of a client and at the same time assume that justice is being done. So also, a lawyer can be sure that preserving client confidences ordinarily serves the public interest because people are more likely to seek legal advice, and thereby heed their legal obligations, when they know their communications will be private.\n\n[9] In the nature of law practice, however, conflicting responsibilities are encountered. Virtually all difficult ethical problems arise from conflict between a lawyer's responsibilities to clients, to the legal system and to the lawyer's own interest in remaining an ethical person while earning a satisfactory living. The Rules of Professional Conduct often prescribe terms for resolving such conflicts. Within the framework of these Rules, however, many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. Such issues must be resolved through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral judgment guided by the basic principles underlying the Rules. These principles include the lawyer's obligation zealously to protect and pursue a client's legitimate interests, within the bounds of the law, while maintaining a professional, courteous and civil attitude toward all persons involved in the legal system.\n\n[10] The legal profession is largely self-governing. Although other professions also have been granted powers of self-government, the legal profession is unique in this respect because of the close relationship between the profession and the processes of government and law enforcement. This connection is manifested in the fact that ultimate authority over the legal profession is vested largely in the courts.\n\n[11] To the extent that lawyers meet the obligations of their professional calling, the occasion for government regulation is obviated. Self-regulation also helps maintain the legal profession's independence from government domination. An independent legal profession is an important force in preserving government under law, for abuse of legal authority is more readily challenged by a profession whose members are not dependent on government for the right to practice.\n\n[12] The legal profession's relative autonomy carries with it special responsibilities of self-government. The profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulations are conceived in the public interest and not in furtherance of parochial or self-interested concerns of the bar. Every lawyer is responsible for observance of the Rules of Professional Conduct. A lawyer should also aid in securing their observance by other lawyers. Neglect of these responsibilities compromises the independence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.\n\n[13] Lawyers play a vital role in the preservation of society. The fulfillment of this role requires an understanding by lawyers of their relationship to our legal system. The Rules of Professional Conduct, when properly applied, serve to define that relationship.\n\n[14] The Rules of Professional Conduct are rules of reason. They should be interpreted with reference to the purposes of legal representation and of the law itself. Some of the Rules are imperatives, cast in the terms “shall” or “shall not.” These define proper conduct for purposes of professional discipline. Others, generally cast in the term “may,” are permissive and define areas under the Rules in which the lawyer has discretion to exercise professional judgment. No disciplinary action should be taken when the lawyer chooses not to act or acts within the bounds of such discretion. Other Rules define the nature of relationships between the lawyer and others. The Rules are thus partly obligatory and disciplinary and partly constitutive and descriptive in that they define a lawyer's professional role. Many of the Comments use the term “should.” Comments do not add obligations to the Rules but provide guidance for practicing in compliance with the Rules.\n\n[15] The Rules presuppose a larger legal context shaping the lawyer's role. That context includes court rules and statutes relating to matters of licensure, laws defining specific obligations of lawyers and substantive and procedural law in general. The Comments are sometimes used to alert lawyers to their responsibilities under such other law.\n\n[16] Compliance with the Rules, as with all law in an open society, depends primarily upon understanding and voluntary compliance, secondarily upon reinforcement by peer and public opinion and finally, when necessary, upon enforcement through disciplinary proceedings. The Rules do not, however, exhaust the moral and ethical considerations that should inform a lawyer, for no worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules. The Rules simply provide a framework for the ethical practice of law.\n\n[17] Furthermore, for purposes of determining the lawyer's authority and responsibility, principles of substantive law external to these Rules determine whether a client-lawyer relationship exists. Most of the duties flowing from the client-lawyer relationship attach only after the client has requested the lawyer to render legal services and the lawyer has agreed to do so. But there are some duties, such as that of confidentiality under Rule 1.6, that attach when the lawyer agrees to consider whether a client-lawyer relationship shall be established. See Rule 1.18. Whether a client-lawyer relationship exists for any specific purpose can depend on the circumstances and may be a question of fact.\n\n[18] Under various legal provisions, including constitutional, statutory and common law, the responsibilities of government lawyers may include authority concerning legal matters that ordinarily reposes in the client in private client-lawyer relationships. For example, a lawyer for a government agency may have authority on behalf of the government to decide upon settlement or whether to appeal from an adverse judgment. Such authority in various respects is generally vested in the attorney general and the state's attorney in state government, and their federal counterparts, and the same may be true of other government law officers. Also, lawyers under the supervision of these officers may be authorized to represent several government agencies in intragovernmental legal controversies in circumstances where a private lawyer could not represent multiple private clients. These Rules do not abrogate any such authority.\n\n[19] Failure to comply with an obligation or prohibition imposed by a Rule is a basis for invoking the disciplinary process. The Rules presuppose that disciplinary assessment of a lawyer's conduct will be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances as they existed at the time of the conduct in question and in recognition of the fact that a lawyer often has to act upon uncertain or incomplete evidence of the situation. Moreover, the Rules presuppose that whether or not discipline should be imposed for a violation, and the severity of a sanction, depend on all the circumstances, such as the willfulness and seriousness of the violation, extenuating factors and whether there have been previous violations.\n\n[20] Violation of a Rule should not itself give rise to a cause of action against a lawyer nor should it create any presumption in such a case that a legal duty has been breached. In addition, violation of a Rule does not necessarily warrant any other non-disciplinary remedy, such as disqualification of a lawyer in pending litigation. The Rules are designed to provide guidance to lawyers and to provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies. They are not designed to be a basis for civil liability. Furthermore, the purpose of the Rules can be subverted when they are invoked by opposing parties as procedural weapons. The fact that a Rule is a just basis for a lawyer's self-assessment, or for sanctioning a lawyer under the administration of a disciplinary authority, does not imply that an antagonist in a collateral proceeding or transaction has standing to seek enforcement of the Rule. Nevertheless, since the Rules do establish standards of conduct by lawyers, a lawyer's violation of a Rule may be evidence of breach of the applicable standard of conduct.\n\n[21] The Comment accompanying each Rule explains and illustrates the meaning and purpose of the Rule. The Preamble and this note on Scope provide general orientation. The Comments are intended as guides to interpretation, but the text of each Rule is authoritative.\n\nSource: SL 2022, ch 249 (Supreme Court Rule 21-08), eff.

A contingent fee agreement shall be in writing signed by the client and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement, trial or appeal; litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery; and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is calculated. The agreement must clearly notify the client of potential expenses for which the client will be liable whether or not the client is the prevailing party.

Conflict of Interest: Current Clients\n\n(a) Except as provided by paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if:\n\n(1)the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or\n\n(2)there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:\n\n(1)the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;\n\n(2)the representation is not prohibited by law;\n\n(3)the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or same matter before a tribunal; and\n\n(4)each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.\n\nRule 1.8.

For purposes of this paragraph, related persons include a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or other relative or individual with whom the lawyer or the client maintains a close, familial relationship.\n\n(d) Prior to the conclusion of representation of a client, a lawyer shall not make or negotiate an agreement giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial part on information relating to the representation.\n\n(e) A lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation, except that:\n\n(1)A lawyer may advance court costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter;\n\n(2)A lawyer representing an indigent client may pay court costs and expenses of litigation on behalf of the client; and\n\n(3)A lawyer representing an indigent client pro bono, a lawyer representing an indigent client pro bono through a nonprofit legal services or public interest organization, and a lawyer representing an indigent client pro bono through a law school clinical or pro bono program may provide modest gifts to the client for food, lodging, transportation, and other expenses incidental to the representation. The lawyer:\n\n(i) May not promise, assure or imply the availability of such gifts prior to retention or as an inducement to continue the client-lawyer relationship after retention;\n\n(ii)May not seek or accept reimbursement from the client, a relative of the client or anyone affiliated with the client; and\n\n(iii)May not publicize or advertise a willingness to provide such gifts to prospective clients.\n\nFinancial assistance under this rule may be provided even if the representation is eligible for fees under a fee-shifting statute.\n\n(f) A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless:\n\n(1)the client gives informed consent;\n\n(2)there is no interference with the lawyer's independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship; and\n\n(3)information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by Rule 1.6.\n\n(g) A lawyer who represents two or more clients shall not participate in making an aggregate settlement of the claims of or against the clients, or in a criminal case an aggregated agreement as to guilty or nolo contendere pleas, unless each client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client. The lawyer's disclosure shall include the existence and nature of all the claims or pleas involved and of the participation of each person in the settlement.\n\n(h) A lawyer shall not:\n\n(1)make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer's liability to a client for malpractice unless the client is independently represented in making the agreement, or\n\n(2)settle a claim or potential claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or former client unless that person is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel in connection therewith.\n\n(i) A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may:\n\n(1)acquire a lien authorized by law to secure the lawyer's fee or expenses; and\n\n(2)contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil case.\n\n(j) A lawyer shall not have sexual relations with a client unless a consensual sexual relationship existed between them before the client-lawyer relationship commenced.\n\n(k) While lawyers are associated in a firm, a prohibition in the foregoing paragraphs (a) through (i) that applies to any one of them shall apply to all of them.\n\nSource: SL 2004, ch 327 (Supreme Court Rule 03-26), eff.

Special Conflicts of Interest for Former and Current Government Officers and Employees\n\n(a) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer who has formerly served as a public officer or employee of the government:\n\n(1)is subject to Rule 1.9(c); and\n\n(2)shall not otherwise represent a client in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee, unless the appropriate government agency gives its informed consent, confirmed in writing, to the representation.\n\n(b) When a lawyer is disqualified from representation under paragraph (a), no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter unless:\n\n(1)the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and\n\n(2)written notice is promptly given to the appropriate government agency to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.\n\n(c) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer having information that the lawyer knows is confidential government information about a person acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee, may not represent a private client whose interests are adverse to that person in a matter in which the information could be used to the material disadvantage of that person. As used in this Rule, the term \"confidential government information\" means information that has been obtained under governmental authority and which, at the time this Rule is applied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the public or has a legal privilege not to disclose and which is not otherwise available to the public. A firm with which that lawyer is associated may undertake or continue representation in the matter only if the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom.\n\n(d) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer currently serving as a public officer or employee:\n\n(1)is subject to Rules 1.7, 1.9, and 1.13 and\n\n(2)shall not:\n\n(i)participate in a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially while in private practice or nongovernmental employment, unless the appropriate government agency gives its informed consent, confirmed in writing; or\n\n(ii)negotiate for private employment with any person who is involved as a party or as lawyer for a party in a matter in which the lawyer is participating personally and substantially, except that a lawyer serving as a law clerk to a judge, other adjudicative officer or arbitrator may negotiate for private employment as permitted by Rule 1.12(b) and subject to the conditions stated in Rule 1.12(b).\n\n(e) As used in this Rule, the term \"matter\" includes:\n\n(1)any judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, investigation, charge, accusation, arrest or other particular matter involving a specific party or parties, and\n\n(2)any other matter covered by the conflict of interest rules of the appropriate government agency.\n\nRule 1.12.

Organization as Client\n\n(a) A lawyer employed or retained by an organization represents the organization acting through its duly authorized constituents.\n\n(b) If a lawyer for an organization knows that an officer, employee or other person associated with the organization is engaged in action, intends to act or refuses to act in a matter related to the representation that is a violation of a legal obligation to the organization, or a violation of law that reasonably might be imputed to the organization, and that is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, then the lawyer shall proceed as is reasonably necessary in the best interest of the organization. Unless the lawyer reasonably believes that it is not necessary in the best interest of the organization to do so, the lawyer shall refer the matter to higher authority in the organization, including, if warranted by the circumstances to the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization as determined by applicable law.\n\n(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d), if:\n\n(1)Despite the lawyer's efforts in accordance with paragraph (b) the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization insists upon or fails to address in a timely and appropriate manner an action, or a refusal to act, that is clearly a violation of law, and\n\n(2)The lawyer reasonably believes that the violation is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the organization, then the lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation whether or not Rule 1.6 permits such disclosure, but only if and to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent substantial injury to the organization.\n\n(d) Paragraph (c) shall not apply with respect to information relating to a lawyer's representation of an organization to investigate an alleged violation of law, or to defend the organization or an officer, employee or other constituent associated with the organization against a claim arising out of an alleged violation of law.\n\n(e) A lawyer who reasonably believes that he or she has been discharged because of the lawyer's actions taken pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c), or who withdraws under circumstances that require or permit the lawyer to take action under either of those paragraphs, shall proceed as the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to assure that the organization's highest authority is informed of the lawyer's discharge or withdrawal.\n\n(f) In dealing with an organization's directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents, a lawyer shall explain the identity of the client when the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the organization's interests are adverse to those of the constituents with whom the lawyer is dealing.\n\n(g) A lawyer representing an organization may also represent any of its directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents, subject to the provisions of Rule 1.7. If the organization's consent to the dual representation is required by Rule 1.7, the consent shall be given by an appropriate official of the organization other than the individual who is to be represented, or by the shareholders.\n\nSource: SL 2004, ch 327 (Supreme Court Rule 03-26), eff.

Client With Diminished Capacity\n\n(a) When a client's capacity to make adequately considered decisions in connection with a representation is diminished, whether because of minority, mental impairment or for some other reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client.\n\n(b) When the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has diminished capacity, is at risk of substantial physical, financial or other harm unless action is taken and cannot adequately act in the client's own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action, including consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem, conservator or guardian.\n\n(c) Information relating to the representation of a client with diminished capacity is protected by Rule 1.6. When taking protective action pursuant to paragraph (b), the lawyer is impliedly authorized under Rule 1.6(a) to reveal information about the client, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the client's interests.\n\nRule 1.15. Safekeeping Property\n\n(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer's possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer's own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained in the state where the lawyer's office is situated, or elsewhere with the consent of the client or third party. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation. A lawyer may deposit the lawyer's own funds in a client trust account for the sole purpose of paying bank service charges on that account, but only in an amount necessary for that purpose. A lawyer shall deposit into a client trust account legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred.\n\n(b) Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third party has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third party. Except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third party any funds or other property that the client or third party is entitled to receive and, upon request by the client or third party, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.\n\n(c) When in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which two or more persons (one of whom may be the lawyer) claim interests, the property shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved. The lawyer shall promptly distribute all portions of the property as to which the interests are not in dispute.\n\n(d) Preserving Identity of Funds and Property of Client.\n\n(1)All funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, shall be deposited in one or more identifiable bank accounts maintained in the state in which the law office is situated and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm shall be deposited therein except as follows:\n\n(i)Funds reasonably sufficient to pay bank charges may be deposited therein.\n\n(ii)Funds belonging in part to a client and in part presently or potentially to the lawyer or law firm must be deposited therein, but the portion belonging to the lawyer or law firm may be withdrawn when due unless the right of the lawyer or law firm to receive it is disputed by the client, in which event the disputed portion shall not be withdrawn until the dispute is finally resolved.\n\n(2)A lawyer shall:\n\n(i)Promptly notify a client of the receipt of his funds, securities, or other properties.\n\n(ii)Identify and label securities and properties of a client promptly upon receipt and place them in a safe deposit box or other place of safekeeping as soon as practicable.\n\n(iii)Maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accountings to his client regarding them.\n\n(iv)Promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive.\n\n(3)A lawyer shall create and maintain an interest-bearing account for clients' funds which are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time in compliance with the following provisions:\n\n(i)No earnings from such an account shall be made available to a lawyer or firm.\n\n(ii)The account shall include all clients' funds which are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time.\n\n(iii) An interest-bearing trust account shall be established with any bank authorized by federal or state law to do business in South Dakota and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Funds in each interest-bearing trust account shall be subject to withdrawal upon request and without delay.\n\n(iv)The rate of interest payable on any interest-bearing trust account shall not be less than the rate paid by the depository institution to regular, nonlawyer depositors unless reduced to offset bank administrative costs. Higher rates offered by the institution to customers whose deposits exceed certain time or quantity minima, such as those offered in the form of certificates of deposit, may be obtained by a lawyer or law firm on some or all of deposit funds so long as there is no impairment of the right to withdraw or transfer principal immediately.\n\n(4)Lawyers or law firms depositing client funds in a trust savings account shall direct the depository institution:\n\n(i)To remit interest or dividends, net of any service charges or fees, on the average monthly balance in the account, or as otherwise computed in accordance with an institution's standard accounting practice, at least quarterly, to the South Dakota Bar Foundation;\n\n(ii)To transmit with each remittance to the Foundation a statement showing the name of the lawyer or law firm for whom the remittance is sent and the rate of interest applied; and\n\n(iii)To transmit to the depositing lawyer or law firm at the same time a report showing the amount paid to the Foundation, the rate of interest applied, and the average account balance of the period for which the report is made.\n\n(e) Considerations\n\n(1)This is a mandatory program for lawyers and law firms, whether proprietorships, partnerships or professional corporations or other business organization for the practice of law who hold clients' or third party's funds.\n\n(2)The program shall apply to all clients whose funds on deposit are either nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time.\n\n(3)The following principles shall apply to clients' funds which are held by lawyers and law firms:\n\n(i)No earnings from the funds may be made available to any lawyer or law firm.\n\n(ii)Upon request of the client, earnings may be made available to the client whenever possible upon deposited funds which are neither nominal in amount nor are to be held for a short period of time; however, traditional attorney-client relationships do not compel attorneys to either invest clients' funds or to advise clients to make their funds productive.\n\n(iii)Clients' funds which are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time shall be retained in an interest-bearing checking or savings trust account, with the interest (net of any service charge or fees) made payable to the South Dakota Bar Foundation.\n\n(iv)The determination of whether clients' funds are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time rests in the sound judgment of each attorney or law firm. Such judgment is not subject to review. In making this determination the lawyer or law firm may consider the cost of establishing, maintaining and accounting for an individual client interest bearing trust account against the anticipated interest which would accrue to the benefit of the client.\n\n(v)Notification of clients whose funds are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time is unnecessary for lawyers and law firms.\n\n(4)The following principles shall apply to those clients' funds held in individual trust accounts established by lawyers or law firms not participating in the program:\n\n(i)No earnings from the funds may be made available to any lawyer or law firm.\n\n(ii)Upon request of a client, earnings may be made available to client whenever possible on deposited funds which are neither nominal in amount nor to be held for a short period of time; however, traditional attorney-client relationships do not compel attorneys either to invest clients' funds or to advise clients to make their funds productive.\n\n(iii)Clients' funds which are nominal in amount or to be held for short periods of time, and for which individual income generation and allocation is not arranged with a financial institution, must be retained in a non-interest-bearing, demand trust account.\n\n(iv)The determination of whether clients' funds are nominal in amount or to be held for a short period of time rests in the sound judgment of each attorney or law firm.\n\n(5)Interest paid to the South Dakota Bar Foundation will be used for the following purposes:\n\n(i)To help prevent crime;\n\n(ii)To facilitate and improve the delivery of civil and criminal legal services and the administration of justice;\n\n(iii)To encourage law-related education in the schools (K-12);\n\n(iv)To encourage law-related education of adults including seminars and programs for charitable, civic and senior citizens groups;\n\n(v)To give the general public information about how the courts and lawyers function; and\n\n(vi)To issue publications educating the public about the United States legal system.\n\n(6)Nonresident attorneys licensed to practice in South Dakota who comply with applicable IOLTA requirements in the state wherein they maintain their office are exempt from paragraph (3).\n\n(7)A lawyer or law firm may petition the Supreme Court for a one-year exemption from mandatory participation in IOLTA upon the following grounds:\n\n(i)The expected interest to be earned on the trust account is likely to be exceeded by bank charges imposed for participating in IOLTA; and\n\n(ii)There is no reasonable alternative bank available to the lawyer or law firm whereby the likely interest to be earned would exceed bank charges for participating in IOLTA; or\n\n(iii)Upon convincing grounds satisfactory to the Supreme Court for an exemption.\n\n(iv)A petition for exemption may be filed in subsequent years if the petitioning lawyer or law firm meets the requirements of sections 7 (i), and 7 (ii) or section 7 (iii).\n\n(v)The petition shall include documents establishing the grounds for exemption.\n\n(vi)The petition for exemption shall be submitted to the Clerk of the Supreme Court. A copy of the petition shall be mailed to the State Bar of South Dakota.\n\nSource: SL 2004, ch 327 (Supreme Court Rule 03-26), eff. Jan. 1, 2004; SL 2017, ch 223 (Supreme Court Rule 16-68), eff.

When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.\n\n(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.\n\nRule 1.17. Sale of Law Practice\n\nA lawyer or a law firm may sell or purchase a law practice, or an area of law practice, including good will, if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n(a) The agreement shall be in writing and may contain restrictions on the practice of law by the seller, and the seller may be the estate of a deceased lawyer.\n\n(b) The entire practice, or the entire area of practice, is sold to one or more lawyers or law firms;\n\n(c) The seller gives written notice to each of the seller's clients regarding:\n\n(1)the proposed sale;\n\n(2)the client's right to retain other counsel or to take possession of the file; and\n\n(3)the fact that the client's consent to the transfer of the client's files will be presumed if the client does not take any action or does not otherwise object within ninety (90) days of receipt of the notice. If a client cannot be given notice, the representation of that client may be transferred to the purchaser only upon entry of an order so authorizing by a court having jurisdiction. The seller may disclose to the court in camera information relating to the representation only to the extent necessary to obtain an order authorizing the transfer of a file.\n\n(d) The fees charged clients shall not be increased by reason of sale.\n\nRule 1.18. Duties to Prospective Client\n\n(a) A person who consults with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter is a prospective client.\n\n(b) Even when no client-lawyer relationship ensues, a lawyer who has learned information from a prospective client shall not use or reveal that information, except as in Rule 1.9 would permit with respect to information of a former client.\n\n(c) A lawyer subject to paragraph (b) shall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in paragraph (d).

When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that a party does not understand the lawyer's role in the matter, the lawyer shall explain the difference between the lawyer's role as a third-party neutral and a lawyer's role as one who represents a client.\n\nRule 3.1. Meritorious Claims and Contentions\n\nA lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.

If a lawyer, the lawyer's client, or a witness called by the lawyer, has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall timely take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence, other than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal matter, that the lawyer reasonably believes is false. However, in a criminal matter, the lawyer shall not participate with the client in the presentation of the client's testimony which the lawyer knows to be false.\n\n(b) A lawyer who represents a client in an adjudicative proceeding and who knows that a person intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent conduct related to the proceeding shall timely take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.\n\n(c) The duties stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) continue to the conclusion of the proceeding, and apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.\n\n(d) In an ex parte proceeding, except grand juries and applications for search warrants, a lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer that will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse.\n\nRule 3.4.
