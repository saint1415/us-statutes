      "heading": "SOUTH DAKOTA CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT",
      "text": "APPENDIX A. APPENDIX A TO CHAPTER 16-2\n\nSOUTH DAKOTA CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT\n\nOur legal system is based on the principle that an independent, impartial,* fair and competent judiciary will interpret and apply the laws that govern us. The role of the judiciary is central to American concepts of justice and the rule of law. Intrinsic to all sections of this Code are the precepts that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial office as a public trust and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in our legal system. The judge is an arbiter of facts and law for the resolution of disputes and a highly visible symbol of government under the rule of law.\n\nThe Code of Judicial Conduct is intended to establish standards for ethical conduct of judges. It consists of broad statements called Canons, specific rules set forth in Sections under each Canon, a Terminology Section, an Application Section and Commentary. The text of the Canons and the Sections, including the Terminology and Application Sections, is authoritative. The Commentary, by explanation and example, provides guidance with respect to the purpose and meaning of the Canons and Sections. The Commentary is not intended as a statement of additional rules. When the text uses \"shall\" or \"shall not,\" it is intended to impose binding obligations the violation of which can result in disciplinary action. When \"should\" or \"should not\" is used, the text is intended as hortatory and as a statement of what is or is not appropriate conduct but not as a binding rule under which a judge may be disciplined. When \"may\" is used, it denotes permissible discretion or, depending on the context, it refers to action that is not covered by specific proscriptions.\n\nThe Canons and Sections are rules of reason. They should be applied consistent with constitutional requirements, statutes, other court rules and decisional law and in the context of all relevant circumstances. The Code is not to be construed so as to impinge on the essential independence of judges in making judicial decisions or on judges' or candidates' * First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and association but should be construed to protect the due process rights of litigants to impartial courts and to promote public confidence in the judiciary.\n\nThe Code is designed to provide guidance to judges and candidates * for judicial office and to provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies. It is not designed or intended as a basis for civil liability or criminal prosecution. Furthermore, the purpose of the Code would be subverted if the Code were invoked by lawyers for mere tactical advantage in a proceeding.\n\nThe text of the Canons and Sections is intended to govern conduct of judges and to be binding upon them. It is not intended, however, that every transgression will result in disciplinary action. Whether disciplinary action is appropriate, and the degree of discipline to be imposed, should be determined through a reasonable and reasoned application of the text and should depend on such factors as the seriousness of the transgression, whether there is a pattern of improper activity and the effect of the improper activity on others or on the judicial system. See ABA Standards Relating to Judicial Discipline and Disability Retirement.\n\nThe Code of Judicial Conduct is not intended as an exhaustive guide for the conduct of judges. They should also be governed in their judicial and personal conduct by general ethical standards. The Code is intended, however, to state basic standards which should govern the conduct of all judges and to provide guidance to assist judges in establishing and maintaining high standards of judicial and personal conduct.\n\nSource: SL 1993, ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 93-15), eff. July 1, 1993; SL 2006, ch 274 (Supreme Court Rule 05-13), eff. Jan. 1, 2006.\n\nTERMINOLOGY\n\nTerms explained below are noted with an asterisk (*) in the Sections where they appear.

See Sections 3D(1) and 3D(2).\n\n\"Candidate.\" A candidate is a person seeking selection for or retention in judicial office by election or appointment. A person becomes a candidate for judicial office as soon as he or she makes a public announcement of candidacy, declares or files as a candidate with the election or appointment authority, or authorizes solicitation or acceptance of contributions or support. The term Acandidate@ has the same meaning when applied to a judge seeking election or appointment to non-judicial office. See Preamble and Sections 3E(1)(e), 3E(3), 5A, 5B, 5C and 5E.\n\n\"Continuing part-time judge.\" A continuing part-time judge is a judge who serves repeatedly on a part-time basis by election or under a continuing appointment, including a retired judge subject to recall who is permitted to practice law. (This term includes part-time law and lay magistrates, as well as retired judges. This code applies to retired judges unless the retired judge files a statement of nonconsent to be recalled for judicial service with the Clerk of the South Dakota Supreme Court.) See Application Section C.\n\n\"Court personnel\" does not include the lawyers in a proceeding before a judge. See Sections 3B(7)(c) and 3B(9).\n\n\"De minimis\" denotes an insignificant interest that could not raise reasonable question as to a judge's impartiality. See Sections 3E(1)(c) and 3E(1)(d).\n\n\"Economic interest\" denotes ownership of a more than de minimis legal or equitable interest, or a relationship as officer, director, advisor or other active participant in the affairs of a party, except that:\n\n(i)Ownership of an interest in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not an economic interest in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund or a proceeding pending or impending before the judge could substantially affect the value of the interest;\n\n(ii)Service by a judge as an officer, director, advisor or other active participant in an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic organization, or service by a judge's spouse, parent or child as an officer, director, advisor or other active participant in any organization does not create an economic interest in securities held by that organization;\n\n(iii)A deposit in a financial institution, the proprietary interest of a policy holder in a mutual insurance company, of a depositor in a mutual savings association or of a member in a credit union, or a similar proprietary interest, is not an economic interest in the organization unless a proceeding pending or impending before the judge could substantially affect the value of the interest;\n\n(iv)Ownership of government securities is not an economic interest in the issuer unless a proceeding pending or impending before the judge could substantially affect the value of the securities.\n\nSee Sections 3E(1)(c) and 3E(2).\n\n\"Fiduciary\" includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee, and guardian. See Sections 3E(1), 3E(2) and 4E.\n\n\"Impartiality\" denotes absence of bias or prejudice in favor of, or against, particular parties or classes of parties, as well as maintaining an open mind in considering issues that may come before the judge. See Preamble and Sections 1A, 2A, 3B(10), 3E, 4A, 5A(3).\n\n\"Knowingly,\" \"knowledge,\" \"known\" or \"knows\" denotes actual knowledge of the fact in question. A person's knowledge may be inferred from circumstances. See Sections 3D, 3E(1), and 5A(3).\n\n\"Law\" denotes court rules as well as statutes, constitutional provisions, and decisional law. See Sections 2A, 3A, 3B(2), 4B, 4C, 4D(5), 4F, 4I, 5A(2), 5B(2), 5C(1), 5C(3) and 5D.\n\n\"Member of the candidate's family\" denotes a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, or other relative or person with whom the candidate maintains a close familial relationship. See Section 5A(3)(a).\n\n\"Member of the judge's family\" denotes a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, or other relative or person with whom the judge maintains a close familial relationship. See Sections 4D(5), 4E and 4G.\n\n\"Member of the judge's family residing in the judge's household\" denotes any relative of a judge by blood or marriage, or a person treated by a judge as a member of the judge's family, who resides in the judge's household. See Sections 3E(1) and 4D(5).\n\n\"Nonpublic information\" denotes information that, by law, is not available to the public. Nonpublic information may include but is not limited to: information that is sealed by statute or court order, impounded or communicated in camera; and information offered in grand jury proceedings, presentencing reports, dependency cases or psychiatric reports. See Section 3B(12).\n\n\"Periodic part-time judge.\" A periodic part-time judge is a judge who serves or expects to serve repeatedly on a part-time basis but under a separate appointment for each limited period of service or for each matter. This term includes child support referees. See Application Section D.\n\n\"Political organization\" denotes a political party or other group, the principal purpose of which is to further the election or appointment of candidates to political office. See Sections 5A(1), 5B(2) and 5C(1).\n\n\"Pro tempore part-time judge.\" A pro tempore part-time judge is a judge who serves or expects to serve once or only sporadically on a part-time basis under a separate appointment for each period of service or for each case heard. This term applies to referees and masters appointed under Rule 53, except child support referees. See Application Section E.\n\n\"Public election.\" This term includes primary and general elections; it includes partisan elections, nonpartisan elections and retention elections. See Section 5C.\n\n\"Require.\" The rules prescribing that a judge \"require\" certain conduct of others are, like all of the rules in this Code, rules of reason. The use of the term \"require\" in that context means a judge is to exercise reasonable direction and control over the conduct of those persons subject to the judge's direction and control. See Sections 3B(3), 3B(4), 3B(6), 3B(9) and 3C(2).\n\n\" Third degree of relationship.\" The following persons are relatives within the third degree of relationship: great-grandparent, grandparent, parent, uncle, aunt, brother, sister, child, grandchild, great-grandchild, nephew or niece. See Section 3E(1)(d).\n\nSource: SL 1993, ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 93-15), eff. July 1, 1993; SL 2006, ch 274 (Supreme Court Rule 05-13), eff. Jan. 1, 2006; SL 2006, ch 274 (Supreme Court Rule 05-13), eff. July 1, 2013.\n\nCANON 1 A Judge Shall Uphold the Integrity, Impartiality and Independence of the Judiciary\n\nA. An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society. A judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity, impartiality * and independence of the judiciary will be preserved. The provisions of this Code are to be construed and applied to further that objective.\n\nDeference to the judgments and rulings of courts depends upon public confidence in the integrity, impartiality and independence of judges. The integrity, impartiality and independence of judges depends in turn upon their acting without fear or favor. A judiciary of integrity is one in which judges are known for their probity, fairness, honesty, uprightness, and soundness of character. An independent judiciary is one free of inappropriate outside influences. Although judges should be independent, they must comply with the law, including the provisions of this Code. Public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary is maintained by the adherence of each judge to this responsibility. Conversely, violation of this Code diminishes public confidence in the judiciary and thereby does injury to the system of government under law.\n\nSource: SL 1993, ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 93-15), eff. July 1, 1993; SL 2006, ch 274 (Supreme Court Rule 05-13), eff. Jan. 1, 2006.\n\nCANON 2 A Judge Shall Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety in All of the Judge's Activities\n\nA. A judge shall respect and comply with the law * and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality * of the judiciary.\n\nPublic confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety. A judge must expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny. A judge must therefore accept restrictions on the judge's conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly, without impinging on the judge's or candidate's First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and association. Examples are the restrictions on judicial speech imposed by Sections 3(B)(9) and (10) that are indispensable to the maintenance of the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the judiciary.\n\nThe prohibition against behaving with impropriety or the appearance of impropriety applies to both the professional and personal conduct of a judge. Because it is not practicable to list all prohibited acts, the proscription is necessarily cast in general terms that extend to conduct by judges that is harmful although not specifically mentioned in the Code. Actual improprieties under this standard include violations of law, court rules or other specific provisions of this Code. The test for appearance of impropriety is whether the conduct would create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge's ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with integrity, impartiality and competence is impaired.\n\nSee also Commentary under Section 2C.\n\nB. A judge shall not allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence the judge's judicial conduct or judgment. A judge shall not lend the prestige of judicial office to advance the private interests of the judge or others; nor shall a judge convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge. A judge shall not testify voluntarily as a character witness.\n\nMaintaining the prestige of judicial office is essential to a system of government in which the judiciary functions independently of the executive and legislative branches. Respect for the judicial office facilitates the orderly conduct of legitimate judicial functions. Judges should distinguish between proper and improper use of the prestige of office in all of their activities. For example, it would be improper for a judge to allude to his or her judgeship to gain a personal advantage such as deferential treatment when stopped by a police officer for a traffic offense. Similarly, judicial letterhead must not be used for conducting a judge's personal business.\n\nA judge must avoid lending the prestige of judicial office for the advancement of the private interests of others. For example, a judge must not use the judge's judicial position to gain advantage in a civil suit involving a member of the judge's family. In contracts for publication of a judge's writings, a judge should retain control over the advertising to avoid exploitation of the judge's office. As to the acceptance of awards, see Section 4D(5)(a) and Commentary.\n\nAlthough a judge should be sensitive to possible abuse of the prestige of office, a judge may, based on the judge's personal knowledge, serve as a reference or provide a letter of recommendation. However, a judge must not initiate the communication of information to a sentencing judge or a probation or corrections officer but may provide to such persons information for the record in response to a formal request.\n\nJudges may participate in the process of judicial selection by cooperating with appointing authorities and screening committees seeking names for consideration, and by responding to official inquiries concerning a person being considered for a judgeship. See also Canon 5 regarding use of a judge's name in political activities.\n\nA judge must not testify voluntarily as a character witness because to do so may lend the prestige of the judicial office in support of the party for whom the judge testifies. Moreover, when a judge testifies as a witness, a lawyer who regularly appears before the judge may be placed in the awkward position of cross-examining the judge. A judge may, however, testify when properly summoned. Except in unusual circumstances where the demands of justice require, a judge should discourage a party from requiring the judge to testify as a character witness.\n\nC. A judge shall not hold membership in any organization that practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin.\n\nMembership of a judge in an organization that practices invidious discrimination gives rise to perceptions that the judge's impartiality is impaired. Section 2C refers to the current practices of the organization. Whether an organization practices invidious discrimination is often a complex question to which judges should be sensitive. The answer cannot be determined from a mere examination of an organization's current membership rolls but rather depends on how the organization selects members and other relevant factors, such as that the organization is dedicated to the preservation of religious, ethnic or cultural values of legitimate common interest to its members, or that it is in fact and effect an intimate, purely private organization whose membership limitations could not be constitutionally prohibited. Absent such factors, an organization is generally said to discriminate invidiously if it arbitrarily excludes from membership on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin persons who would otherwise be admitted to membership. See New York State Club Ass'n. Inc. v. City of New York, 108 S. Ct. 2225, 101 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1988); Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537, 107 S. Ct. 1940 (1987), 95 L. Ed. 2d 474; Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1984).\n\nOrganizations dedicated to the preservation of religious, fraternal, sororal, spiritual, charitable, civic, or cultural values, which do not stigmatize any excluded persons as inferior and therefore unworthy of membership, are not considered to discriminate invidiously.\n\nAlthough Section 2C relates only to membership in organizations that invidiously discriminate on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin, a judge's membership in an organization that engages in any discriminatory membership practices prohibited by the law of the jurisdiction also violates Canon 2 and Section 2A and gives the appearance of impropriety. In addition, it would be a violation of Canon 2 and Section 2A for a judge to arrange a meeting at a club that the judge knows practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin in its membership or other policies, or for the judge to regularly use such a club. Moreover, public manifestation by a judge of the judge's knowing approval of invidious discrimination on any basis gives the appearance of impropriety under Canon 2 and diminishes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary, in violation of Section 2A.\n\nWhen a person who is a judge on the date this Code becomes effective learns that an organization to which the judge belongs engages in invidious discrimination that would preclude membership under Section 2C or under Canon 2 and Section 2A, the judge is permitted, in lieu of resigning, to make immediate efforts to have the organization discontinue its invidiously discriminatory practices, but is required to suspend participation in any other activities of the organization. If the organization fails to discontinue its invidiously discriminatory practices as promptly as possible (and in all events within a year of the judge's first learning of the practices), the judge is required to resign immediately from the organization.\n\nSource: SL 1993, ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 93-15), eff.

Judicial Duties in General. The judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all the judge's other activities. The judge's judicial duties include all the duties of the judge's office prescribed by law.* In the performance of these duties, the following standards apply.\n\nB. Adjudicative Responsibilities.\n\n(1)A judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge except those in which disqualification is required.\n\n(2)A judge shall be faithful to the law * and maintain professional competence in it. A judge shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism.\n\n(3)A judge shall require * order and decorum in proceedings before the judge.\n\n(4)A judge shall be patient, dignified and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity, and shall require * similar conduct of lawyers, and of staff, court officials and others subject to the judge's direction and control.\n\nB(4) COMMENTARY\n\nThe duty to hear all proceedings fairly and with patience is not inconsistent with the duty to dispose promptly of the business of the court. Judges can be efficient and businesslike while being patient and deliberate.\n\n(5)A judge shall perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice. A judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice, including but not limited to bias or prejudice based upon race, sex, religion, national origin, disability or age, and shall not permit staff, court officials and others subject to the judge's direction and control to do so.\n\n(6)A judge shall require * lawyers in proceedings before the judge to refrain from manifesting, by words or conduct, bias or prejudice based upon race, sex, religion, national origin, disability or age, against parties, witnesses, counsel or others. This Section 3B(6) does not preclude legitimate advocacy when race, sex, religion, national origin, disability or age, or other similar factors, are issues in the proceeding.\n\nB(5) and (6) COMMENTARY\n\nA judge must refrain from speech, gestures or other conduct that could reasonably be perceived as sexual harassment or sexual misconduct and must require the same standard of conduct of others subject to the judge's direction and control. Sexual harassment or sexual misconduct by a judge while engaging in judicial or administrative responsibilities or any law-related functions undermines the confidence in the legal profession and the legal system and, as a result, is prejudicial to the administration of justice. Sexual harassment or sexual misconduct includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other objectively offensive verbal or physical conduct or communications sexual in nature.\n\nA judge must perform judicial duties impartially and fairly. A judge who manifests bias on any basis in a proceeding impairs the fairness of the proceeding and brings the judiciary into disrepute. Facial expression and body language, in addition to oral communication, can give to parties or lawyers in the proceeding, jurors, the media and others an appearance of judicial bias. A judge must be alert to avoid behavior that may be perceived as prejudicial.\n\n(7)A judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or that person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to Law.* A judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications, or consider other communications made to the judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending or impending proceeding except that:\n\n(a)Where circumstances require, ex parte communications for scheduling, administrative purposes or emergencies that do not deal with substantive matters or issues on the merits are authorized; provided:\n\n(i)the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural or tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte communication, and\n\n(ii)the judge makes provision promptly to notify all other parties of the substance of the ex parte communication and allows an opportunity to respond.\n\n(b)A judge may obtain the advice of a disinterested expert on the law * applicable to a proceeding before the judge if the judge gives notice to the parties of the person consulted and the substance of the advice, and affords the parties reasonable opportunity to respond.\n\n(c)A judge may consult with court personnel * whose function is to aid the judge in carrying out the judge's adjudicative responsibilities or with other judges.\n\n(d)A judge may, with the consent of the parties, confer separately with the parties and their lawyers in an effort to mediate or settle matters pending before the judge.\n\n(e)A judge may initiate or consider any ex parte communications when expressly authorized by law * to do so or when serving on problem-solving courts, treatment courts or drug courts.\n\nB(7) COMMENTARY\n\nThe proscription against communications concerning a proceeding includes communications from lawyers, law teachers, and other persons who are not participants in the proceeding, except to the limited extent permitted.\n\nTo the extent reasonably possible, all parties or their lawyers shall be included in communications with a judge.\n\nWhenever presence of a party or notice to a party is required by Section 3B(7), it is the party's lawyer, or if the party is unrepresented the party, who is to be present or to whom notice is to be given.\n\nAn appropriate and often desirable procedure for a court to obtain the advice of a disinterested expert on legal issues is to invite the expert to file a brief amicus curiae.\n\nCertain ex parte communication is approved by Section 3B(7) to facilitate scheduling and other administrative purposes and to accommodate emergencies. In general, however, a judge must discourage ex parte communication and allow it only if all the criteria stated in Section 3B(7) are clearly met. A judge must disclose to all parties all ex parte communications described in Sections 3B(7)(a) and 3B(7)(b) regarding a proceeding pending or impending before the judge.\n\nCanon 3(B)(7)(e) recognizes a judge may initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications in certain circumstances; such as when serving on problem-solving courts. In this capacity, judges may assume a more interactive role with parties, treatment providers, probation officers, social workers and others as part of the problem-solving court team.\n\nA judge must not independently investigate facts in a case and must consider only the evidence presented.\n\nA judge may request a party to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, so long as the other parties are apprised of the request and are given an opportunity to respond to the proposed findings and conclusions.\n\nA judge must make reasonable efforts, including the provision of appropriate supervision, to ensure that Section 3B(7) is not violated through law clerks or other personnel on the judge's staff.\n\nIf communication between the trial judge and the appellate court with respect to a proceeding is permitted, a copy of any written communication or the substance of any oral communication should be provided to all parties.\n\n(8)A judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently and fairly and shall report promptly and accurately all undecided matters in compliance with the reporting requirements of the Supreme Court.\n\nB(8) COMMENTARY\n\nIn disposing of matters promptly, efficiently and fairly, a judge must demonstrate due regard for the rights of the parties to be heard and to have issues resolved without unnecessary cost or delay. Containing costs while preserving fundamental rights of parties also protects the interests of witnesses and the general public. A judge should monitor and supervise cases so as to reduce or eliminate dilatory practices, avoidable delays and unnecessary costs. A judge should encourage and seek to facilitate settlement, but parties should not feel coerced into surrendering the right to have their controversy resolved by the courts.\n\nPrompt disposition of the court's business requires a judge to devote adequate time to judicial duties, to be punctual in attending court and expeditious in determining matters under submission, and to insist that court officials, litigants and their lawyers cooperate with the judge to that end.\n\n(9)A judge shall not, while a proceeding is pending or impending in any court, make any public comment that might reasonably be expected to affect its outcome or impair its fairness or make any nonpublic comment that might substantially interfere with a fair trial or hearing. The judge shall require * similar abstention on the part of court personnel * subject to the judge's direction and control. This Section does not prohibit judges from making public statements in the course of their official duties or from explaining for public information the procedures of the court. This Section does not apply to proceedings in which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity. In connection with a judicial election or recall campaign, this canon does not prohibit a judge from making a public comment about a pending or past proceeding, provided (a) the comment would not reasonably be expected to affect the outcome or impair the fairness of the proceeding, and (b) the comment is about the procedural, factual, or legal basis of a decision about which a judge has been criticized during the election or recall campaign.\n\n(10)A judge shall not, with respect to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial * performance of the adjudicative duties of the office.\n\nB(9)(10) COMMENTARY\n\nSections 3B(9) and (10) restrictions on judicial speech are essential to the maintenance of the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the judiciary. A pending proceeding is one that has begun but not yet reached final disposition. An impending proceeding is one that is anticipated but not yet begun. The requirement that judges abstain from public comment regarding a pending or impending proceeding continues during any appellate process and until final disposition. Sections 3B(9) and (10) do not prohibit a judge from commenting on proceedings in which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity, but in cases such as a writ of mandamus where the judge is a litigant in an official capacity, the judge must not comment publicly. The conduct of lawyers relating to trial publicity is governed by South Dakota Rule of Professional Conduct 3.6.\n\n(11)A judge shall not commend or criticize jurors for their verdict other than in a court order or opinion in a proceeding, but may express appreciation to jurors for their service to the judicial system and the community.\n\nCommending or criticizing jurors for their verdict may imply a judicial expectation in future cases and may impair a juror's ability to be fair and impartial in a subsequent case.\n\n(12)A judge shall not disclose or use, for any purpose unrelated to judicial duties, nonpublic information * acquired in a judicial capacity.\n\n(13)With the exception of the rules for expanded media coverage of appellate court proceedings and the rules for media coverage of trial court proceedings, a judge should prohibit broadcasting, televising, recording, or taking photographs in the courtroom and areas immediately adjacent thereto during sessions of court or recess between sessions, except that a judge may authorize:\n\n(a)the use of electronic or photographic means for the presentation of evidence, for the perpetuation of a record, or for other purposes of judicial administration;\n\n(b)the broadcasting, televising, recording, or photographing of investitive, ceremonial, or naturalization proceedings;\n\n(c)the photographic or electronic recording and reproduction of appropriate court proceedings under the following conditions:\n\n(i)the means of recording will not distract participants or impair the dignity of the proceedings;\n\n(ii)the parties have consented, and the consent to being depicted or recorded has been obtained from each witness appearing in the recording and reproduction;\n\n(iii)the reproduction will not be exhibited until after the proceeding has been concluded and all direct appeals have been exhausted; and\n\n(iv)the reproduction will be exhibited only for instructional purposes in educational institutions.\n\nC. Administrative Responsibilities.\n\n(1)A judge shall diligently discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities without bias or prejudice and maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and should cooperate with other judges and court officials in the administration of court business.\n\n(2)A judge shall require * staff, court officials and others subject to the judge's direction and control to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge and to refrain from manifesting bias or prejudice in the performance of their official duties.\n\n(3)A judge with supervisory authority for the judicial performance of other judges shall take reasonable measures to assure the prompt disposition of matters before them and the proper performance of their other judicial responsibilities.\n\n(4)A judge shall not make unnecessary appointments. A judge shall exercise the power of appointment impartially and on the basis of merit. A judge shall avoid nepotism and favoritism. A judge shall not approve compensation of appointees beyond the fair value of services rendered.\n\nAppointees of a judge include assigned counsel, officials such as referees, commissioners, special masters, receivers and guardians and personnel such as clerks, secretaries and bailiffs. Consent by the parties to an appointment or an award of compensation does not relieve the judge of the obligation prescribed by Section 3C(4).\n\nD. Disciplinary Responsibilities.\n\n(1)A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood that another judge has committed a violation of this Code should take appropriate action. A judge having knowledge * that another judge has committed a violation of this Code that raises a substantial question as to the other judge's fitness for office shall inform the appropriate authority.*\n\n(2)A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood that a lawyer has committed a violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility should take appropriate action. A judge having knowledge * that a lawyer has committed a violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility that raises a substantial question as to the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects shall inform the appropriate authority.*\n\n(3) Sections 3D(1) and 3D(2) shall not apply to information obtained by a judge as a member of a committee, organization or related group established or approved by the South Dakota Judges Association, the State Bar or the Supreme Court to assist lawyers, judges or law students with a medical condition as defined in §16-19-29(1), including the name of any individual in contact with the member and sources of information or information obtained therefrom.\n\n(4) A judicial member of an entity described in Section 3D(3) shall not be required to treat as confidential, communications that cause him or her to believe a person intends or contemplates causing harm to himself, herself or a reasonably identifiable person and that disclosure of the communications to the potential victim or individuals or entities reasonably believed to be able to assist in preventing the harm is necessary.\n\n(5)Acts of a judge, in the discharge of disciplinary responsibilities, required or permitted by Sections 3D(1) and 3D(2), 3D(3) and 3D(4) are part of a judge's judicial duties and shall be absolutely privileged, and no civil action predicated thereon may be instituted against the judge.\n\nAppropriate action may include direct communication with the judge or lawyer who has committed the violation, other direct action if available, and reporting the violation to the appropriate authority or other agency or body.\n\nInformation about a lawyer's or judge's misconduct or fitness may be received by a judge in the course of that judge’s participation in an approved lawyers or judges assistance program. In that circumstance, providing for an exception to the reporting requirements of Sections 3D(1) and 3D(2) of this Rule encourages lawyers and judges to seek treatment through such a program. Conversely, without such an exception, lawyers and judges may hesitate to seek assistance from these programs, which may then result in additional harm to their professional careers and additional injury to the welfare of clients and the public.\n\nE. Disqualification.\n\n(1)A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality * might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where:\n\nE(1) COMMENTARY\n\nUnder this rule, a judge is disqualified whenever the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, regardless whether any of the specific rules in Section 3E(1) apply. For example, if a judge were in the process of negotiating for employment with a law firm, the judge would be disqualified from any matters in which that law firm appeared, unless the disqualification was waived by the parties after disclosure by the judge.\n\nA judge should disclose on the record information that the judge believes the parties or their lawyers might consider relevant to the question of disqualification, even if the judge believes there is no real basis for disqualification.\n\nBy decisional law, the rule of necessity may override the rule of disqualification. For example, a judge might be required to participate in judicial review of a judicial salary statute, or might be the only judge available in a matter requiring immediate judicial action, such as a hearing on probable cause or a temporary restraining order. In the latter case, the judge must disclose on the record the basis for possible disqualification and use reasonable efforts to transfer the matter to another judge as soon as practicable.\n\n(a)the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party's lawyer, or personal knowledge * of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;\n\n(b)the judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom the judge previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge has been a material witness concerning it.\n\nE(1)(b) COMMENTARY\n\nA lawyer in a government agency does not ordinarily have an association with other lawyers employed by that agency within the meaning of Section 3E(1)(b); a judge formerly employed by a government agency, however, should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding if the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned because of such association.\n\n(c)the judge knows * that he or she, individually or as a fiduciary,* or the judge's spouse, parent or child wherever residing, or any other member of the judge's family residing in the judge's household,* has an economic interest * in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding or has any other more than de minimis * interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;\n\n(d)the judge or the judge's spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship * to either of them or the spouse of such a person:\n\n(i)is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director or trustee of a party;\n\n(ii)is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;\n\n(iii)is known * by the judge to have a more than de minimis * interest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding, but the judge shall disclose such de minimis * interest to the parties;\n\n(iv)is to the judge's knowledge * likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.\n\nE(1)(d) COMMENTARY\n\nThe fact that a lawyer in a proceeding is affiliated with a law firm with which a relative of the judge is affiliated does not of itself disqualify the judge. Under appropriate circumstances, the fact that \"the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned\" under Section 3E(1), or that the relative is known by the judge to have an interest in the law firm that could be \"substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding\" under Section 3E(1)(d)(iii) may require the judge's disqualification.\n\n(e)the judge, while a judge or a candidate * for judicial office, has made a public statement that commits, or appears to commit, the judge with respect to:\n\n(i)an issue in the proceeding; or\n\n(ii)the controversy in the proceeding.\n\nE(1)(e) COMMENTARY\n\nCandidates for judicial office often receive questionnaires or requests for interviews from the media and from issue advocacy or other community organizations, seeking to learn their views on disputed or controversial legal or political issues. Expressing such views may require a judge's recusal or disqualification. Candidates are generally not prohibited from responding to this kind of inquiry, but candidates should proceed with caution if they choose to respond. Depending on the wording of the questions and the format provided for answering, a candidate's responses might constitute pledges, promises or commitments to perform the adjudicative duties of office other than in an impartial way. In order to avoid violating Canon 3, therefore, candidates who choose to respond should make clear their commitment to keeping an open mind while on the bench, regardless of their own personal views. If elected, such candidate shall be recused from cases where a candidate's responses constitute pledges, promises or commitments to perform the adjudicative duties of office other than in an impartial way.\n\n(2)A judge shall keep informed about the judge's personal and fiduciary * economic interests,* and make a reasonable effort to keep informed about the personal economic interests * of the judge's spouse and minor children residing in the judge's household.\n\n(3)A judge or candidate * who answers a written questionnaire seeking the judge's or candidate's * views on disputed or controversial legal or political issues shall file a copy of any response with the Clerk of the Supreme Court within ten days of the submission of the response to the questionnaire.\n\nF. Remittal of Disqualification. A judge disqualified by the terms of Section 3E may disclose on the record the basis of the judge's disqualification and may ask the parties and their lawyers to consider, out of the presence of the judge, whether to waive disqualification. If following disclosure of any basis for disqualification other than personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, the parties and lawyers, without participation by the judge, all agree that the judge should not be disqualified, and the judge is then willing to participate, the judge may participate in the proceeding. The agreement shall be incorporated in the record of the proceeding.\n\nA remittal procedure provides the parties an opportunity to proceed without delay if they wish to waive the disqualification. To assure that consideration of the question of remittal is made independently of the judge, a judge must not solicit, seek or hear comment on possible remittal or waiver of the disqualification unless the lawyers jointly propose remittal after consultation as provided in the rule. A party may act through counsel if counsel represents on the record that the party has been consulted and consents. As a practical matter, a judge may wish to have all parties and their lawyers sign the remittal agreement.\n\nSource: SL 1993, ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 93-15), eff.

Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nCANON 4 A Judge Shall So Conduct the Judge's Extra-Judicial Activities as to Minimize the Risk of Conflict With Judicial Obligations\n\nA. Extra-judicial Activities in General. A judge, subject to the proper performance of his judicial duties may engage in the following quasi-judicial activities, if in doing so he does not cast doubt on his capacity to decide impartially * any issue that may come before him. He may speak write, lecture, teach, and participate in other activities concerning the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice. A judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra-judicial activities so that they do not:\n\n(1)cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially * as a judge;\n\n(2)demean the judicial office, or\n\n(3)interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties.\n\nComplete separation of a judge from extra-judicial activities is neither possible nor wise; a judge should not become isolated from the community in which the judge lives.\n\nExpressions of bias or prejudice by a judge, even outside the judge's judicial activities, may cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge. Expressions which may do so include jokes or other remarks demeaning individuals on the basis of their race, sex, religion, national origin, disability or age. See Section 2C and accompanying Commentary.\n\nB. Avocational Activities. A judge may speak, write, lecture, teach and participate in other extra-judicial activities concerning the law,* the legal system, the administration of justice and non-legal subjects, subject to the requirements of this Code.\n\nAs a judicial officer and person specially learned in the law, a judge is in a unique position to contribute to the improvement of the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice, including revision of substantive and procedural law and improvement of criminal and juvenile justice. To the extent that time permits, a judge is encouraged to do so, either independently or through a bar association, judicial conference or other organization dedicated to the improvement of the law. Judges may participate in efforts to promote the fair administration of justice, the independence of the judiciary and the integrity of the legal profession and may express opposition to the persecution of lawyers and judges in other countries because of their professional activities.\n\nIn this and other Sections of Canon 4, the phrase \"subject to the requirements of this Code\" is used, notably in connection with a judge's governmental, civic or charitable activities. This phrase is included to remind judges that the use of permissive language in various Sections of the Code does not relieve a judge from the other requirements of the Code that apply to the specific conduct.\n\nC. Governmental, Civic or Charitable Activities.\n\n(1)A judge shall not appear at a public hearing before, or otherwise consult with, an executive or legislative body or official except on matters concerning the law,* the legal system or the administration of justice or except when acting pro se in a matter involving the judge or the judge's interests.\n\nSee Section 2B regarding the obligation to avoid improper influence.\n\n(2)A judge shall not accept appointment to a governmental committee or commission or other governmental position that is concerned with issues of fact or policy on matters other than the improvement of the law,* the legal system, or the administration of justice. A judge may, however, represent a country, state or locality on ceremonial occasions or in connection with historical, educational or cultural activities.\n\nSection 4C(2) prohibits a judge from accepting any governmental position except one relating to the law, legal system or administration of justice as authorized by Section 4C(3).\n\nThe appropriateness of accepting extra-judicial assignments must be assessed in light of the demands on judicial resources created by crowded dockets and the need to protect the courts from involvement in extra-judicial matters that may prove to be controversial. Judges should not accept governmental appointments that are likely to interfere with the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary.\n\nSection 4C(2) does not govern a judge's service in a nongovernmental position. See Section 4C(3) permitting service by a judge with organizations devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal system or the administration of justice and with educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic organizations not conducted for profit. For example, service on the board of a public educational institution, unless it were a law school, would be prohibited under Section 4C(2), but service on the board of a public law school or any private educational institution would generally be permitted under Section 4C(3).\n\n(3)A judge may serve as an officer, director, trustee or non-legal advisor of an organization or governmental agency devoted to the improvement of the law,* the legal system or the administration of justice or of an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic organization not conducted for profit, subject to the following limitations and the other requirements of this Code.\n\nSection 4C(3) does not apply to a judge's service in a governmental position unconnected with the improvement of the law, the legal system or the administration of justice, see Section 4C(2).\n\nSee Commentary to Section 4B regarding use of the phrase \"subject to the following limitations and the other requirements of this Code.\" As an example of the meaning of the phrase, a judge permitted by Section 4C(3) to serve on the board of a fraternal institution may be prohibited from such service by Sections 2C or 4A if the institution practices invidious discrimination or if service on the board otherwise casts reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge.\n\nService by a judge on behalf of a civic or charitable organization may be governed by other provisions of Canon 4 in addition to Section 4C. For example, a judge is prohibited by Section 4G from serving as a legal advisor to a civic or charitable organization.\n\n(a)A judge shall not serve as an officer, director, trustee or non-legal advisor if it is likely that the organization\n\n(i)will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the judge, or\n\n(ii)will be engaged frequently in adversary proceedings in the court of which the judge is a member or in any court subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the court of which the judge is a member.\n\nThe changing nature of some organizations and of their relationship to the law makes it necessary for a judge regularly to reexamine the activities of each organization with which the judge is affiliated to determine if it is proper for the judge to continue the affiliation.\n\nFor example, in many jurisdictions charitable hospitals are now more frequently in court than in the past. Similarly, the boards of some legal aid organizations now make policy decisions that may have political significance or imply commitment to causes that may come before the courts for adjudication.\n\n(b)A judge as an officer, director, trustee or non-legal advisor, or as a member or otherwise:\n\n(i)may assist such an organization in planning fund-raising and may participate in the management and investment of the organization's funds, but shall not personally participate in the solicitation of funds or participate in other fund-raising activities, except that a judge may solicit funds from other judges over whom the judge does not exercise supervisory or appellate authority;\n\n(ii)may make recommendations to public and private fund-granting organizations on projects and programs concerning the law,* the legal system or the administration of justice;\n\n(iii)shall not personally participate in membership solicitation if the solicitation might reasonably be perceived as coercive or, except as permitted in Section 4C(3)(b)(i), if the membership solicitation is essentially a fund-raising mechanism;\n\n(iv)shall not use or permit the use of the prestige of judicial office for fund-raising or membership solicitation.\n\nA judge may solicit membership or endorse or encourage membership efforts for an organization devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal system or the administration of justice or a nonprofit educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic organization as long as the solicitation cannot reasonably be perceived as coercive and is not essentially a fund- raising mechanism. Solicitation of funds for an organization and solicitation of memberships similarly involve the danger that the person solicited will feel obligated to respond favorably to the solicitor if the solicitor is in a position of influence or control. A judge must not engage in direct, individual solicitation of funds or memberships in person, in writing or by telephone except in the following cases: 1) a judge may solicit for funds or memberships other judges over whom the judge does not exercise supervisory or appellate authority, 2) a judge may solicit other persons for membership in the organizations described above if neither those persons nor persons with whom they are affiliated are likely ever to appear before the court on which the judge serves and 3) a judge who is an officer of such an organization may send a general membership solicitation mailing over the judge's signature.\n\nUse of an organization letterhead for fund-raising or membership solicitation does not violate Section 4C(3)(b) provided the letterhead lists only the judge's name and office or other position in the organization, and, if comparable designations are listed for other persons, the judge's judicial designation. In addition, a judge must also make reasonable efforts to ensure that the judge's staff, court officials and others subject to the judge's direction and control do not solicit funds on the judge's behalf for any purpose, charitable or otherwise.\n\nA judge must not be a speaker or guest of honor at an organization's fund-raising event, but mere attendance at such an event is permissible if otherwise consistent with this Code.\n\nD. Financial Activities.\n\n(1)A judge shall not engage in financial and business dealings that:\n\n(a)may reasonably be perceived to exploit the judge's judicial position, or\n\n(b)involve the judge in frequent transactions or continuing business relationships with those lawyers or other persons likely to come before the court on which the judge serves.\n\nThe Time for Compliance provision of this Code (Application, Section F) postpones the time for compliance with certain provisions of this Section in some cases.\n\nWhen a judge acquires in a judicial capacity information, such as material contained in filings with the court, that is not yet generally known, the judge must not use the information for private gain. See Section 2B; see also Section 3B(11).\n\nA judge must avoid financial and business dealings that involve the judge in frequent transactions or continuing business relationships with persons likely to come either before the judge personally or before other judges on the judge's court. In addition, a judge should discourage members of the judge's family from engaging in dealings that would reasonably appear to exploit the judge's judicial position.\n\nThis rule is necessary to avoid creating an appearance of exploitation of office or favoritism and to minimize the potential for disqualification. With respect to affiliation of relatives of judges with law firms appearing before the judge, see Commentary to Section 3E(1) relating to disqualification.\n\nParticipation by a judge in financial and business dealings is subject to the general prohibitions in Section 4A against activities that tend to reflect adversely on impartiality, demean the judicial office, or interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties. Such participation is also subject to the general prohibition in Canon 2 against activities involving impropriety or the appearance of impropriety and the prohibition in Section 2B against the misuse of the prestige of judicial office. In addition, a judge must maintain high standards of conduct in all of the judge's activities, as set forth in Canon 1. See Commentary for Section 4B regarding use of the phrase \"subject to the requirements of this Code.\"\n\n(2)RESERVED.\n\n(3)Subject to the requirement of subsection (1), a judge may hold and manage investments, including real estate and engage in other remunerative activity including the operation of a business.\n\n(4)A judge shall manage the judge's investments and other financial interests to minimize the number of cases in which the judge is disqualified. As soon as the judge can do so without serious financial detriment, the judge shall divest himself or herself of investments and other financial interests that might require frequent disqualification.\n\n(5)A judge shall not accept, and shall urge members of the judge's family residing in the judge's household * not to accept a gift, bequest, favor or loan from anyone except for:\n\nSection 4D(5) does not apply to contributions to a judge's campaign for judicial office, a matter governed by Canon 5.\n\nBecause a gift, bequest, favor or loan to a member of the judge's family residing in the judge's household might be viewed as intended to influence the judge, a judge must inform those family members of the relevant ethical constraints upon the judge in this regard and discourage those family members from violating them. A judge cannot, however, reasonably be expected to know or control all of the financial or business activities of all family members residing in the judge's household.\n\n(a)a gift incident to a public testimonial, books, tapes and other resource materials supplied by publishers on a complimentary basis for official use, or an invitation to the judge and the judge's spouse or guest to attend a bar-related function or an activity devoted to the improvement of the law,* the legal system or the administration of justice;\n\nAcceptance of an invitation to a law-related function is governed by Section 4D(5)(a); acceptance of an invitation paid for by an individual lawyer or group of lawyers is governed by Section 4D(5)(h).\n\nA judge may accept a public testimonial or a gift incident thereto only if the donor organization is not an organization whose members comprise or frequently represent the same side in litigation, and the testimonial and gift are otherwise in compliance with other provisions of this Code. See Sections 4A(1) and 2B.\n\n(b)a gift, award or benefit incident to the business, profession or other separate activity of a spouse or other family member of a judge residing in the judge's household, including gifts, awards and benefits for the use of both the spouse or other family member and the judge (as spouse or family member), provided the gift, award or benefit could not reasonably be perceived as intended to influence the judge in the performance of judicial duties;\n\n(c)ordinary social hospitality;\n\n(d)a gift from a relative or friend, for a special occasion, such as a wedding, anniversary or birthday, if the gift is fairly commensurate with the occasion and the relationship;\n\nA gift to a judge, or to a member of the judge's family living in the judge's household, that is excessive in value raises questions about the judge's impartiality and the integrity of the judicial office and might require disqualification of the judge where disqualification would not otherwise be required. See, however, Section 4D(5)(e).\n\n(e)a gift, bequest, favor or loan from a relative or close personal friend whose appearance or interest in a case would in any event require disqualification under Section 3E;\n\n(f)a loan from a lending institution in its regular course of business on the same terms generally available to persons who are not judges;\n\n(g)a scholarship or fellowship awarded on the same terms and based on the same criteria applied to other applicants or\n\n(h)any other gift, bequest, favor or loan, only if: the donor is not a party or other person who has come or is likely to come or whose interests have come or are likely to come before the judge; and, if its value exceeds $150.00, the judge reports it in the same manner as the judge reports compensation in Section 4H.\n\nSection 4D(5)(h) prohibits judges from accepting gifts, favors, bequests or loans from lawyers or their firms if they have come or are likely to come before the judge; it also prohibits gifts, favors, bequests or loans from clients of lawyers or their firms when the clients' interests have come or are likely to come before the judge.\n\nE. Fiduciary Activities.\n\n(1)Unless specifically approved by the Supreme Court, a judge shall not serve as executor, administrator or other personal representative, trustee, guardian, attorney in fact or other fiduciary,* except for the estate, trust or person of a member of the judge's family,* and then only if such service will not interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties.\n\n(2)A judge shall not serve as a fiduciary * if it is likely that the judge as a fiduciary will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the judge, or if the estate, trust, or ward becomes involved in adversary proceedings in the court on which the judge serves or one under its appellate jurisdiction.\n\n(3)The same restrictions on financial activities that apply to a judge personally also apply to the judge while acting in a fiduciary * capacity.\n\nThe Time for Compliance provision of this Code (Application, Section F) postpones the time for compliance with certain provisions of this Section in some cases.\n\nThe restrictions imposed by this Canon may conflict with the judge's obligation as a fiduciary. For example, a judge should resign as trustee if detriment to the trust would result from divestiture of holdings the retention of which would place the judge in violation of Section 4D(4).\n\nF. Service as Arbitrator or Mediator. A judge shall not act as an arbitrator or mediator or otherwise perform judicial functions in a private capacity unless expressly authorized by law.*\n\nSection 4F does not prohibit a judge from participating in arbitration, mediation or settlement conferences performed as part of judicial duties.\n\nG. Practice of Law. A judge shall not practice law. Notwithstanding this prohibition, a judge may act pro se and may, without compensation, give legal advice to and draft or review documents for a member of the judge's family.*\n\nThis prohibition refers to the practice of law in a representative capacity and not in a pro se capacity. A judge may act for himself or herself in all legal matters, including matters involving litigation and matters involving appearances before or other dealings with legislative and other governmental bodies. However, in so doing, a judge must not abuse the prestige of office to advance the interests of the judge or the judge's family. See Section 2(B).\n\nThe Code allows a judge to give legal advice to and draft legal documents for members of the judge's family, so long as the judge receives no compensation. A judge must not, however, act as an advocate or negotiator for a member of the judge's family in a legal matter.\n\nH. Compensation, Reimbursement and Reporting.\n\n(1)Compensation and Reimbursement. A judge may receive compensation and reimbursement of expenses for the quasi-judicial and extra-judicial activities permitted by this Code, if the source of such payments does not give the appearance of influencing the judge in his judge's performance of judicial duties or otherwise give the appearance of impropriety, subject to the following restrictions:\n\n(a)Compensation shall not exceed a reasonable amount nor shall it exceed what a person who is not a judge would receive for the same activity.\n\n(b)Expense reimbursement shall be limited to the actual cost of travel, food, and lodging reasonably incurred by the judge and, where appropriate to the occasion, by the judge's spouse or guest. Any payment in excess of such an amount is compensation.\n\n(2)Public Reports. A judge shall report the date, place and nature of any activity for which the judge received compensation, and the name of the payor and the amount of compensation so received. Compensation or income of a spouse attributed to the judge by operation of a community property law is not extra-judicial compensation to the judge. The judge's report shall be made at least annually and shall be filed as a public document in the office of the Clerk of the South Dakota Supreme Court.\n\nSee Section 4D(5) regarding reporting of gifts, bequests and loans.\n\nThe Code does not prohibit a judge from accepting honoraria or speaking fees provided that the compensation is reasonable and commensurate with the task performed. A judge should ensure, however, that no conflicts are created by the arrangement. A judge must not appear to trade on the judicial position for personal advantage. Nor should a judge spend significant time away from court duties to meet speaking or writing commitments for compensation. In addition, the source of the payment must not raise any question of undue influence or the judge's ability or willingness to be impartial.\n\nI. Disclosure of a judge's income, debts, investments or other assets. Disclosure of a judge's income, debts, investments or other assets is required only to the extent provided in this Canon and in Sections 3E and 3F, or as otherwise required by law.*\n\nSection 3E requires a judge to disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge has an economic interest. See \"economic interest\" as explained in the Terminology Section. Section 4D requires a judge to refrain from engaging in business and from financial activities that might interfere with the impartial performance of his judicial duties; Section 4H requires a judge to report all compensation the judge received for activities outside judicial office. A judge has the rights of any other citizen, including the right to privacy of the judge's financial affairs, except to the extent that limitations established by law are required to safeguard the proper performance of the judge's duties.\n\nSource: SL 1993, ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 93-15), eff.

All Judges and Candidates\n\n(1)Except as authorized in Sections 5B(2), 5C(1), 5C(2) and 5C(3), a judge or a candidate * for election or appointment to judicial office shall not:\n\n(a)hold an office in a political organization;*\n\n(b)publicly endorse or publicly oppose another candidate for public office;\n\n(c)make speeches on behalf of a political organization;*\n\n(d)solicit funds for a political organization * or candidate;* or\n\n(e)personally solicit or accept campaign contributions other than through a campaign committee authorized by Section 5C(2).\n\nWhere false information concerning a judicial candidate is made public, a judge or another judicial candidate having knowledge of the facts is not prohibited by Section 5A(1) from making the facts public.\n\nSection 5A(1)(a) does not prohibit a candidate for elective judicial office from retaining during candidacy a public office such as county prosecutor, which is not Aan office in a political organization.\n\nSection 5A(1)(b) does not prohibit a judge or judicial candidate from privately expressing his or her views on judicial candidates or other candidates for public office.\n\nA candidate does not publicly endorse another candidate for public office by having that candidate's name on the same ticket.\n\n(2)A judge shall resign from judicial office upon becoming a candidate * for a nonjudicial office either in a primary or in a general election, except that the judge may continue to hold judicial office while being a candidate * for election to or serving as a delegate in a state constitutional convention if the judge is otherwise permitted by law * to do so.\n\nThis section applies regardless of whether the office sought is partisan or nonpartisan.\n\n(3)A candidate * for a judicial office:\n\n(a)shall maintain the dignity appropriate to judicial office and act in a manner consistent with the integrity, impartiality,* and independence of the judiciary, and shall encourage members of the candidate's family * to adhere to the same standards of political conduct in support of the candidate * as apply to candidate;*\n\nAlthough a judicial candidate must encourage members of his or her family to adhere to the same standards of political conduct in support of the candidate that apply to the candidate, family\n\nmembers are free to participate in other political activity.\n\n(b)shall prohibit employees and officials who serve at the pleasure of the candidate,* and shall discourage other employees and officials subject to the candidate's direction and control from doing on the candidate's behalf what the candidate * is prohibited from doing under the Sections of this Canon;\n\n(c)except to the extent permitted by Section 5C(2), shall not authorize or knowingly * permit any other person to do for the candidate what the candidate * is prohibited from doing under the Sections of this Canon;\n\n(d)shall not:\n\n(i)with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial * performance of the adjudicative duties of the office; or\n\n(ii)knowingly * misrepresent the identity, qualifications, present position or other fact concerning the candidate * or an opponent;\n\nSection 5A(3)(d) prohibits a candidate for judicial office from making pledges, promises or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the\n\noffice regarding cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court. A candidate should emphasize in any public statement the candidate=s duty to uphold the law regardless of his or her personal views. See also Sections 3B(9) and (10), the general rules on public comment by\n\njudges. Section 5A(3)(d) does not prohibit a candidate from making pledges or promises respecting court administration. Nor does this Section prohibit an incumbent judge from making private statements to other judges or court personnel in the performance of judicial duties. This Section applies to any statement made in the process of securing judicial office, such as statements to commissions charged with judicial selection and tenure and legislative bodies confirming appointment. See also South Dakota Rule of Professional Conduct 8.2. The promises and commitments clause must be narrowly construed and cautiously applied to campaign speech.\n\n(e)may respond to personal attacks or attacks on the candidate's record as long as the response does not violate Section 5A(3)(d).\n\nB. Candidates Seeking Appointment to Judicial or Other Governmental Office.\n\n(1)A candidate * for appointment to judicial office or a judge seeking other governmental office shall not solicit or accept funds, personally or through a committee or otherwise, to support his or her candidacy.\n\n(2)A candidate * for appointment to judicial office or a judge seeking other governmental office shall not engage in any political activity to secure the appointment except that:\n\n(a)such persons may, unless otherwise prohibited by law:*\n\n(i)communicate with the appointing authority, including any selection or nominating commission or other agency designated to screen candidates;\n\n(ii)seek support or endorsement for the appointment from organizations that regularly make recommendations for reappointment or appointment to the office and from individuals to the extent requested or required by those specified in Section 5B(2)(a); and\n\n(iii)provide to those specified in Sections 5B(2)(a)(i) and 5B(2)(a)(ii) information as to his or her qualifications for the office.\n\n(b)a nonjudge candidate * for appointment to judicial office may, in addition, unless otherwise prohibited by law:*\n\n(i)retain an office in a political organization,*\n\n(ii)attend political gatherings, and\n\n(iii)continue to pay ordinary assessments and ordinary contributions to a political organization * or candidate and purchase tickets for political party dinners or other functions.\n\nSection 5B(2) provides a limited exception to the restrictions imposed by Sections 5A(1) and 5D. Under Section 5B(2), candidates seeking reappointment to the same judicial office or appointment\n\nto another judicial office or other governmental office may apply for the appointment and seek appropriate support.\n\nAlthough under Section 5B(2) nonjudge candidates seeking appointment to judicial office are permitted during candidacy to retain office in a political organization, attend political gatherings and pay ordinary dues and assessments, they remain subject to other provisions of this Code during candidacy. See Sections 5B(1), 5B(2)(a), 5E and Application Section.\n\nC. Judges and Candidates Subject to Public Election.\n\n(1)A judge or a candidate * subject to public election * may, except as provided by law:*\n\n(a)at any time\n\n(i)purchase tickets for and attend political gatherings:\n\n(ii)identify himself or herself as a member of a political party;\n\n(iii)contribute to a political organization * or candidate and,\n\n(iv)speak to gatherings on his or her own behalf;\n\n(b)when a candidate for election\n\n(i)appear in newspaper, television and other media advertisements supporting his or her candidacy:\n\n(ii)distribute pamphlets and other promotional campaign literature supporting his or her candidacy;\n\n(iii)publicly endorse or publicly oppose other candidates for the same judicial office in a public election in which the judge or judicial candidate is running;\n\n(iv)establish a campaign committee pursuant to the provisions of Section 5C(2); and\n\n(v)seek, accept, or use endorsements from any person or organization.\n\nSection 5C(1) permits judges subject to election to be involved in certain political activity. Section 5D, applicable solely to incumbent judges, would otherwise bar this activity. The conduct of a judicial campaign and the manner of presentation of any material in connection with a campaign for judicial office should comport with the dignity and integrity required of that office.\n\n(2)A judicial candidate subject to public election\n\n(a)may establish a campaign committee to manage and conduct a campaign for the candidate, subject to the provisions of this Code. The candidate is responsible for ensuring that his or her campaign committee complies with applicable provisions of this Code and other applicable law.\n\n(b)A judicial candidate subject to public election shall direct his or her campaign committee:\n\n(i)to solicit and accept only such campaign contributions as are reasonable, in any event not to exceed one-thousand dollars ($1,000) in the election year per individual or organization;\n\n(ii)not to solicit contributions for the candidates campaign earlier than January 1 of the election year and no later than December 31 of the election year;\n\n(iii)that in addition to complying with all applicable statutory requirements for disclosure of campaign contributions, candidates * or candidates' campaign committees shall comply with all applicable statutory campaign reporting requirements;\n\n(iv)not to use or permit the use of campaign contributions for the private benefit of the candidate * or others; and\n\n(v)not to disclose to the candidate the identity of campaign contributors nor to disclose to the candidate the identity of those who were solicited for contribution and refused such solicitation. The candidate may be advised of aggregate contribution information in a manner that does not reveal the source(s) of the contributions.\n\n(c)A judicial candidate subject to public election may personally solicit campaign contributions from members of the judge's family, from a person with whom the judge has an intimate relationship, or from judges over whom the judge does not exercise supervisory or appellate authority.\n\nJudicial candidates are prohibited from personally soliciting campaign contributions or personally accepting campaign contributions except to the extent allowed by Section 5C(2)(c). See Section 5A(1)(e). Campaign committees may solicit and accept campaign contributions, manage the expenditure of campaign funds, and generally conduct campaigns. Candidates are responsible for compliance with the requirements of election law and other applicable law, and for the activities of their campaign committees. For instance, under current law candidates should advise their campaign committee to follow the reporting requirements contained in SDCL §12-27-22 and SDCL 12-27-24 thru 28. Such reports must be filed with the Secretary of State on the dates specified. The candidates* or candidates= campaign committees shall also comply with SDCL §12-27-15. At the start of a campaign, the candidate must instruct the campaign committee to solicit or accept only such contributions as are reasonable in amount, appropriate under the circumstances, but not to exceed one-thousand dollars in the election year per individual or organization. The candidate must also instruct the campaign committee to comply with all applicable requirements of Section 5C(2).\n\nCandidates= campaign committees established under Section 5C(2) should manage campaign finances responsibly, avoiding deficits that might necessitate post-election fund-raising, to the extent possible. Contributions for a campaign for judicial office should not be knowingly solicited or accepted from a party, or one employed by, affiliated with or a member of the immediate family of a party, to litigation that (a) is before the candidate, (b) may reasonably be expected to come before the candidate if elected, or (c) has come before the candidate so recently that the knowing solicitation or acceptance of funds may give the appearance of improper use of the power or prestige of judicial office. Similarly, contributions may not be knowingly solicited or accepted from any firm, corporation or other organization that has as one of its purposes the promotion of one side of a legal issue which may reasonably be expected to come before the candidate if elected. Contributions may be solicited and accepted from lawyers (including lawyers having cases before, or which may come before, the candidate), provided that the solicitation makes no reference, direct or indirect, to any particular pending or potential litigation.\n\n(3)Except as prohibited by law,* a candidate * for judicial office in a public election may permit the candidate's * name:\n\n(a)to be listed on election materials along with the names of other candidates * for elective public office, and\n\n(b)to appear in promotions of his or her candidacy.\n\nSection 5C(3) provides a limited exception to the restrictions imposed by Section 5A(1).\n\nD. Incumbent Judges. A judge shall not engage in any political activity except (i) as authorized under any other Section of this Code, (ii) on behalf of measures to improve the law,* the legal system or the administration of justice, or (iii) as expressly authorized by law.\n\nNeither Section 5D nor any other Section of the Code prohibits a judge in the exercise of administrative functions from engaging in planning and other official activities with members of the executive and legislative branches of government. With respect to a judge's activity on behalf of measures to improve the law, the legal system and the administration of justice, see Commentary to Section 4B and Section 4C(1) and its Commentary.\n\nE. Applicability. Canon 5 generally applies to all incumbent judges and judicial candidates.* A successful candidate,* whether or not an incumbent, is subject to judicial discipline for his or her campaign conduct; an unsuccessful candidate * who is a lawyer is subject to lawyer discipline for his or her campaign conduct. A lawyer who is a candidate * for judicial office is subject to Rule 8.2(b) of the South Dakota Model Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nSource: SL 1993, ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 93-15), eff.

July 1, 2013.\n\nAPPLICATION OF THE CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT\n\nA. Application of code. Anyone, whether or not a lawyer, who is an officer of a judicial system magistrate, special master or referee, is a judge within the meaning of this Code. All judges shall comply with this Code except as provided below.\n\nThe three categories of judicial service in other than a full-time capacity are necessarily defined in general terms because of the widely varying forms of judicial service. For the purposes of this Section, as long as a retired judge is subject to recall the judge is considered to \"perform judicial functions.\" The determination of which category and, accordingly, which specific Code provisions apply to an individual judicial officer, depend upon the facts of the particular judicial service.\n\nB. RESERVED.\n\nC. Continuing Part-time Judge. A continuing part-time judge *:\n\n(1)is not required to comply\n\n(a)except while serving as a judge, with Section 3B(9); and\n\n(b)at any time with Sections 4C(2), 4E(1), 4F, 4G, 4H, 5A(1), 5B(2) and 5D.\n\n(2)shall not act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto.\n\nWhen a person who has been a continuing part-time judge is no longer a continuing part-time judge, including a retired judge no longer subject to recall, that person may act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which he or she has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto only with the express consent of all parties pursuant to Rule 1.12(a) of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nD. Periodic Part-time Judge. A periodic part-time judge *:\n\n(1)is not required to comply\n\n(a)except while serving as a judge, with Sections 2A and 3B(9);\n\n(b)at any time, with Sections 4C(1), 4C(2), 4C(3)(a) and (b), 4D(1)(b), 4D(4), 4D(5), 4E 4F, 4G, 4H, 5A(1), 5A(2), 5B(2) and 5D.\n\n(2)shall not act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto.\n\nWhen a person who has been a periodic part-time judge is no longer a periodic part-time judge (no longer accepts appointments), that person may act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which he or she has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto only with the express consent of all parties pursuant to Rule 1.12(a) of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nE. Pro Tempore Part-time Judge. A pro tempore part-time judge *:\n\n(1)is not required to comply\n\n(a)except while serving as a judge, with Sections 2A, 2B and 3B(9);\n\n(b)at any time with Sections 2C, 4C(1), 4C(2), 4C(3)(a), 4C(3)(b), 4D(1)(b), 4D(4), 4D(5), 4E, 4F, 4G, 4H, 5A(1), 5A(2), 5B(2) and 5D\n\n(2)A person who has been a pro tempore part-time judge * shall not act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto except as otherwise permitted by Rule 1.12(a) of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nF. Time for Compliance. A person to whom this Code becomes applicable shall comply immediately with all provisions of this Code except Sections 4D(2) and 4E and shall comply with these Sections as soon as reasonably possible and shall do so in any event within the period of one year.\n\nIf serving as a fiduciary when selected as judge, a new judge may, notwithstanding the prohibitions in Section 4E, continue to serve as fiduciary but only for that period of time necessary to avoid serious adverse consequences to the beneficiary of the fiduciary relationship and in no event longer than one year. Similarly, if engaged at the time of judicial selection in a business activity, a new judge may, notwithstanding the prohibitions in Section 4D(3), continue in that activity for a reasonable period but in no event longer than one year.\n\nSource: SL 1993, ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 93-15), eff.

Interpreters help ensure that such persons may enjoy equal access to justice and that court proceedings and court support services function efficiently and effectively.
