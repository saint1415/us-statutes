Uniform Emergency Management Assistance Compact.\n\nThe Uniform Emergency Management Assistance Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by the State of South Dakota with all other states legally joining the compact, in the form substantially as follows:\n\nARTICLE I--PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIES\n\nThis compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term \"states\" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.\n\nThe purpose of this compact is to provide the mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.\n\nThis compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.\n\nARTICLE II--GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION\n\nEach party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies of the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist. The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.\n\nOn behalf of the Governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.\n\nARTICLE III--PARTY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nA. It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:\n\ni.Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.\n\nii.Review party states individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency.\n\niii.Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans.\n\niv.Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries.\n\nv.Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material.vi.Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.vii.Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.B. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:i.A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue.ii.The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.iii.The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.C. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.ARTICLE IV--LIMITATIONSAny party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the Governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer.ARTICLE V--LICENSES AND PERMITSWhenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the Governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.ARTICLE VI--LIABILITYOfficers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.ARTICLE VII--SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTSInasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.ARTICLE VIII--COMPENSATIONEach party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.ARTICLE IX--REIMBURSEMENTAny party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided, that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further, that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses may not be reimbursable under this provision.ARTICLE X--EVACUATIONPlans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.ARTICLE XI--IMPLEMENTATIONA. This compact shall become operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states; thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment by such state.B. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until thirty days after the Governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.

State and Province Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of Understanding.\n\nThe State and Province Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of Understanding is hereby enacted into law and entered into by the State of South Dakota with all other states legally joining the agreement, in the form substantially as follows:\n\nARTICLE I -- PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIES\n\nThe State and Province Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of Understanding, hereinafter referred to as the compact, is made and entered into by and among such of the jurisdictions as shall enact or adopt this compact, hereinafter referred to as participating jurisdictions. For the purposes of this compact, the term, jurisdictions, may include any or all of the states of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, New York, and Wisconsin, and the Canadian Provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan, and such other states and provinces as may hereafter become a party to this compact. The term, states, means the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all territorial possessions of the United States. The term, province, means the ten political units of government within Canada.\n\nThe purpose of this compact is to provide for the possibility of mutual assistance among the participating jurisdictions in managing any emergency or disaster when the affected jurisdiction or jurisdictions ask for assistance, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, manmade disaster, or civil emergency aspects of resource shortages. This compact also provides for the process of planning mechanisms among the agencies responsible and for mutual cooperation, including civil emergency preparedness exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by participating jurisdictions or subdivisions of participating jurisdictions during emergencies, with such actions occurring outside emergency periods.\n\nARTICLE II -- GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION\n\nEach participating jurisdiction entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies may exceed the capabilities of a participating jurisdiction and that inter-governmental cooperation is essential in such circumstances. Each participating jurisdiction further recognizes that there will be emergencies that may require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency because few, if any, individual jurisdictions have all the resources they need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist. On behalf of the participating jurisdictions in the compact, the legally designated official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management is responsible for formulation of the appropriate inter-jurisdictional mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact, and for recommendations to the participating jurisdiction concerned with respect to the amendment of any statutes, regulations, or ordinances required for that purpose.\n\nARTICLE III -- PARTICIPATING JURISDICTION RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n(a) FORMULATE PLANS AND PROGRAMS -- It is the responsibility of each participating jurisdiction to formulate procedural plans and programs for inter-jurisdictional cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this section. In formulating and implementing such plans and programs the participating jurisdictions, to the extent practical, may:\n\n(1)Share and review individual jurisdiction hazards analyses that are available and determine all those potential emergencies the participating jurisdictions might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster or emergency aspects of resource shortages;\n\n(2)Share emergency operations plans, procedures, and protocols established by each of the participating jurisdictions before entering into this compact;\n\n(3)Share policies and procedures for resource mobilization, tracking, demobilization, and reimbursement;\n\n(4)Consider joint planning, training, and exercises;(5)Assist with alerts, notifications, and warnings for communities adjacent to or crossing participating jurisdiction boundaries;(6)Consider procedures to facilitate the movement of evacuees, refugees, civil emergency personnel, equipment, or other resources into or across boundaries, or to a designated staging area when it is agreed that such movement or staging will facilitate civil emergency operations by the affected or participating jurisdictions; and(7)Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that impede the implementation of responsibilities described in this section.(b) REQUEST ASSISTANCE -- The authorized representative of a participating jurisdiction may request assistance of another participating jurisdiction by contacting the authorized representative of that jurisdiction.

If verbal, the request must be confirmed in writing within fifteen days of the verbal request. Requests must provide the following information:(1)A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed and of the mission or missions, including fire services, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue;(2)The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials, and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed; and(3)The specific place and time for staging of the assisting participating jurisdiction's response and a point of contact at the location.(c) CONSULTATION AMONG PARTICIPATING JURISDICTION OFFICIALS -- There shall be periodic consultation among the authorized representatives who have assigned emergency management responsibilities.ARTICLE IV -- LIMITATIONIt is recognized that any participating jurisdiction that agrees to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid will respond as soon as possible. It is also recognized that the participating jurisdiction rendering aid may withhold or recall resources to provide reasonable protection for itself, at its discretion. To the extent authorized by law, each participating jurisdiction will afford to the personnel of the emergency contingent of any other participating jurisdiction while operating within its jurisdiction limits under the terms and conditions of this agreement and under the operational control of an officer of the requesting participating jurisdiction the same treatment as is afforded similar or like human resources of the participating jurisdiction in which they are performing emergency services. Staff comprising the emergency contingent continue under the command and control of their regular leaders but the organizational units come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the participating jurisdiction receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, by the participating jurisdiction that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and continue as long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving participating jurisdictions, whichever is longer. The receiving participating jurisdiction is responsible for informing the assisting participating jurisdiction when services will no longer be required.ARTICLE V -- LICENSES AND PERMITSWhenever a person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any participating jurisdiction evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving participating jurisdiction, such person is deemed to be licensed, certified, or permitted by the jurisdiction requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet an emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the requesting jurisdiction prescribes by executive order or otherwise.ARTICLE VI -- LIABILITYAny person or entity of a participating jurisdiction rendering aid in another jurisdiction pursuant to this compact is considered an agent of the requesting jurisdiction for tort liability and immunity purposes.

An aiding participating jurisdiction may assume in whole or in part any such loss, damage, expense, or other cost or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving participating jurisdiction without charge or cost. Any two or more participating jurisdictions may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those jurisdictions. Expenses under Article VIII are not reimbursable under this section.ARTICLE X -- IMPLEMENTATION(a) This compact is effective upon its execution or adoption by any one state and one province, and is effective as to any other jurisdiction upon its execution or adoption thereby: subject to approval or authorization by the United States Congress, if required, and subject to enactment of provincial or state legislation that may be required for the effectiveness of the memorandum of understanding.(b) Additional jurisdictions may participate in this compact upon execution or adoption of the compact.(c) Any participating jurisdiction may withdraw from this compact, but the withdrawal does not take effect until thirty days after the governor or premier of the withdrawing jurisdiction has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors or premiers of all other participating jurisdictions.
