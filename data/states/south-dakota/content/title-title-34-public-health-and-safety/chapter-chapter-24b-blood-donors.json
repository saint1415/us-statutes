Blood recipients allowed to specify donors--Screening--Liability.\n\nAny person requiring a transfusion of whole blood or blood components may specify a donor or donors to provide the blood. Blood from such donors shall undergo the same screening procedures for acceptability for donation and transfusion as are medically necessary or required for blood donations of nonspecified donors. If no specified donor is able to donate blood or if it is not possible for the blood from a specified donor to be processed within the time determined by a physician to be necessary to sustain life, the physician, hospital, blood bank, or blood collection center or their officers, directors, agents, or employees are not liable solely because whole blood or blood components from nonspecified donors is subsequently transfused.\n\nSource:SL 1987, ch 256.",
