Southwestern Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact.\n\nThe Legislature of the State of South Dakota hereby enacts and ratifies the agreement set forth in this section and designates this compact as the \"Southwestern Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact,\" which is entered into pursuant to the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §§2021b to 2021d, inclusive. This compact shall become effective in accordance with article 7 of the compact as set forth in this section.\n\nThe provisions of the southwestern low-level radioactive waste disposal compact are as follows:\n\nARTICLE 1. COMPACT POLICY AND FORMATION\n\nThe party states hereby find and declare all of the following:\n\n(A)The United States Congress, by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, Public Law 96-573, as amended by the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (42 U.S.C. §§2021b to 2021j, inclusive), has encouraged the use of interstate compacts to provide for the establishment and operation of facilities for regional management of low-level radioactive waste.\n\n(B)It is the purpose of this compact to provide the means for such a cooperative effort between or among party states to protect the citizens of the states and the states' environments.\n\n(C)It is the policy of party states to this compact to encourage the reduction of the volume of low-level radioactive waste requiring disposal within the compact region.\n\n(D)It is the policy of the party states that the protection of the health and safety of their citizens and the most ecological and economical management of low-level radioactive wastes can be accomplished through cooperation of the states by minimizing the amount of handling and transportation required to dispose of these wastes and by providing facilities that serve the compact design.\n\n(E)Each party state, if an agreement state pursuant to §2021 of title 42 of the United States Code, or the nuclear regulatory commission if not an agreement state, is responsible for the primary regulation of radioactive materials within its jurisdiction.\n\nARTICLE 2.

Appropriate actions may include, but are not limited to, requiring that a bond be posted by the violator to pay the cost of repackaging at the regional disposal facility and prohibit future shipments to the regional disposal facility.(4)Each party state shall maintain a registry of all generators within the state that may have low-level radioactive waste to be disposed of at a regional disposal facility, including, but not limited to, the amount of low-level radioactive waste and the class of low-level radioactive waste generated by each generator.(5)Each party state shall encourage generators within its borders to minimize the volume of low-level radioactive waste requiring disposal.(6)Each party state may rely on the good faith performance of the other party states to perform those acts which are required by this compact to provide regional disposal facilities, including the use of the regional disposal facilities in a manner consistent with this compact.(7)Each party state shall provide the commission with any data and information necessary for the implementation of the commission's responsibilities, including taking those actions necessary to obtain this data or information.(8)Each party state shall agree that only low-level radioactive waste generated within the jurisdiction of the party states shall be disposed of in the regional disposal facility, except as provided in paragraph (19) of subdivision (G) of article 3 of this compact.(9)Each party state shall agree that if there is any injury to persons or property resulting from the operation of a regional disposal facility, the damages resulting from the injury may be paid from the third-party liability fund pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (G) of article 3 of this compact, only to the extent that the damages exceed the limits of liability insurance carried by the operator. No party state, by joining this compact, assumes any liability resulting from the siting, operation, maintenance, long-term care, or other activity relating to a regional facility, and no party state shall be liable for any harm or damage resulting from a regional facility not located within the state.ARTICLE 5. APPROVAL OF REGIONAL FACILITIESA regional disposal facility shall be approved by the host state in accordance with its laws. This compact does not confer any authority on the commission regarding the siting, design, development, licensure, or other regulation, or the operation, closure, decommissioning, or long-term care of, any regional disposal facility within a party state.ARTICLE 6. PROHIBITED ACTS AND PENALTIES(A) No person shall dispose of low-level radioactive waste within the region unless the disposal is at a regional disposal facility, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (20) and (21) of subdivision (G) of article 3 of this compact.(B) No person shall dispose of or manage any low-level radioactive waste within the region unless the low-level radioactive waste was generated within the region, except as provided in paragraphs (19), (20), and (21) of subdivision (G) of article 3 of this compact.(C) Violations of this section shall be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency within the party state's jurisdiction.(D) Violations of this section may result in prohibiting the violator from disposing of low-level radioactive waste in the regional disposal facility, as determined by the commission or the host state.ARTICLE 7.

The host state may establish all terms and conditions for the entry of any state, other than the states named in this subparagraph, as a member of this compact.(B) Upon compliance with the other provisions of this compact, an eligible state may become a party state by legislative enactment of this compact or by executive order of the governor of the state adopting this compact. A state becoming a party state by executive order shall cease to be a party state upon adjournment of the first general session of its legislature convened after the executive order is issued, unless before the adjournment the legislature enacts this compact.(C) A party state, other than the host state, may withdraw from the compact by repealing the enactment of this compact, but this withdrawal shall not become effective until two years after the effective date of the repealing legislation. If a party state which is a major generator of low-level radioactive waste voluntarily withdraws from the compact pursuant to this subdivision, that state shall make arrangements for the disposal of the other party states' low-level radioactive waste for a time period equal the period of time it was a member of this compact.If the host state withdraws from the compact, the withdrawal shall not become effective until five years after the effective date of the repealing legislation.(D) A party state may be excluded from this compact by a two-thirds vote of the commission members, acting in a meeting, if the state to be excluded has failed to carry out any obligations required by compact.(E) This compact shall take effect upon the enactment by statute by the legislature of the state of California and at least one other eligible state and upon the consent of congress and shall remain in effect until otherwise provided by federal law.
