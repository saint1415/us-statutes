The department shall cross-reference the state's records at least once each calendar year to ensure that any pregnancy help center already on the registry of pregnancy help centers has not been licensed to place children for adoption or licensed to perform abortions. If a pregnancy help center on the registry is so licensed, the department shall remove that pregnancy help center from the registry. Each year, commencing in 2015, each pregnancy help center listed on the state registry maintained by the department shall, by January twentieth, provide the department with a list of licensed persons who may provide the counseling at the pregnancy help center in compliance with §§34-23A-58.1, 34-23A-58.2, and 34-23A-58.3. If a pregnancy help center fails to provide such list by January twentieth in any particular year, the department shall issue a notice to the pregnancy help center that if it fails to provide such list of licensed persons within ninety days of the receipt of such notice, the department will remove the pregnancy help center from the registry of pregnancy help centers authorized to provide the counseling required by §§34-23A-53 to 34-23A-61, inclusive, and described under §34-23A-59. The department shall cross-reference the state's records to confirm that the licensed persons listed by the pregnancy help center maintain a current license. The department may inquire of any licensed persons listed by a registered pregnancy help center to confirm that they are available for the counseling required by the law. If the department determines that a pregnancy help center on the registry does not have a person currently licensed to provide the required counseling, the department shall notify the pregnancy help center of that determination and if the pregnancy help center cannot demonstrate that it has a licensed person to provide the counseling consistent with the law, the department shall remove the pregnancy help center from the registry. If a pregnancy help center is removed by the department from its registry pursuant to this section, the department shall inform all physicians, facilities, and entities to whom the department provides a copy of the registry of pregnancy help centers that the pregnancy help center is removed.\n\nSource:SL 2014, ch 167, §3.",

Pregnancy help center consultations.\n\nA pregnancy help center consultation required by §§34-23A-53 to 34-23A-59.2, inclusive, shall be implemented as follows:\n\n(1)The pregnancy help center shall be permitted to:\n\n(a)Interview the pregnant mother to determine whether the pregnant mother has been subject to any coercion to have an abortion, or is being pressured into having an abortion;\n\n(b)Provide counseling in connection with any coercion or pressure;\n\n(c)Inform the pregnant mother in writing or orally, or both, of the counseling, education, and assistance available to the pregnant mother to assist her in maintaining her relationship with her unborn child and in caring for the child through the pregnancy help center or any other organization, faith-based program, or governmental program;\n\n(d)Provide a statement orally and in writing to the pregnant mother that \"an abortion will terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being,\" and provide counseling in lay terms that explain this disclosure, and to ascertain that the pregnant mother understands this disclosure, and for the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of human being found in subdivision 34-23A-1(4) applies; and\n\n(e)Provide statements orally and in writing setting forth the disclosures required by subsections 34-23A-10.1(1)(c) and (d) and provide counseling in lay terms that explain those disclosures.

However, if, during the mandatory pregnancy help center consultation interview, the pregnant mother requests the opportunity to discuss the risks of an abortion with pregnancy help center personnel, the pregnancy help center may schedule a separate and distinct appointment for the pregnant mother to meet with a physician for the purpose of discussing the physical and psychological risks of abortion. Any requests shall be evidenced in writing signed by the pregnant mother;\n\n(3)The pregnancy help center is under no obligation to communicate with the abortion provider in any way, and is under no obligation to submit any written or other form of confirmation that the pregnant mother consulted with the pregnancy help center. The pregnancy help center may voluntarily provide a written statement of assessment to the abortion provider, whose name the woman shall give to the pregnancy help center, if the pregnancy help center obtains information that indicates that the pregnant mother has been subjected to coercion or that her decision to consider an abortion is otherwise not voluntary or not informed. The physician shall make the physician's own independent determination whether or not a pregnant mother's consent to have an abortion is voluntary, uncoerced, and informed before having the pregnant mother sign a consent to an abortion. The physician shall review and consider any information provided by the pregnancy help center as one source of information, which in no way binds the physician, who shall make an independent determination consistent with the provisions of §§34-23A-53 to 34-23A-59.2, inclusive, the common law requirements, and accepted medical standards;\n\n(4)Any written statement or summary of assessment prepared by the pregnancy help center as a result of counseling of a pregnant mother as a result of the procedures created by §§34-23A-53 to 34-23A-59.2, inclusive, may be forwarded by the pregnancy help center, in its discretion, to the abortion physician. If forwarded to the physician, the written statement or summary of assessment shall be maintained as a permanent part of the pregnant mother's medical records. Other than forwarding such documents to the abortion physician, no information obtained by the pregnancy help center from the pregnant mother may be released, without the written signed consent of the pregnant mother or unless the release is in accordance with federal, state, or local law;\n\n(5)Commencing on September 1, 2016, the counseling authorized pursuant to this section shall be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Policy and Procedures Guidelines developed and promulgated by the South Dakota Association of Registered Pregnancy Help Centers and adopted in 2015.\n\nNothing in §§34-23A-53 to 34-23A-59.2, inclusive, may be construed to impose any liability upon a pregnancy help center. However, the failure of a pregnancy help center to comply with the conditions of §34-23A-58.1, 34-23A-59.1 or this section for being authorized to provide the pregnancy help center counseling, if uncorrected, may result in the Department of Health removing the pregnancy help center from the state's registry of pregnancy help centers.\n\nSource:SL 2011, ch 161, §6; SL 2012, ch 186, §7; SL 2016, ch 179, §3; SL 2018, ch 205, §16.",
