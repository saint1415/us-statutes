The board shall notify each public safety answering point when the list of public safety answering points eligible for funding pursuant to this section changes. The Department of Public Safety shall:\n\n(1)Distribute twenty-six percent of the money deposited in the fund based on the ratio of the population of each eligible public safety answering point to the population of all the eligible public safety answering points; and\n\n(2)Transfer seventy-four percent of the money deposited in the fund to the South Dakota 911 coordination fund.\n\nThe Department of Public Safety shall base the allocation of money for population on the most recent decennial census of the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census and the population estimate published by the United States Census Bureau for each year ending in five. The Department of Public Safety shall make distributions from the public safety 911 emergency fund each quarter. The secretary of the Department of Public Safety shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay each public safety answering point its share of the distribution.\n\nSource:SL 2018, ch 208, §3.",
