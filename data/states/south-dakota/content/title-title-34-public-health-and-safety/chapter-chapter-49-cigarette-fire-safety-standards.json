Such a program ensures that the testing repeatability remains within the required repeatability values stated in §34-49-2 for all test trials used to certify cigarettes in accordance with this chapter;\n\n(8)\"Repeatability,\" the range of values within which the repeat results of cigarette test trials from a single laboratory will fall ninety-five percent of the time;\n\n(9)\"Sale,\" any transfer of title or possession or both, exchange or barter, conditional or otherwise, in any manner or by any means whatever or any agreement therefor. In addition to cash and credit sales, the giving of cigarettes as samples, prizes, or gifts, and the exchanging of cigarettes for any consideration other than money, are considered sales;\n\n(10)\"Secretary,\" the secretary of revenue;\n\n(11)\"Sell,\" to sell, or to offer or agree to do the same;\n\n(12)\"State fire marshal,\" the state fire marshal designated pursuant to chapter 34-29B.\n\nSource:SL 2009, ch 172, §1, eff.
