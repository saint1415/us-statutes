Vehicular homicide.\n\nAny person who, while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or substances in a manner and to a degree prohibited by §32-23-1, without design to effect death, operates or drives a vehicle of any kind in a negligent manner and thereby causes the death of another person, including an unborn child, is guilty of vehicular homicide. Vehicular homicide is a Class 3 felony. In addition to any other penalty prescribed by law, the court shall order that the driver's license of any person convicted of vehicular homicide be revoked for a period of not less than ten years from the date sentence is imposed or ten years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. In the event the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver's license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation.\n\nSource:SL 1983, ch 176, §1; SL 1988, ch 186; SL 1993, ch 174, §1; SL 1995, ch 122, §8; SL 2000, ch 97, §1; SL 2000, ch 98, §1; SL 2006, ch 165, §5; SL 2006, ch 168, §16; SL 2009, ch 115, §1.",
