Unless a higher mandatory sentence applies, a conviction involving fourteen milligrams or more of fentanyl shall be punished by a mandatory sentence of at least ten years in a state correctional facility.\n\nThe distribution of a substance listed in Schedules I or II to a minor is a Class 2 felony. A first conviction under this section shall be punished by a mandatory sentence in a state correctional facility of at least one year, which sentence may not be suspended. Probation, suspended imposition of sentence, or suspended execution of sentence may not form the basis for reducing the mandatory time of incarceration required by this section. A second or subsequent conviction under this section shall be punished by a mandatory sentence in a state correctional facility of at least ten years, which sentence may not be suspended. Probation, suspended imposition of sentence, or suspended execution of sentence may not form the basis for reducing the mandatory time of incarceration required by this section.

Probation, suspended imposition of sentence, or suspended execution of sentence, may not form the basis for reducing the mandatory time of incarceration required by this section.\n\nAny conviction for, or plea of guilty to, an offense in another state which, if committed in this state, would be a violation of this section, and occurring within fifteen years prior to the date of the violation being charged, must be used to determine if the violation being charged is a second or subsequent offense.\n\nAny person who, for consideration, intentionally distributes any controlled substance or counterfeit substance in violation of this section and another person dies as a direct result of using that substance is guilty of a Class 2 felony.
