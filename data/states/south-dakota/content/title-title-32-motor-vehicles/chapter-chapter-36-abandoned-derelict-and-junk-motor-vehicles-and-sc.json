Declaration of public interest in disposal.\n\nAbandoned, derelict, and junk motor vehicles and other scrap metals constitute a hazard to the health and welfare of the people of the State of South Dakota in that such vehicles and other scrap metals can harbor noxious diseases, furnish shelter and breeding places for vermin, and present physical dangers to the safety and well-being of children and other citizens. Abandoned, derelict, and junk motor vehicles and other scrap metals also constitute a blight on the landscape of the State of South Dakota and, therefore, are a detriment to the environment. The indiscriminate abandonment and retirement of motor vehicles and other scrap metals constitute a waste of valuable sources of useful metal. It is therefore in the public interest that the present accumulation of abandoned, derelict, and junk motor vehicles and other scrap metals be eliminated, that future abandonment, dereliction, and junking of motor vehicles and other scrap metals be discouraged, that the expansion of existing scrap recycling facilities be developed, and that other acceptable and economically useful methods for the disposal of abandoned, derelict, and junk motor vehicles and other scrap metals be developed.\n\nSource:SL 1972, ch 197, §1.",
