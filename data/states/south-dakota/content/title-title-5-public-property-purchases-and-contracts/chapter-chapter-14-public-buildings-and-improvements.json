The bureau shall administer the fund and maintain it separately in order to conduct maintenance and repair on state-owned buildings pursuant to this chapter. The projects to receive funding shall be selected from a state-wide maintenance and repair priority list developed by the bureau. The Board of Regents shall annually establish the priority for maintenance and repair projects involving academic and revenue project buildings under its control. Any project of the Board of Regents involving an academic building pursuant to §13-51-1 may be financed from the education facilities fund established under §13-51-2 according to the order of priority determined by the board. The Bureau of Human Resources and Administration shall place on the prioritized list of projects to be financed through the state-wide maintenance and repair fund any project involving an academic building that has not been financed through §13-51-2. The Board of Regents shall have charge of the maintenance and repair of revenue bond project buildings as provided in chapter 13-51A. However, in order to be eligible to receive funding, in whole or in part, from the state-wide maintenance and repair fund, each agency, board, bureau, or department of state government, including the Board of Regents, shall submit to the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration a complete list of all proposed maintenance and repair projects notwithstanding other available funding sources for those projects. After the bureau determines which projects contained in the priority list are to receive funding, those projects that are not to be funded through the state-wide maintenance and repair fund may be financed by other funding sources. The priority list may be reprioritized if an emergency arises and a written determination made by the bureau of the basis for the emergency is included with the state-wide maintenance and repair priority list.\n\nSource: SL 1994, ch 58, §3; SL 2011, ch 2, §48; SL 2024, ch 1 (Ex.
