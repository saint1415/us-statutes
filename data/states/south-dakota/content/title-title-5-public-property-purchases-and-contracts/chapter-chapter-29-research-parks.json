Legislative findings.\n\nThe Legislature finds that to increase research and technology- related economic activity in South Dakota and to expand the opportunities for South Dakota faculty members, researchers, and students to participate in the application of research results and technological innovations in commerce, government, or public service, it is critically important to encourage research opportunities and programs within the regental system. To these ends, the Legislature intends that this chapter be construed as authorizing and encouraging coordinated public and private investments in facilities situated on lands controlled by the Board of Regents and designed to support commercial application of research results and technological innovations.\n\nSource:SL 2012, ch 46, §1.",
