If the values are expressed in feet, a definition of one foot equals 0.3048 meter exactly is used as the standard foot for the South Dakota state plane coordinate system. One of the two distances, to be known as the east or x-coordinate, gives the distance east of the y-axis; the other, to be known as the north or y-coordinate, gives the distance north of the x-axis. The y-axis of any zone is parallel with the central meridian of that zone. The x-axis of any zone is at the right angles to the central meridian of that zone. Height is the coordinate value of the vertical elements of the National Spatial Reference System expressed as feet or meters and identified as ellipsoid height or orthometric height.\n\nSource: SL 1947, ch 231, §3; SDC Supp 1960, §18.0303; SL 1988, ch 349, §6; SL 1991, ch 364; SL 2022, ch 163, §5.",
