Purpose of chapter.\n\nIt is the purpose of this chapter to protect and perpetuate public land survey corners and information concerning the location of such corners by requiring the systematic establishment of monuments and filing of information concerning the marking of the location of such public land survey corners and to allow the systematic location of other property corners, thereby providing for property security and a coherent system of property location and identification; and thereby eliminating the repeated necessity for reestablishment and relocations of such corners once they are established and located.\n\nSource:SL 1967, ch 58, §2.",
