Policy of state--Purpose of chapter.\n\nIt is hereby declared to be the public policy of the state to achieve and maintain reasonable levels of air quality which will protect human health and safety, prevent injury to plant and animal life and property, foster the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants, promote the economic and social development of the state and, to the greatest degree practicable, facilitate the enjoyment of the natural attractions of the state. It is also declared that local and regional air pollution control programs are to be supported to the extent practicable as essential instruments for the securing and maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality. To these ends it is the purpose of this chapter to provide for a coordinated state-wide program of air pollution prevention, abatement and control, for an appropriate distribution of responsibilities among the state and local units of government, and to facilitate cooperation across jurisdictional lines in dealing with problems of air pollution not confined within single jurisdictions, and to provide a framework within which all values may be balanced in the public interest.\n\nSource:SL 1970, ch 203, §1; SDCL Supp, §34-16A-1.",
