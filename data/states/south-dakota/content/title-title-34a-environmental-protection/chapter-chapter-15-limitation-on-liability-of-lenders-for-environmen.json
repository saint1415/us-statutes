Legislative findings.\n\nThe Legislature hereby finds, and declare to be the public policy of this state, that:\n\n(1)Environmental laws of the United States and this state provide that the owner of the real property is liable for the cleanup of property contamination and define who is the owner of such property;\n\n(2)If a borrower defaults on a loan, a lender must decide whether to foreclose and potentially become the owner. For fear of becoming liable for conditions they did not create, lenders are showing a reluctance to foreclose, thus leaving no one responsible for the cleanup. Additionally, lenders are reluctant to lend to certain types of businesses because of this potential liability;\n\n(3)So that lenders can predict with more certainty what the costs will be if they foreclose, it is the intent of the Legislature to limit third-party liability for lenders who comply with certain conditions.\n\nSource:SL 1992, ch 261, §1.",

State brownfields revitalization and economic development program--Liability for costs of a response action or remediation--Limitation.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of §34A-15-6, a lender-owner is not liable for environmental, response, cleanup, or remediation costs at a brownfields site approved by the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources for participation in the state brownfields revitalization and economic development program unless:\n\n(1)The lender-owner, its employees, or agents directly cause an immediate release or directly exacerbate a release of the regulated substances on or from the property or directly violate any environmental statute or regulation; or\n\n(2)The lender-owner, its employees, or agents knowingly and willfully compelled the borrower to:\n\n(a)Perform an action that caused an immediate release of regulated substances in excess of reportable quantities; or\n\n(b)Violate any environmental statute or regulation.\n\nLiability pursuant to this section is limited to the cost for a response action or remediation that is directly attributable to the lender-owner's activities set forth in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this section. Liability arises only if the lender-owner's actions were the proximate cause of the release or violation. Ownership or control of the property pursuant to a security interest during or after foreclosure does not by itself result in liability. No lender-owner is liable for any response action or remediation if the response action or remediation arises solely from a release of regulated substances in excess of reportable quantities that occurred before or commences before and continues after foreclosure. However, the lender-owner is responsible for the portion of the response action or remediation that is directly attributable to the lender-owner's aggravation of a release. A release of regulated substances in excess of reportable quantities discovered in the course of conducting environmental due diligence is presumed to be a prior or continuing release on the property.\n\nSource: SL 2004, ch 228, §1; SL 2021, ch 1 (Ex.
