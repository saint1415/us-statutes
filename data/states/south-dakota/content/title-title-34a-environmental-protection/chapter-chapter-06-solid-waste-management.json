Legislative findings.\n\nThe Legislature finds that other states have imposed stringent standards for the proper collection and disposal of solid waste and that without such standards and enforcement of them, South Dakota could be burdened with the importation and disposal in the state of large amounts of solid waste from other states by persons and firms who may not have the capability to properly dispose of the waste or who wish to avoid the costs and requirements for proper, effective and safe disposal of such waste in the state of origin.\n\nThe Legislature finds that the disposal of large quantities of solid waste in this state will, in fact, impose additional burdens on the citizens of this state. Experience has shown that under the system of laws currently governing waste disposal in this country, this liability can be significant. For these and other reasons, the Legislature finds that it is reasonable and necessary to require that any person intending to dispose of waste in this state comply with the provisions of §§34A-6-1.2 to 34A-6-1.38, inclusive.\n\nThe Legislature further finds that to ensure a minimum safe level of solid waste regulation nationally, the United States Environmental Protection Agency is promulgating a comprehensive set of rules to govern the disposal of solid waste and that South Dakota must be prepared to comply with those rules.\n\nSource:SL 1989, ch 306, §2.",

Solid waste management policy established.\n\nThe protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state and the protection of the environment require the safe and sanitary disposal of solid waste. An effective and efficient solid waste disposal program protects the environment and the public, and provides the most practical and beneficial use of the material and energy values of solid waste. While recognizing the continuing necessity for the existence of landfills, alternative methods of managing solid waste and the reduction in the reliance upon land disposal of solid waste are encouraged. To promote these goals, the following solid waste management hierarchy, in descending order of preference, is established as the solid waste management policy of the state:\n\n(1)Volume reduction at the source.\n\n(2)Recycling and reuse.\n\n(3)Use for energy production, if appropriate.\n\n(4)Disposal in landfills or combustion for volume reduction.\n\nIn the implementation of this solid waste management policy, the state shall establish and maintain a cooperative state and local program of project planning, and technical and financial assistance to encourage comprehensive solid waste management.\n\nSource:SL 1989, ch 306, §3.",

The fee imposed by this section is in addition to all other fees and taxes levied by law and must be added to and constitute part of any other fee charged by the operator or owner of the solid waste disposal facility. Neither this fee nor any fees authorized by §34A-6-1.38 may be imposed upon the disposal of waste by the state. In the case of any solid waste disposal facility that receives solid waste only from entities that have implemented a solid waste source reduction and recycling program, the fees provided for in this section are required if the facility receives more than two hundred fifty thousand tons of solid waste per year. Solid waste disposal facilities owned or operated by political subdivisions are exempt from this section.\n\nThe owner of the solid waste disposal facility shall pay the disposal fee. The obligation of the owner to pay the fee accrues at the time solid waste is disposed of at a solid waste facility. The fee imposed by this section is due and payable on or before the fifteenth day of the month next succeeding the month in which the fee accrued, together with a return on such form or forms as may be prescribed by the secretary of revenue. Each owner of a facility who is required to pay the fee imposed by this section shall keep complete and accurate records in such form as the board or the secretary of revenue, by rule promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, may require.\n\nFees collected under this section must be deposited in the South Dakota environment and water resources trust fund established pursuant to §46A-1-82.\n\nSource: SL 1989, ch 306, §18; SL 1992, ch 256; SL 2022, ch 138, §1.",

A general permit issued by the board may be subject to such terms and conditions for installation, establishment, modification, operation, or abandonment of a category of solid waste treatment, storage, or disposal as the board finds reasonably necessary to adequately protect the public health, safety, welfare, and the environment of this state. Waste treatment, storage, or disposal activities conducted in conformity with a general permit do not require a permit issued under §34A-6-1.13.\n\nA general permit shall remain in effect until suspended, revoked, or modified by the board. A general permit may be modified after public notice and opportunity for public hearing. A general permit may be suspended or revoked after publication of notice and order of suspension and revocation in at least three newspapers of general circulation in this state. If an affected facility or interested party wishes to contest the order, a request for hearing shall be filed with the department within twenty days. A hearing on the matter shall be held as soon thereafter as practicable. Notice of hearing shall be published in at least three newspapers of general circulation in this state.

L. 94-580, as amended to January 1, 2011, will reduce the available landfill capacity in the state for the disposal of municipal solid waste. The Legislature further finds:\n\n(1)That maximum solid waste source reduction, reuse, recycling, and composting are preferable to land disposal, are the most economically sound and environmentally safe methods of solid waste management and are in the best interest of the state in order to protect public health and the environment and to conserve resources, energy, and tax dollars; and\n\n(2)That education, research, development, and innovation in the design, management, and operation of source reduction, reuse, recycling, and composting are essential in reducing operating costs and providing incentives for the use of these systems and operations and their products.\n\nSource:SL 1992, ch 254, §21; SL 2011, ch 165, §123.",

      "text": "34A-6-60. Legislative intent to reduce amount of solid waste disposed in landfills.\n\nThe Legislature intends by §§34A-6-59 to 34A-6-92, inclusive, to establish programs and regulations that reduce the waste stream disposed of in landfills in this state and thus protect the public health, safety, and welfare of all South Dakotans, protect the environment, and return resources back to industry for reuse. The goal of the state is to reduce the amount of materials in the waste stream being landfilled. The amount of materials being landfilled shall be reduced using appropriate methods and technology through the practice of solid waste reduction, waste diversion, reuse, recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy. The goal of the state is to reduce the waste stream disposed in landfills by fifty percent by July 1, 2001. For the purposes of this section, the term, waste stream, means the disposal of solid waste as defined in §34A-6-1.3.\n\nThe base year for establishing the amount of materials in the waste stream is the calendar year 1990. Total tonnage of solid waste landfilled in the calendar year 1990 is the basis for all waste reduction calculations. In the absence of scale data and cubic yardage data of waste materials landfilled, the base tonnage is calculated as eight-tenths of a ton per year per person, in residence, serviced by the landfill. Tonnage may be estimated by equating one cubic yard of solid waste received at the landfill gate to seven hundred pounds of solid waste. In determining the reduction level of the waste stream, it is assumed that each person in 1990 generated eight-tenths of a ton per year of municipal solid waste.\n\nAny landfill that conducted waste reduction or recycling programs before the 1990 base calendar year and increased its ability to reduce waste stream volume may receive credit for prior recycled tonnage in the solid waste source reduction and recycling plan required by §34A-6-74. Similarly, any landfill that has experienced or will experience a growth in its population served may submit justification for increased tonnage, even after waste reduction or recycling programs have been implemented.\n\nSource:SL 1992, ch 254, §22; SL 1998, ch 203, §1.",
