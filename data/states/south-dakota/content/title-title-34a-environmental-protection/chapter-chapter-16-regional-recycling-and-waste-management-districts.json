Creation of a regional recycling and waste management district.\n\nAny municipality, county, or portion of a county within this state and any one or more other municipalities, counties, or portions of counties within this state may create a regional recycling and waste management district, which may provide facilities and services pursuant to this chapter for the management of solid waste as defined in §34A-6-1.3. A district may exercise its powers upon filing with the secretary of state a notice of incorporation pursuant to chapter 6-10. A county may be divided into more than one regional recycling and waste management district; however, a municipality may only be included in a district if the entire area of the municipality lies within the district. No geographical area may be included in more than one regional recycling and waste management district, and the lands within a district need not be contiguous, provided that no more than one hundred twenty miles may intervene between noncontiguous areas. The creation of a regional recycling and waste management district shall be authorized by approval of the district's proposed articles of incorporation through a resolution of the governing body of each county and municipality listed in the proposed articles as being necessary for incorporation of the district. No county or municipality may be included in a district unless its governing body has adopted an authorizing resolution pursuant to this chapter.\n\nSource:SL 1993, ch 259, §1.",

Legislative findings.\n\nThe Legislature hereby finds that:\n\n(1)The high and increasing cost of owning, operating, and closure of solid waste facilities, and the financing thereof, and the increasing federal and other regulatory requirements pertaining to such solid waste facilities, has created an urgent demand for action by counties, municipalities, and others in this state;\n\n(2)Such urgent demands, together with high and increasing costs and regulatory requirements, may result in the inability of various counties and municipalities to respond in a timely manner and thereby endanger the health and safety of the citizens of this state;\n\n(3)Such high and increasing costs require new methods for the financing of solid waste management facilities;\n\n(4)It is, accordingly, in furtherance of the interest and welfare of all citizens of South Dakota that regional recycling and waste management districts be permitted to be formed by counties and municipalities of this state in a timely manner for the purpose of financing solid waste management facilities and closing existing facilities and, to this end, it is intended that this chapter be liberally construed to accomplish these purposes;\n\n(5)There is an immediate need to protect the public peace, health, and safety of the state by authorizing the formation of regional recycling and waste management districts to respond to such urgent demands, high and increasing costs and regulatory requirements imposed by the federal government in connection with such matters, and in order to protect municipalities and counties, and their residents, from the financial burdens of such regulations and the potential health consequences which may result if adequate and modern solid waste management facilities are not constructed, operated, and maintained; and\n\n(6)That the foregoing urgent demand, high and increasing costs and regulatory requirements pose an immediate threat to the existing public institutions of this state and to the public health and safety of this state and its people.\n\nSource:SL 1993, ch 259, §50.",
