Inconvenient forum.\n\n(a) A court of this state which has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child-custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.\n\n(b) Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:\n\n(1)Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;\n\n(2)The length of time the child has resided outside this state;\n\n(3)The distance between the court in this state and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;\n\n(4)The relative financial circumstances of the parties;\n\n(5)Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;\n\n(6)The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;\n\n(7)The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and\n\n(8)The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.\n\n(c) If a court of this state determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.\n\n(d) A court of this state may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if a child-custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.\n\nSource:SL 2005, ch 137, §19.",
