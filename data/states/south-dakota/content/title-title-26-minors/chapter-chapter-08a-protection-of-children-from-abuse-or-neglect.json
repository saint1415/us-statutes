Final decree of disposition--Permitted disposition when parental rights not terminated--Annual permanency hearing for child in foster care.\n\nOn completion of the dispositional phase of the proceeding, the court shall enter a final decree of disposition. If the final decree of disposition does not terminate parental rights, the decree shall include one or more of the following provisions which the court finds appropriate as the least restrictive alternative available:\n\n(1)The court may place the child in the custody of one or both of the child's parents, a guardian, a relative of the child or another suitable person, or a party or agency, with or without protective supervision, or the Department of Social Services, subject to the conditions and the length of time that the court deems necessary or appropriate. If the court returns custody to the child's parent, guardian, or custodian, such return of custody may be with supervision during which the court may require the parent, guardian, custodian, and any other adult residing in the home, to cooperate with home visits by the department and may require the parent, guardian, custodian, and any other adult residing in the home, to submit, at the request of the department, to tests for alcohol, marijuana, or any controlled drug or substance.

As used in this section, any controlled drug or substance means a controlled drug or substance which was not lawfully prescribed by a practitioner as authorized by chapters 22-42 and 34-20B;\n\n(2)The court after determining that a compelling reason exists to place the child who is sixteen years of age or older in another planned permanent living arrangement rather than with a relative or with a legal guardian other than the department may place the child in the custody of the department or a child placement agency, with or without guardianship of the child, until the child attains the age of majority or until an earlier date or event as determined by the court;\n\n(3)The court may order that the child be examined or treated by a physician or by a qualified mental health professional or that the child receive other special care and may place the child in a suitable facility for such purposes under conditions that the court deems necessary or appropriate. On completion of the examination, treatment, or hospitalization and on a full report to the court, the court shall conduct a supplemental dispositional hearing or hearings and shall make disposition of the child as otherwise provided in this section or, if the evidence shows need, the court may consider termination of parental rights as an appropriate possible alternative in keeping with the best interests and welfare of the child.\n\nIf disposition of the child under this section involves the removal from or nonreturn of the child to the home of the child's parents, guardian, or custodian and placement of the child in the custody of the department for placement in foster care, the court shall include in the decree a written judicial determination that continuation of the child's placement in the home of the child's parents, guardian, or custodian would be contrary to the welfare of the child and that reasonable efforts were made by the department to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the home.

However, if the defendant is excluded, the testimony of the child shall be by two-way, closed-circuit television such that the testimony of the child is televised in the courtroom and simultaneously thereto, a monitor in the room in which the child is testifying displays a view of the courtroom which view shall include the defendant. The right to have the defendant's image televised in the room in which the child is testifying is a right of the defendant which the defendant may waive. If the defendant is excluded from the room in which the child is testifying, the court must provide for instantaneous communication between the defendant and defense counsel and grant reasonable court recesses during the testimony for consultation between the defendant and defense counsel. The court may communicate by audio system with attorneys outside of the courtroom.\n\nIf, on the motion of the prosecuting attorney and outside the presence of the jury, the court makes a specific finding that the child will suffer substantial emotional distress that will impair the ability of the child to communicate due to the presence of the jury, the court may exclude the jury from the room in which the child is testifying. The testimony of the child must be televised at the same time to the courtroom by closed circuit television equipment.\n\nSource: SL 1993, ch 205, §2; SL 2023, ch 85, §1.",
