The RAI is based upon best practice standards that have been tested and implemented in other JDAI jurisdictions across the nation. The overall risk score is a guide in making the initial decision whether to detain in secure detention, utilize an alternative to secure detention, or release with or without conditions pending hearing.\n\n(b) As per the authority designated in subdivision 26-7A-1(20), the presiding judge in each circuit shall appoint juvenile detention staff or juvenile reception and intake center staff to serve as intake officers.\n\n(c) The State Court Administrator's Office shall provide statewide training on use of the RAI. After the completion of RAI training, all appointed Intake Officers shall complete the RAI on all detention intakes to distinguish between juveniles who are likely to abscond or commit new crimes and those who are not.\n\n(d) The State Court Administrator's Office shall compile the following data to be collected by any court appointed intake officer: The number of juveniles detained and released shall be reported along with each juvenile's gender, race, ethnicity, age and offense as well as all assessment information including staff decision, overrides and program information.\n\nSource:SL 2015, ch 276 (Supreme Court Rule 15-14), eff.
