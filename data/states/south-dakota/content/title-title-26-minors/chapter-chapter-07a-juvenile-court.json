Procedure upon finding that juvenile not competent to proceed but probably will be competent in foreseeable future.\n\nIf, following the competency determination hearing pursuant to §26-7A-32.7, the court finds that the juvenile is not competent to proceed, but additionally finds that there exists a substantial probability that the juvenile will be competent in the foreseeable future, the court shall continue the suspension of the proceedings and may refer the juvenile to an approved facility for evaluation and treatment of the mental health and behavioral needs identified in the report of the examiner. During this time the court may make orders that it deems appropriate for services that may assist the juvenile in attaining competency. Evaluation and treatment should be conducted in the least restrictive environment with due regard to the best interests of the child and the public. Notwithstanding any order pursuant to this section, the administration of any psychotropic medication shall comply with the procedures set forth in chapter 27A-15.\n\nThe juvenile shall be examined and a report forwarded to the court relating to the juvenile's competency to proceed and its reasons at the following intervals following referral: at the end of sixty days or sooner; at the end of one hundred eighty days; and at the end of one year. Upon receipt of the report, the court shall forward the report to the parties and without delay set a date for a conference of the parties or, upon a motion of any party, set a hearing on the question of the juvenile's competency to proceed. If the court finds that the juvenile is not competent to proceed, but there exists a substantial probability that the juvenile will be competent to proceed in the foreseeable future, the proceedings shall remain suspended pending further review or hearing.\n\nIf more than one year has elapsed since the suspension of the proceedings, the court shall promptly hold a hearing to determine whether there exists a substantial probability that the juvenile will be competent in the foreseeable future. The burden of proof is on the state in any such hearing. If the court finds that there does not exist a substantial probability that the juvenile will be competent in the foreseeable future, the court shall review the juvenile's condition to determine appropriate placement and may dismiss the petition or, if post-adjudication, may vacate the adjudication order and dismiss the petition.\n\nIf, during the suspension of the proceedings, the juvenile reaches eighteen years of age or is emancipated under Title 26, the court may evaluate the appropriateness of placing the juvenile in an appropriate institution for the care and treatment of adults with mental illness or developmental disability for observation, care, and treatment.\n\nThe court shall set a time for resumption of the proceedings if at any point the court finds that the juvenile is now competent to proceed.\n\nSource:SL 2013, ch 121, §11.",

Admission or denial of alleged juvenile cited violation--Procedure.\n\nIf the state's attorney elects to proceed on the citation pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(3), the child shall be asked for an admission or denial of the alleged violation. If the child admits to the violation, the court shall accept the admission and enter a judgment pursuant to §26-7A-129. If the child denies committing the violation, the case may be tried according to procedure adopted by the presiding judge of each judicial circuit and approved by the Supreme Court, but a jury trial may not be granted.\n\nIf the child fails to appear in court at the time set in the citation or set by subsequent postponement, the court may either issue a summons to appear and set a new date for hearing to show cause, the court may consider that failure to appear constitutes an admission to the allegations contained in the complaint and may accordingly enter a judgment for payment, or may grant permission to the state's attorney to file a petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5).\n\nIf the child fails to comply with the terms of the judgment, the court may issue a summons to appear and show cause, or assess against the child's parents or guardians the amount of the citation and any restitution owed pursuant to §26-7A-129 or may grant permission to the state's attorney to file a petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5).\n\nSource:SL 2015, ch 152, §39, eff.

If a child is unable to pay a fine, court costs, or restitution as ordered by the court, any party may request that the court order community service in lieu of the monetary judgment. At no time may a court order a child to probation or detention upon entry of a judgment on a cited violation. A judgment on a cited violation shall be a confidential matter pursuant to subsection 15-15A-7(p) but the state's attorney may maintain a nonpublic record of the judgment for purposes of determining eligibility under §26-7A-127.\n\nSource:SL 2015, ch 152, §40, eff.
