      "text": "26-12-15. Interstate Compact on Juveniles continued in force--Text of compact.\n\nThere continues in force a compact between this state and any other state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\nINTERSTATE COMPACT ON JUVENILES\n\nARTICLE I, PURPOSE\n\nThe compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; to ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; to return juveniles who have run away, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; to make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; to provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles.\n\nIn addition, this compact will: equitably allocate the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compacting states; establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across the state lines; establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; to coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.\n\nIt is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore,the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.\n\nARTICLE II, DEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly require a different construction:\n\n(1)\"By-laws\" means those by-laws established by the Interstate Commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling its actions or conduct;\n\n(2)\"Compact administrator\" means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact, responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of juveniles subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the state council under this compact;\n\n(3)\"Compacting state\" means any state that has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact;\n\n(4)\"Commissioner\" means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to Article III of this compact;\n\n(5)\"Court\" means any court having jurisdiction over delinquent, neglected, or dependent children;\n\n(6)\"Deputy compact administrator\" means the individual, if any, in each compacting state appointed to act on behalf of a compact administrator pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of juveniles subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the state council under this compact;\n\n(7)\"Interstate Commission\" means the Interstate Commission for Juveniles created by Article III of this compact;\n\n(8)\"Juvenile\" means any person defined as a juvenile in any member state or by the rules of the Interstate Commission, including\n\n(a)Accused delinquent--a person charged with an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n\n(b)Adjudicated delinquent--a person found to have committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n\n(c)Accused status offender--a person charged with an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult;\n\n(d)Adjudicated status offender--a person found to have committed an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult; and\n\n(e)Nonoffender--a person in need of supervision who has not been accused or adjudicated a status offender or delinquent.\n\n(9)\"Noncompacting state\" means any state that has not enacted the enabling legislation for this compact;\n\n(10)\"Probation or Parole\" means any kind of supervision or conditional release of juveniles authorized under the laws of the compacting states;\n\n(11)\"Rule\" means a written statement by the Interstate Commission promulgated pursuant to Article VI of this compact that is of general applicability, implements, interprets, or prescribes a policy or provision of the compact, or an organizational, procedural, or practice requirement of the commission, and has the force and effect of statutory law in a compacting state, and includes the amendment, repeal, or suspension of an existing rule;\n\n(12)\"State\" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia (or its designee), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas Islands.\n\nARTICLE III, INTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR JUVENILES\n\nThe compacting states hereby create the Interstate Commission for Juveniles.

However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.\n\nARTICLE IX, THE STATE COUNCIL\n\nEach member state shall create a State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision. While each state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership must include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government, victims' groups and the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator, or designee. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator or deputy compact administrator. Each state council will advise and may exercise oversight and advocacy concerning that state's participation in Interstate Commission activities and other duties as may be determined by that state, including but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.\n\nARTICLE X, COMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT\n\nAny state, the District of Columbia (or its designee), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas Islands as defined in Article II of this compact is eligible to become a compacting state. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than thirty-five of the states.

Thereafter it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.\n\nThe Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.\n\nARTICLE XI, WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT\n\nSection A.

Technical Assistance, Fines, Suspension, Termination and Default\n\nIf the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the by-laws or duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:\n\n(1)Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;\n\n(2)Alternative Dispute Resolution;\n\n(3)Fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission; and\n\n(4)Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the by-laws and rules have been exhausted and the Interstate Commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or the chief judicial officer of the state,the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the by-laws or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission by-laws and rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.\n\nWithin sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council of such termination.\n\nThe defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\nThe Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\nReinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.\n\nSection C. Judicial Enforcement\n\nThe Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and by-laws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nSection D. Dissolution of Compact\n\nThe compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.\n\nUpon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the by-laws.\n\nARTICLE XII, SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose.\n\nARTICLE XIII, BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\nSection A. Other Laws.\n\nNothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.\n\nAll compacting states' laws other than state Constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nSection B. Binding Effect of the Compact\n\nAll lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and by-laws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the compacting states.\n\nAll agreements between the Interstate Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\nUpon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.\n\nIn the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the same time this compact becomes effective.\n\nSource: SL 2004, ch 183, §1, eff.
