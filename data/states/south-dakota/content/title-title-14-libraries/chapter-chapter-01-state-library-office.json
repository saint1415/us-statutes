Publisher to provide electronic versions of textbooks--Cost--Legacy defined--Duty of Department of Education.\n\nUpon request, a publisher of a textbook that is adopted for instructional use by a school district shall furnish the South Dakota State Library with an electronic version of the textbook if the textbook is for a literary subject; or, if the textbook is for a nonliterary subject, such as natural sciences, computer science, mathematics, or music, an electronic version shall be furnished if the technology is available to convert the textbook directly to a format compatible with Braille translation software. The publisher shall provide the electronic file to the requesting agency within sixty days of receiving written notice that the file is needed. The cost of the electronic publisher's file may not exceed the cost of a print copy of the same title. Legacy materials are exempt from the requirements of this section. For purposes of this section, the term, legacy, means images and graphics requiring release and permission from another source other than the publisher. The Department of Education shall oversee the process established in this section to ensure that the textbooks and electronic files arrive by the start of the school year.\n\nSource:SL 2004, ch 138, §1.",
