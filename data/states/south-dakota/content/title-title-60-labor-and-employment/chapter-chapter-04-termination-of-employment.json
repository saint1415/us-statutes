However, nothing in this section may be construed to relieve such person from the obligation to mitigate damages. It is not a discriminatory or unfair employment practice pursuant to this section for an employer to offer, impose or have in effect a health or life insurance policy that makes distinctions between employees for the type of coverage or the cost of coverage based upon the employees' use of tobacco products.
