Calculation of interstate operator's inspection fee.\n\nFor each inspection fee assessed to interstate gas pipeline operators, the commission shall calculate its total actual expenses and obligations incurred in implementing and administering this chapter. All expenses directly attributable to specific interstate gas pipeline facilities shall be directly charged to the appropriate pipeline operators on an annual basis. For all expenses not directly attributable to interstate pipeline facilities, the commission shall assess each pipeline operator for a pro rata share of the expenses and obligations based on the percentage of the total miles of pipeline to be inspected that are operated or will be operated by each pipeline operator.\n\nSource:SL 1994, ch 357, §16; SL 2007, ch 273, §11.",

Initial inspection fee for interstate operators--Filing objections--Hearings--Delinquency fee.\n\nUpon certification as a federal agent, the commission shall assess an initial inspection fee upon all interstate gas pipeline operators. The initial inspection fee is based on the commission's estimated costs of its first six months of operation as a federal agent. The initial inspection fee shall be prorated based on each interstate gas pipeline operator's total miles of line located within this state. The operator may, within thirty days after the assessment is mailed, file written objections with the commission stating the grounds upon which it claims that the assessment is not reasonable. The commission shall within thirty days of receiving such objections hold a hearing and issue an order in accordance with its findings as to the proper amount to be assessed to the operator. The order shall be appealable pursuant to chapter 1-26. If an operator does not pay, or object to, the initial inspection fee within thirty days after the assessment is mailed, the commission may impose a delinquency fee of ten percent of the initial inspection fee and interest at the rate of fifteen percent per year on the portion of the initial inspection fee not paid. Fees collected under this section shall be deposited in the pipeline safety account established in §49-34B-9. Any interest earned on money in the fund shall be deposited in the fund. The money is continuously appropriated to the use of the commission to implement and administer the provisions of this chapter.\n\nSource:SL 1994, ch 357, §17.",
