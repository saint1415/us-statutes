Any measurements of stray current or voltage not made in compliance with commission rules shall be inadmissible before the commission or in any civil action. The commission rules shall be applicable to dairy producers, electric utilities, and all persons or entities involved in any way in the measurement or remediation of stray current or voltage in this state.\n\nSource:SL 2015, ch 237, §2.",

Notice to utility prerequisite to civil action--Utility measurements--Remedial procedures.\n\nAny dairy producer in this state who claims that the producer's dairy cows are being affected by any form or type of electrical energy allegedly attributable to an electric utility including, without limitation, stray current or voltage, shall, as a condition precedent to commencing any civil action against the utility, provide written notice of the affect to the utility. The notice shall specify why the dairy producer believes the producer's dairy cows are being affected by electrical energy attributable to the utility. Within fourteen business days of receipt of the notice, the utility shall take measurements at cow contact points at the dairy producer's dairy to identify the existence and magnitude of stray current or voltage, if any. If the utility finds a level of stray current or voltage at cow contact points in excess of the preventive action level, the utility shall promptly identify that portion, if any, of the stray current or voltage that is attributable to the utility's distribution system. If that portion of the stray current or voltage at cow contact points attributable to the utility's distribution system exceeds fifty percent of the preventive action level, the utility shall, within seven business days, commence and diligently pursue to completion, remedial procedures which shall reduce, and are reasonably likely to sustain, that portion of the stray current or voltage at cow contact points attributable to the utility's distribution system to fifty percent or less of the preventive action level, unless extraordinary circumstances prevent the utility from commencing remedial action within seven business days. In such case, the utility has an additional seven business days to commence and pursue to completion remedial procedures.\n\nSource:SL 2015, ch 237, §3.",
