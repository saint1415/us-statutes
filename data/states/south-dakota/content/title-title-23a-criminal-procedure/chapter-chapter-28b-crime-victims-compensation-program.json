Conviction of person for criminal conduct not required for award of compensation.\n\nAn award of compensation may be made without regard to whether any person is prosecuted or convicted for the criminal conduct that is the basis of the award. Proof of conviction of a person whose conduct gives rise to a claim is conclusive evidence that the crime was committed, unless an application for rehearing, an appeal of the conviction or a petition for certiorari is pending, or a rehearing or new trial has been ordered. The department may suspend proceedings under this chapter for any period it deems appropriate on the grounds that a prosecution for the conduct giving rise to a claim has been commenced or is imminent.\n\nSource:SL 1991, ch 201, §23.",
