If there is probable cause to believe him guilty of another offense, he must be committed or held thereon. If no evidence appears sufficient to charge him with any offense, he must, if in custody, be discharged or, if admitted to bail, have his bail exonerated.\n\nSource:SDC 1939 & Supp 1960, §34.3678; SDCL, §23-47-4; SL 1978, ch 178, §383.",
