Probationer. A probationer is defined as any person convicted of a felony or receiving a suspended imposition under §23A-27-13 on a felony charge and sentenced by a South Dakota court to a term of supervised probation exceeding six months. A probationer for the purpose of §§23A-48-15 to 23A-48-22, inclusive, does not include a person sentenced to drug court, a minor on juvenile court probation, or a person serving probation only on a misdemeanor offense under the laws of the State of South Dakota.\n\nC.Probation Violation.
