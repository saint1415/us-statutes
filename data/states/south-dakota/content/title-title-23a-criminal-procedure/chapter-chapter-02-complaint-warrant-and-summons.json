Complaint as statement of offense--Signature under oath--Traffic ticket issued by law enforcement officer.\n\nA complaint is a written statement of the essential facts constituting an offense charged. The complaint shall be signed under oath before a person authorized to administer oaths in the State of South Dakota. A law enforcement officer, in lieu of signing a complaint for a misdemeanor or felony under oath, may sign a statement printed or written on a complaint or summons on a uniform traffic ticket stating: \"I declare and affirm under the penalties of perjury that this complaint or summons has been examined by me, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, is in all things true and correct.\" Any person who signs a statement as required by this section, knowing the statement to be false or untrue, in whole or in part, is guilty of perjury.\n\nSource:SDC 1939 & Supp 1960, §34.1501; SDCL §23-19-2; SL 1978, ch 178, §3; SL 2015, ch 134, §2; SL 2017, ch 105, §1.",

If circumstances make it reasonable to do so in the absence of a written affidavit, an arrest warrant may be issued upon sworn oral testimony of a person who is not in the physical presence of a committing magistrate if the committing magistrate is satisfied that probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant. The sworn oral testimony may be communicated to the magistrate by telephone or other appropriate means and shall be recorded and transcribed. After transcription the statement shall be certified by the magistrate and filed with the court. This statement shall be deemed to be an affidavit and complaint for purposes of this section. In cases of alleged rape, incest, or sexual contact, if the victim is a minor, the court may limit access to the affidavit pursuant to §23A-6-22.1. Upon the request of the prosecuting attorney, a summons instead of a warrant shall be used. More than one warrant or summons may be issued on the same complaint. If a defendant fails to appear in response to a summons, a warrant shall be issued.\n\nSource:CCrimP 1877, §95; CL 1887, §7120; RCCrimP 1903, §92; RC 1919, §4528; SDC 1939 & Supp 1960, §34.1615; SDCL §23-21-5; SL 1978, ch 178, §4; SL 1992, ch 171; SL 2011, ch 124, §3.",
