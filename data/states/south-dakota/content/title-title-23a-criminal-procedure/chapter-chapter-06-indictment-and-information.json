A circuit court judge, or magistrate judge in an appropriate case, may issue a summons instead of a warrant upon the request of a prosecuting attorney. Upon like request or direction a court may issue more than one warrant or summons for the same defendant. The warrant or summons shall be delivered to a law enforcement officer or other person authorized by law to execute or serve it. If a defendant fails to appear in response to a summons, a warrant shall be issued.\n\nSource:SDC 1939 & Supp 1960, §34.1235; SDCL, §23-31-9; SL 1978, ch 178, §85; SL 1999, ch 121, §2.",
