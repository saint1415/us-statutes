If a witness is committed for failure to give bail to appear to testify at a trial or hearing, the court on written motion of the witness and upon notice to the parties may direct that his deposition be taken. After the deposition has been subscribed the court may discharge the witness.\n\nSource:SL 1978, ch 178, §131; SL 1979, ch 159, §10.",

On motion of a party upon whom the notice is served, the court for cause shown may extend or shorten the time for taking the deposition.

A defendant not in custody shall have the right to be present at the examination upon request subject to such terms as may be fixed by the court, but his failure, absent good cause shown, to appear after notice and tender of expenses in accordance with §23A-12-3 shall constitute a waiver of that right and of any objection to the taking and use of the deposition based upon that right.\n\nSource:SL 1978, ch 178, §132.",
