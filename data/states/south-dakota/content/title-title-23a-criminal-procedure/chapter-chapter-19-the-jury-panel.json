Grounds for challenge to panel--Bias of officer summoning additional jurors.\n\nA challenge to a panel may only be based on a material departure from the procedure prescribed by law for the drawing and return of the jury, or on the intentional omission of the board of jury selectors or sheriff to summon one or more of the jurors drawn. However, if the panel is composed of any persons who were summoned to serve as jurors pursuant to §16-13-42, a challenge may be taken to the panel based upon the alleged bias of the officer who summoned them if such bias would be sufficient grounds for a challenge to an individual juror under § 23A-20-13.1. Such challenge must be determined in the same manner as if made to an individual juror for bias.\n\nSource:SDC 1939 & Supp 1960, §§34.3611, 34.3612; SDCL, §§23-43-11, 23-43-14; SL 1978, ch 178, §264; SL 2021, ch 86, § 4.",
