A defendant without counsel shall not be deemed to have consented to a continuance unless he has been advised by the court of his right to a speedy trial and the effect of his consent;\n\n(c)The period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the court at the request of the prosecuting attorney if the continuance is granted because of the unavailability of evidence material to the state's case, when the prosecuting attorney has exercised due diligence to obtain such evidence and there are reasonable grounds to believe that such evidence will be available at the later date and provided a written order is filed;\n\n(d)The period of delay resulting from the absence or unavailability of the defendant;\n\n(e)A reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and there is good cause for not granting a severance. In all other cases the defendant shall be granted a severance so that he may be tried within the time limits applicable to him;\n\n(f)The period of delay resulting from a change of judge or magistrate obtained by the defendant under chapter 15-12;\n\n(g)The period of delay during the declaration of a judicial emergency by the Supreme Court pursuant to chapter 16-3 which shall be retroactive to the date the judicial emergency is declared; and\n\n(h)Other periods of delay not specifically enumerated herein, but only if the court finds that they are for good cause. A motion for good cause need not be made within the one hundred eighty day period.\n\n(5) If a defendant is not brought to trial before the running of the time for trial, as extended by excluded periods, prejudice to the defendant is presumed. Unless the prosecuting attorney rebuts the presumption of prejudice, the defendant shall be entitled to a dismissal with prejudice of the offense charged and any other offense required by law to be joined with the offense charged.\n\nSource: Supreme Court Rule 85-4; SL 1991, ch 445 (Supreme Court Rule 91-11); SL 2012, ch 263 (Supreme Court Rule 12-09), eff.
