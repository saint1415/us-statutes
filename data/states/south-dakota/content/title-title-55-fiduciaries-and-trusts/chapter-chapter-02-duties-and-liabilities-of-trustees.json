Unless otherwise stated in the governing instrument, the direction of the trustor controls in the event of a conflict among written directions provided to the trustee pursuant to this section. The trustee incurs no liability for a loss or otherwise for relying upon the written directions, including an instance when the governing instrument of an irrevocable trust does not expressly authorize an expansion, restriction, or other modification of the rights of beneficiaries to information relating to a trust.\n\nThe terms of a trust instrument governing an irrevocable trust or written directions provided pursuant to this section may expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise vary the right of a beneficiary to be informed of the beneficiary's interest in a trust indefinitely or for a period of time, for example:\n\n(a)A period of time related to the age of a beneficiary;\n\n(b)A period of time related to the lifetime of either a trustor or spouse of a trustor, or both;\n\n(c)A period of time related to a term of years or specific date; and\n\n(d)A period of time related to a specific event that is certain to occur.\n\n(4)The terms of the governing instrument or written directions provided pursuant to this section may authorize either the trustor, trust advisor, or trust protector to appoint a representative as provided in subdivisions 55-18-9(11) and (12) for the purpose of being informed, on behalf of the beneficiary, of the beneficiary's interest in a trust for the period of time that the right of a beneficiary to be informed about a beneficiary's interest is restricted or eliminated pursuant to this section.\n\n(5)The written directions of the trustor, whether made in the governing instrument or by separate written directions made pursuant to the governing instrument or this section, control and remain in effect upon the death of the trustor until or unless modified or revoked by a trust advisor or trust protector as permitted by the governing instrument or the trustor's written directions in effect at the time of the trustor's death. Subject to subsection (3), the written directions of a trust advisor or trust protector remain in effect until or unless a trust advisor or trust protector revokes the written directions by providing a writing to that effect to the trustee.\n\n(6)Any beneficiary may waive the right to the notice or information otherwise required to be furnished under this section and, with respect to future reports and other information, may withdraw a waiver previously given.\n\n(7)Before providing information to any qualified beneficiary, a fiduciary may require that any such qualified beneficiary or beneficiaries be bound by the same duty of confidentiality that binds the fiduciary. If trust information is sought through service of a subpoena on a fiduciary, the fiduciary may petition the court for an order that makes disclosure of trust information contingent upon the receiving party being bound by reasonable conditions to ensure the protection of confidentiality of trust information by the receiving party.\n\n(8)The change in the identity of a trustee, occurring as the result of a mere name change or a merger, consolidation, combination, or reorganization of a trustee, does not require notice.\n\n(9)For the purposes of this section, the term, qualified beneficiary, means a beneficiary that is an entity then in existence or an individual who is twenty-one years of age or older and who, on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined:\n\n(a)Is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal;\n\n(b)Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the interests of the distributees terminated on that date; or\n\n(c)Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust terminated on that date.\n\nHowever, if the distributee is then unknown because a person holds a power to change the distributee, the trustee shall give notice only to the holder of the power.\n\n(10)For purposes of this section, the term, trust advisor, and the term, trust protector, are defined as provided in §55-1B-1.\n\n(11)The provisions of this section are effective for trusts created, amended, or restated after June 30, 2002, except as otherwise directed by the trustor, trust protector, trust advisor, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust. For trusts created before July 1, 2002, a trustee has no duty at common law or otherwise to notify a qualified beneficiary of the trust's existence unless otherwise directed by the trustor. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply if otherwise directed by the trustor, trust protector, trust advisor, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust.\n\nSource: SL 2002, ch 100, §15; SL 2007, ch 247, §8; SL 2008, ch 257, §10; SL 2009, ch 252, §16; SL 2010, ch 232, §1; SL 2011, ch 212, §8; SL 2017, ch 204, §17; SL 2017, ch 208, §30; SL 2018, ch 275, §25; SL 2020, ch 206, §12; SL 2023, ch 161, §7.",

Trustee authorized to distribute income or principal from first trust may appoint all or part in favor of trustee of second trust--Restrictions--Power of appointment to beneficiary of second trust.\n\nUnless the terms of the governing instrument expressly provide otherwise, if a trustee has discretion under the terms of a governing instrument to make a distribution of income or principal to or for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries of a trust (the \"first trust\"), whether or not restricted by any standard, then the trustee, independently or with court approval, may exercise such discretion by appointing part or all of the income or principal subject to the discretion in favor of a trustee of a second trust (the \"second trust\") under a governing instrument separate from the governing instrument of the first trust. Before exercising the discretion to appoint and distribute assets to a second trust, the trustee of the first trust shall determine whether the appointment is necessary or desirable after taking into account the purposes of the first trust, the terms and conditions of the second trust, and the consequences of the distribution.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a trustee of the first trust is a restricted trustee if either the trustee is a beneficiary of the first trust or if a beneficiary of the first trust has a power to change the trustees within the meaning of §55-2-17.\n\nIn addition, the following apply to all appointments made under this section:\n\n(1)The second trust may only have as beneficiaries one or more of the beneficiaries of the first trust:\n\n(a)To or for whom a discretionary distribution of income or principal may be made from the first trust;\n\n(b)To or for whom a distribution of income or principal may be made in the future from the first trust at a time or upon the happening of an event specified under the first trust; or\n\n(c)Both subsections (a) and (b);\n\n(2)No restricted trustee of the first trust may exercise such authority over the first trust to the extent that doing so could have the effect of:\n\n(a)Benefiting the restricted trustee as a beneficiary of the first trust, unless the exercise of such authority is limited by an ascertainable standard based on or related to health, education, maintenance, or support; or\n\n(b)Removing restrictions on discretionary distributions to a beneficiary imposed by the governing instrument under which the first trust was created, except that a provision in the second trust, which limits distributions by an ascertainable standard based on or related to the health, education, maintenance, or support of any such beneficiary, is permitted, or to a trust established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1396p(d)(4) (January 1, 2025);\n\n(3)No restricted trustee of the first trust may exercise such authority over the first trust to the extent that doing so would have the effect of increasing the distributions that can be made from the second trust to the restricted trustees of the first trust or to a beneficiary who may change the trustees of the first trust within the meaning of §55-2-17 compared to the distributions that can be made to such trustee or beneficiary, as the case may be, under the first trust, unless the exercise of such authority is limited by an ascertainable standard based on or related to health, education, maintenance, or support;\n\n(4)The provisions of subdivisions (2) and (3) only apply to restrict the authority of a trustee if either a trustee, or a beneficiary who may change the trustee, is a United States citizen or domiciliary under the Internal Revenue Code, or the trust owns property that would be subject to United States estate or gift taxes if owned directly by such a person;\n\n(5)In the case of any trust contributions that have been treated as gifts qualifying for the exclusion from gift tax described in §2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, by reason of the application of I.R.C. §2503(c), the governing instrument for the second trust must provide that the beneficiary's remainder interest shall vest no later than the date upon which such interest would have vested under the terms of the governing instrument for the first trust;\n\n(6)The exercise of such authority may not reduce any income interest of any income beneficiary of any of the following trusts:\n\n(a)A trust for which a marital deduction has been taken for federal tax purposes under I.R.C. §2056 or §2523 or for state tax purposes under any comparable provision of applicable state law;\n\n(b)A charitable remainder trust under I.R.C. §664; or\n\n(c)A grantor retained annuity or unitrust trust under I.R.C. §2702;\n\n(7)The exercise of such authority does not apply to trust property subject to a presently exercisable power of withdrawal held by a trust beneficiary to whom, or for the benefit of whom, the trustee has authority to make distributions, unless after the exercise of such authority, the beneficiary's power of withdrawal is unchanged with respect to the trust property;\n\n(8)The exercise of such authority is not prohibited by a spendthrift clause or by a provision in the governing instrument that prohibits amendment or revocation of the trust;\n\n(9)Any appointment made by a trustee is considered a distribution by the trustee pursuant to the trustee's distribution powers and authority; and\n\n(10)If the trustee's distribution discretion is not subject to a standard, or if the trustee's distribution discretion is subject to a standard that does not create a support interest, then the court may review the trustee's determination or any related appointment only pursuant to §55-1-43. Any other court review of the trustee's determination or any related appointment may be made only pursuant to §55-1-42.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the governing instrument of the second trust may grant a power of appointment to one or more of the beneficiaries of the second trust who are beneficiaries of the first trust. The power of appointment may include the power to appoint trust property to the holder of the power of appointment, the holder's creditors, the holder's estate, the creditors of the holder's estate, or any other person, whether or not the person is a trust beneficiary.\n\nA trustee’s power described in this section may be exercised by either an actual distribution of property to one or more second trusts or by modifying the terms of the first trust to create the second trust with or without an actual distribution. If the power is exercised by modifying the terms of the first trust, the trustee may:\n\n(1)Treat the second trust created by such modification as a new trust, in which case property of the first trust would be transferred to the second trust; or\n\n(2)Treat the second trust as a continuation of the first trust with respect for titling purposes, in which case property of the first trust would not need to be retitled.\n\nIn the case of an exercise of the power that is structured as a trustee's modification of the first trust, however, notwithstanding §55-2-18, the trustee shall provide not less than twenty days advance written notice to the qualified beneficiaries, applying chapter 55-18, unless the trustee receives written waivers of the notice from the qualified beneficiaries.\n\nThe trustee's power, which is described in and constrained by this section, remains separate and distinct from trust reformation under §§55-3-24 to 55-3-26, inclusive, or other provisions of law allowing trust modifications.\n\nThis section applies to any trust administered under the laws of this state, including a trust whose governing jurisdiction is transferred to this state.\n\nSource: SL 2007, ch 281, §1; SL 2008, ch 257, §11; SL 2009, ch 252, §17; SL 2011, ch 212, §10; SL 2012, ch 233, §4; SL 2013, ch 239, §16; SL 2017, ch 204, §18; SL 2021, ch 207, §4; SL 2025, ch 196, §6.",
