Trustor, trustee, beneficiary, power of appointment, and person defined.\n\nThe person whose confidence creates a trust is called the trustor; the person in whom the confidence is reposed is called the trustee; and the person for whose benefit the trust is created is called the beneficiary. As used in this title, except as specifically provided in chapters 55-13 and 55-13A, the term, beneficiary, means a person that has a present or future beneficial interest in a trust, vested or contingent. A person is not a beneficiary solely by reason of holding a power of appointment or by reason of the existence or exercise of a discretionary power described in §55-1-36.1 with respect to the person. As used in this title, except as provided in §55-1-26, the term, power of appointment, means a power, including a withdrawal power as defined in §55-1-24.2, to direct the disposition of trust property, but does not include the authority of a trustee to make a distribution to a beneficiary. A power of appointment is held by the person to whom the power has been given and once granted to a person, is not capable of appropriation or of manual delivery. A power of appointment is a general power of appointment if it is exercisable in favor of the person holding the power, the person's estate, the person's creditors, or the creditors of the person's estate, whether or not the power is also exercisable in favor of others. A power of appointment is a nongeneral power of appointment if it is not a general power of appointment. A holder of a general or nongeneral power of appointment may not be deemed a fiduciary unless otherwise provided for in the trust instrument. As used in this chapter, the term, person, has the meaning set forth in §55-4-1.\n\nSource:SDC 1939, §59.0103; SL 1998, ch 282, §40; SL 2015, ch 240, §9; SL 2016, ch 231, §9; SL 2021, ch 207, § 12.",

The appointed co-enforcer may serve only as long as the appointing enforcer serves, or as long as the last to serve if more than one enforcer appointed the co-enforcer. The appointed co-enforcer may not become a successor enforcer upon the death, resignation, or incapacity of the appointing enforcer, unless appointed under the terms of the governing instrument or unless no other successor enforcer, or method for appointing a successor enforcer, is provided in the governing instrument.\n\nThe powers and the responsibilities of the appointed co-enforcer may be limited by the appointing enforcer in a writing signed by the appointing enforcer at the time of the appointment. If the powers or responsibilities are so limited, the powers or responsibilities of the co-enforcer shall be limited as set forth in writing. Unless the powers or responsibilities are so limited, the appointed co-enforcer may exercise all the powers of the appointing enforcer. The combined powers of the appointed co-enforcer and the appointing enforcer may not exceed the powers of the appointing enforcer alone. The enforcer appointing a co-enforcer may, in writing, revoke the appointment at any time, with or without cause.\n\nUnless specifically restricted by the governing instrument, if the governing instrument gives a fiduciary other than the enforcer the power to remove and replace the enforcer, such power includes the power to appoint a co-enforcer to serve with the current enforcer.\n\nIf an appointment under this section confers upon the appointed co-enforcer, to the exclusion of another co-enforcer, the power to take certain actions, including the power to direct or prevent certain actions of the enforcers, the limitations on liability and the relief from duties and obligations afforded an excluded fiduciary under §55-1B-2 apply to a co-enforcer who does not hold such power.\n\nIf the governing instrument is silent concerning the enforcer's power to appoint a co-enforcer, the enforcer shall notify in writing, the trustor, if living, the current trustee or trustees, and any trust protector, trust advisors, and co-enforcers at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the enforcer's exercise of the power granted under this section. The notice, which shall include a copy of the proposed action, shall advise the trustor, the current trustee or trustees, trust protector, trust advisors, or co-enforcers that if they object to the enforcer's appointment, they need to file a written objection with the enforcer prior to the effective date set out in the notice of the proposed action. If an objection is received by the enforcer, prior to the effective date of the appointment, the enforcer may not appoint a co-enforcer. However, this section does not limit the power of the enforcer under law to petition the court for approval of the appointment. If no objection has been timely made, the proposed appointment becomes effective on the later of the date set out in the notice or thirty days after notice has been given. The notice shall be sent by any means allowed under the terms of the trust instrument or authorized in §55-2-24 to the trustor, the current trustee or trustees, trust protector, trust advisors, or co-enforcers.\n\nThe provisions of this section are effective for trusts created before, on, or after July 1, 2023, except as otherwise directed by the trustor, current trustee or trustees, trust protector, trust advisors, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust.\n\nSource: SL 2023, ch 161, §2.",

Registration of trust in court at principal place of administration.\n\nThe trustee of a trust that has its principal place of administration in this state may register the trust in the court of this state at the principal place of administration. Unless otherwise designated in the trust instrument, the principal place of administration of a trust is the trustee's place of business where the records pertaining to the trust are kept, or at the trustee's residence if the trustee has no such place of business. In the case of co-trustees, the principal place of administration, if not otherwise designated in the trust instrument, is:\n\n(1)The place of business of the corporate trustee if there is only one corporate co-trustee;\n\n(2)The place of business or residence of the individual trustee who is a professional fiduciary if there is only one such person and no corporate co-trustee; or\n\n(3)The place of business or residence of any of the co-trustees as agreed upon by the co-trustees.\n\nSource:SL 2017, ch 204, §8.",
