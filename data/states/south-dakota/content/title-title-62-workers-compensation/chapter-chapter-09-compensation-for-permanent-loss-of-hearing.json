Sound of an intensity of less than ninety decibels, \"A scale, slow response', is considered incapable of producing occupational hearing losses as defined in this chapter. Regular exposure to the noise levels set forth below for periods less than those described for such levels does not constitute an exposure to excessive noise:\n\nNoise LevelsPeriodsA Scale, Slow Response90 DB8 hours per day92 DB6 hours per day95 DB4 hours per day97 DB3 hours per day100 DB2 hours per day105 DB1 hour per day110 DB30 minutes per day115 DB15 minutes per dayGreater than 115 DBNo exposure recommended\n\nSource:SL 1986, ch 427, §2.",

Calculation of hearing loss--What loss is compensable.\n\nThe percentage of hearing loss shall be calculated as the average, in decibels, of the thresholds of hearing for the frequencies of five hundred, one thousand, two thousand and three thousand cycles per second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric instruments properly calibrated according to accepted national standards such as American Standards Association, Inc. (ASA), International Standards Organization (ISO), or American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), shall be used for measuring hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average twenty-five decibels ANSI or less in the four frequencies, such losses of hearing do not constitute any compensable hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average ninety-two decibels ANSI or more in the four frequencies, then the same shall constitute and be total or one hundred percent compensable hearing loss. In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest measured losses in each of the four frequencies shall be added together and divided by four to determine the average decibel loss. For each decibel of loss exceeding twenty-five decibels, an allowance of one and one-half percent shall be made up to the maximum of one hundred percent which is reached at ninety-two decibels.\n\nSource:SL 1986, ch 427, §3.",

The resulting figure shall be added to the percentage of loss determined in the same manner for the poorer ear and that sum shall be divided by six.
