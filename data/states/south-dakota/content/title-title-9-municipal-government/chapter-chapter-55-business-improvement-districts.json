Dissolution of district imposing occupational tax on rooms rented.\n\nIf a district has imposed an occupation tax based on rooms rented and the occupational tax revenue was used only for the promotion of the district, a majority of the landowners may dissolve the district established pursuant to §9-55-7 by submitting a petition to the governing body requesting the district to be dissolved. On and after the date the petition is filed with the governing body, the district may not enter into any new obligations or contracts. Not withstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the governing body, upon receiving the petition and verifying that a majority of the landowners have signed the petition, shall by resolution dissolve the district. However, the governing body may not dissolve the district until there are sufficient funds available to extinguish all of the debts and obligations of the district. The governing body shall administer any remaining affairs and issues concerning the dissolved district.\n\nSource:SL 2006, ch 35, §2.",
