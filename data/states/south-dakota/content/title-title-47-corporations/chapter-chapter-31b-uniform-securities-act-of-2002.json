Except while a stop order is in effect under §47-31B-306, a registration statement is effective for one year after its effective date, or for any longer period designated in an order under this chapter during which the security is being offered or distributed in a nonexempted transaction by or for the account of the issuer or other person on whose behalf the offering is being made or by an underwriter or broker- dealer that is still offering part of an unsold allotment or subscription taken as a participant in the distribution. For the purposes of a nonissuer transaction, all outstanding securities of the same class identified in the registration statement as a security registered under this chapter are considered to be registered while the registration statement is effective. If any securities of the same class are outstanding, a registration statement may not be withdrawn until one year after its effective date. A registration statement may be withdrawn only with the approval of the director. A fee of one hundred dollars is required for any extension of registration.\n\n(h) Periodic reports.

A consent to service of process complying with this section required by this chapter must be signed and filed in the form required by a rule or order under this chapter. A consent appointing the director the person's agent for service of process in a noncriminal action or proceeding against the person, or the person's successor or personal representative under this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter after the consent is filed, has the same force and validity as if the service were made personally on the person filing the consent. A person that has filed a consent complying with this subsection in connection with a previous application for registration or notice filing need not file an additional consent.\n\n(b) Conduct constituting appointment of agent for service. If a person, including a nonresident of this state, engages in an act, practice, or course of business prohibited or made actionable by this chapter or a rule adopted or order issued under this chapter and the person has not filed a consent to service of process under subsection (a), the act, practice, or course of business constitutes the appointment of the director as the person's agent for service of process in a noncriminal action or proceeding against the person or the person's successor or personal representative.\n\n(c) Procedure for service of process. Service under subsection (a) or (b) may be made by providing a copy of the process to the office of the director, but it is not effective unless:\n\n(1)The plaintiff, which may be the director, promptly sends notice of the service and a copy of the process, return receipt requested, to the defendant or respondent at the address set forth in the consent to service of process or, if a consent to service of process has not been filed, at the last known address, or takes other reasonable steps to give notice; and\n\n(2)The plaintiff files an affidavit of compliance with this subsection in the action or proceeding on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within the time that the court, or the director in a proceeding before the director, allows.\n\n(d) Service in administrative proceedings or civil actions by director. Service pursuant to subsection (c) may be used in a proceeding before the director or by the director in a civil action in which the director is the moving party.\n\n(e) Opportunity to defend. If process is served under subsection (c), the court, or the director in a proceeding before the director, shall order continuances as are necessary or appropriate to afford the defendant or respondent reasonable opportunity to defend.\n\nSource:SL 2004, ch 278, §49.",
