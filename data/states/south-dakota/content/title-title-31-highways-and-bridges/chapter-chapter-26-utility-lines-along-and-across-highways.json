The meeting shall allow the public entity and affected known utility to discuss options to minimize construction delays, limit the impact of the construction on utility facilities, and to minimize or eliminate costs associated with any utility removal or relocation. No such option may cause the public entity to incur additional costs unless a written agreement is reached to have the affected utility pay for the additional costs incurred by the public entity.\n\nIf the public entity determines that coordination meetings will not be held due to the project scope and size, the public entity shall notify any affected known utility and allow the affected utility thirty days to submit written comments on the project.\n\nAfter the coordination meetings or after the written comment period, the permit holder shall, upon ninety days notice in writing, remove or relocate the facilities at its own cost unless other arrangements have been mutually agreed upon in writing. If the public entity, in coordination with the utility, determines that winter weather conditions make removal or relocation impractical, the accrual of time within the ninety-day notification period shall be suspended until conditions make removal or relocation practical. If a utility's facility is discovered during construction that was not identified by the utility during the planning or design phase or during the written comment period if the public entity determines that a coordination meeting will not be held, the ninety-day notice is not required and the utility shall coordinate with the public entity to remove or relocate the facility as soon as practically possible for the project.\n\nSource:SL 1970, ch 166, §2; SL 2009, ch 148, §1.",

Upon application, the board of county commissioners may grant countywide authorization for the construction of rural water service lines or lines that water livestock, subject to the provisions of this chapter. The board of county commissioners may enact ordinances governing pipelines and grant authorization to the highway superintendent to approve rural water service lines without application to the board. County approval of a pipeline authorized under this section creates no ownership interest and is a temporary grant to utilize the highway.\n\nSource: SL 1977, ch 244, §1; SL 1979, ch 199, §§1, 2; SL 2023, ch 96, §1.",
