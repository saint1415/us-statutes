List of delinquent real property taxes compiled by county treasurer--Lands included--Information shown.\n\nThe treasurer of each county within this state may make a list of all taxes upon all real property in the county that appear from the tax records to be delinquent for a period of at least six years and that have not been satisfied by payment, or redemption, or sale of real estate, against which such taxes are assessed, to actual purchasers. The list shall include all such taxes upon any real estate that may at any tax sale have been bid in for the county, except real estate upon which the county holds school loans, and shall include all tax judgments against lands that have not been sold or bid off for the payment of the judgment. If a tax judgment stands against any such real estate, unsatisfied, the taxes and interest shall be computed as if the judgment had not been taken, and a sale of the real estate under the provisions of this chapter satisfies the judgment. The list shall contain a description of each piece or parcel of land and each lot, block, and addition, upon which taxes have not been paid as specified in this section. Opposite each description the name of the owner to whom the taxes are assessed, if known, shall be specified. If the name of the owner is unknown, a statement to that effect shall be provided. The year for which the taxes are delinquent shall be shown giving the year and the amount of tax for each year including the penalty and interest for each year and the total aggregate amount of all taxes delinquent and the penalty and interest.
