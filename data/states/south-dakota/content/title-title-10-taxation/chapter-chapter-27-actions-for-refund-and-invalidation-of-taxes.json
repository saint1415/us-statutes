However, this provision does not relieve the county and taxing districts involved from payment of interest to the person who may originally have paid the tax or any part of the tax to or for them if the county has been made a party to the action. The court's order may direct the deposit to be made within such time as the court deems just but not less than ten days nor more than ninety days may be allowed for the deposit.

The making of the deposit is not an admission, estoppel, or other legal conclusion for or against any party.
