Each check issued against insufficient funds or with no account or each delinquency is a separate incident and is subject to additional security in accordance with the schedule in this section. The increase in security shall remain in effect until the taxpayer has filed returns and remitted tax payments on time for twelve consecutive months; or\n\n(4)The cancellation of a bond by a surety or the withdrawal of security by a licensee.\n\nIn such cases, the secretary shall notify the licensee in writing of the increased or replacement security requirements. The licensee shall have thirty days from the date of written notification by the secretary to provide evidence of the replacement or supplemental security to the secretary. Failure of the licensee to provide such evidence shall be cause for the secretary to immediately cancel the license and send written notification of the cancellation to the licensee.
