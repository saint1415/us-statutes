Administrative Rules of South Dakota--Publication--Editorial authority--South Dakota Register--Supervision.\n\nThe Legislative Research Council shall publish on its website, from time to time, the Administrative Rules of South Dakota, containing permanent rules of general application promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. In preparing the text of the rules for publication, code counsel shall make changes necessary to correct apparent errors, to correlate and integrate all the rules, to harmonize, to assign a new title and other designation, and to eliminate or clarify obviously obsolete or ambiguous rules and rules declared invalid by the South Dakota Supreme Court or the United States Supreme Court. Code counsel may substitute terms or phraseology, and names of boards, commissions, and agencies, wherever the Legislature has expressly or by implication indicated an intention to do so. The publication may also contain information concerning executive orders, agreements made pursuant to chapter 1-24, agreements and changes made pursuant to chapter 1-32, and court rules, of permanent and general application that are not otherwise generally available to the public. The Legislative Research Council shall also publish at periodic intervals, the South Dakota Register, containing notices of hearings on proposed rules at least ten days prior to hearing, notices of rules filed in the secretary of state's office, and other information relating to agency and judicial rules and executive actions.\n\nCode counsel shall prepare the manuscripts for the rules and the register and supervise their publication.\n\nSource: SDC 1939, §65.0106; SL 1966, ch 159, §5 (1); SDCL §1-26-9; SL 1972, ch 8, §14; SL 1974, ch 16, §8; SL 1975, ch 16, §22; SL 1984, ch 9, §2; SL 1989, ch 16, §§13, 15; SL 2012, ch 8, §1; SL 2025, ch 9, §23.",
