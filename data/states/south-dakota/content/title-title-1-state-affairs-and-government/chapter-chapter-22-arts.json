Legislative findings and policy.\n\nThe South Dakota Legislature, being aware of the impact of culture on a stable economy, desires to stimulate, encourage, and give recognition and assistance to the arts which, in order to grow and flourish, depend upon freedom, imagination and individual initiative. While the development of the arts has long been considered a matter of local concern, there is a need to unify and coordinate these forces on a statewide basis. The arts, the creative spirit which motivates them and which they personify, are an essential part of this state's human resources. The best interest of the state and its people requires that artistic expression in all of its forms be disseminated for everyone to see, appreciate and enjoy in order for our cultural and economic progress to be sustained and given impetus.\n\nSource:SL 1966, ch 183, §1; SL 1985, ch 12, §1.",
