Legislative findings and intent.\n\nFor the benefit of the people of this state and the improvement of their health, welfare, safety, trade, commerce, industry, economy, and living conditions, it is essential that the people of this state have access, both geographically and financially, to adequate and affordable medical care and health facilities and it is essential that this and future generations of youth be given the fullest opportunity to learn and to develop their intellectual and mental capacities and it is essential that health institutions within the state and outside the state, subject to the limitations set forth in this chapter, and educational institutions within the state be provided with appropriate additional means to assist in the development and maintenance of public health and public education, respectively. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a measure of assistance and alternative methods to enable health institutions within the state and outside the state, subject to the limitations set forth in this chapter, and educational institutions in the state to refund or refinance outstanding indebtedness incurred for health facilities or educational facilities and to provide additional facilities and structures which are sorely needed to accomplish the purposes of this chapter, including securing access by the people of this state to adequate and affordable health care within this state and other states, all to the public benefit and good as more fully provided herein.\n\nIt is the intent of the Legislature, by the passage of this chapter, to create a state authority to lend money to health institutions and educational institutions and to authorize the state authority to acquire, construct, reconstruct, repair, alter, improve, extend, own, lease, and dispose of properties to the end that the state authority may be able to promote the health, welfare, safety, trade, commerce, industry, economy and education and welfare of the people of this state and to vest such state authority with all powers to enable such state authority to accomplish such purpose.\n\nIt is the further intent of the Legislature to provide a measure of assistance and alternative methods of financing to participating health institutions to aid them in providing needed health facilities that will assure admission and care of high quality and affordability to all who need it and to aid them in dealing with the cash requirements of such participating health institutions, whether resulting from capital expenditures, operating expenditures, delays in the receipt of payments for services, or otherwise.\n\nIt is the intent of the Legislature to ensure the availability of the most efficient and affordable financing alternatives to health institutions that are located outside this state but owned, operated, leased, or managed by, or otherwise affiliated with, health institutions located within this state, to promote the economy of this state and the access of the people of this state to adequate and affordable health care within this state and other states, all for the benefit of the health, welfare, safety, trade, commerce, industry, and economy of the people of this state.\n\nIt is not intended by this chapter that the state authority shall itself be authorized to operate any such health or educational facilities.\n\nIt is also determined that the availability of improved access to health professions schools will benefit the people of this state and improve their health, welfare, and living conditions and that the establishment of a health education loan bond program, with proceeds of bonds to be used for the purchase or making of loans to students, or certain former students, of health professions schools will enhance the availability of improved access to such schools and assist such persons in meeting the expenses incurred in availing themselves of health education opportunities.\n\nSource:SL 1972, ch 10, §1; SL 1982, ch 10, §1; SL 1994, ch 8, §1; SL 2004, ch 9, §1; SL 2020, ch 2, § 1.",
