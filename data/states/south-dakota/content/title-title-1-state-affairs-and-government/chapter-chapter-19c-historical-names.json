All state and local government agencies shall make changes to maps and any other reference materials to reflect the changes provided in this chapter. The use of the term, squaw, in whole or in part, is prohibited as a name for any geographic feature within this state.\n\nSource:SL 2001, ch 9, §1; SL 2009, ch 2, §2; SL 2014, ch 9, §1.",
