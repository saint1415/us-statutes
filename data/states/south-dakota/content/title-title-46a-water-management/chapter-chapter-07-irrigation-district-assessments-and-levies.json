Tax deed issued to district--Sale of land--Price.\n\nAfter the issuance of any such tax deed to an irrigation district, the directors may sell and convey the land so purchased, or any part of the land, at either public or private sale, whether or not the price received for the land equals the amount of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties, interest, and costs against the lands. However, if the lands are offered for sale at public sale, the directors may reject any bids on the lands, and no such lands may be sold by the directors at private sale until the lands have been offered for sale at public sale, nor at a price less than the highest price bid for the lands at the public sale at which the lands were offered. If no bid is received for the lands when the lands are offered for public sale, the directors may then sell the lands in such manner and for such price as they deem to be in the best interests of the district.\n\nSource:SDC 1939, §61.0915; SDCL §46-15-43; SL 2011, ch 165, §437.",
