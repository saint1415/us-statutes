The expansion will allow Teach for America to positively impact two-thirds of the Native American students on reservations in the state and more than half of the Native American students statewide, and to strengthen its efforts to improve the academic achievement of low-income, Native American students and to increase the educational opportunities afforded them.\n\nFunding through the grant program shall be provided to Teach for America over a period of four fiscal years beginning on July 1, 2012. The amount of the grants provided pursuant to this section and §13-55-63 shall be based upon the amount of matching funds received by Teach for America from private contributors, but the total amount of all grants provided may not exceed the total amount of money appropriated for the grant fund.\n\nSource:SL 2012, ch 103, §1, eff.
