School fiscal year--Local board to set length of school term, day and week--Number of hours in school term.\n\nThe school fiscal year shall begin July first and end June thirtieth. Each local school board shall set the number of days in a school term, the length of a school day, and the number of school days in a school week. The local school board or governing body shall establish the number of hours in the school term for kindergarten programs, which may not be less than four hundred thirty-seven and one-half hours. The number of hours in the school term for grades one through five may not be less than eight hundred seventy-five hours, exclusive of intermissions. The number of hours in the school term for grades six through twelve may not be less than nine hundred sixty-two and one-half hours, exclusive of intermissions. An intermission is the time when students are at recess or lunch and for grades six through twelve, the passing time between classes.\n\nThe minimum number of hours required in this section may be waived by the secretary if the Governor or the President of the United States declares a state of emergency and the affected school is located within the area to which the state of emergency is applicable. The Department of Education shall monitor emergency-related school closures and provide updates to the schools.\n\nDuring a declared state of emergency, the school district shall forward to the Department of Education, at the time and in the manner requested by the department, a record of the continuous instruction provided to the students. The department shall consider the nature and scope of the instruction provided to determine whether it will count towards the minimum number of hours required in a school term.\n\nSource:SDC 1939, § 15.3002; SL 1949, ch 58; SL 1955, ch 41, ch 12, § 8; SDC Supp 1960, § 15.3008; SL 1978, ch 110, § 1; SL 1979, ch 117, § 1; SL 2000, ch 80, § 1; SL 2006, ch 80, § 2, eff.

The school board shall operate grades one through twelve for at least a nine-month regular term in any one school year, and the number of hours in a school term for kindergarten shall be set pursuant to §13-26-1. The regular school term may be conducted on a year-round basis and shall begin on a date established by the school board. The Board of Education Standards shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 governing the operation and scheduling of year-round schools. Any school board or governing body may release graduating high school seniors from school before the end of the regular term. A school is not required to make up time for school closing because of weather, disease, or emergency once it has reached the minimum number of hours in the school term as required by state law. Graduating seniors are excused from make up time if the make up time occurs after the students have graduated or after graduation exercises have been held. If classes have been convened and then are dismissed, or if classes convene at a time later in the day than normal, because of inclement weather, that day constitutes a school day in session equal to the number of hours planned for that day as established in the local school district calendar for the year.\n\nSchool boards are encouraged to provide time within the regular school term for curriculum and staff development which shall be in addition to the time required in this section. Each school board shall determine the appropriate amount of time for this activity and how best to use the time based on local needs for program development, increased parent participation, student contact, teachers' preparation, or other needs of the schools in the district. School is in session only when classes are held and as provided in §§13-26-4 and 13-26-4.1. A school board may operate a special term during the summer months.\n\nSource:SDC 1939, §15.3003; SL 1955, ch 41, ch 12, §9; SDC Supp 1960, §15.3009; SL 1963, ch 83; SL 1979, ch 117, §2; SL 1984, ch 118; SL 1985, ch 129, §1; SL 1986, ch 122, §§1, 2; SL 1990, ch 122, §9; SL 1990, ch 124; SL 1991, ch 140; SL 1991, ch 141; SL 1992, ch 127; SL 1993, ch 133, §1; SL 1993, ch 134; SL 1994, ch 120, §1; SL 1996, ch 113, §§1, 2; SL 1996, ch 114, §1; SL 1997, ch 92, §1; SL 1997, ch 93, §1; SL 2000, ch 80, §2; SL 2001, ch 83, §1; SL 2004, ch 127, §1; SL 2004, ch 128, §1; SL 2010, ch 87, §1; SL 2017, ch 81, §57.",
