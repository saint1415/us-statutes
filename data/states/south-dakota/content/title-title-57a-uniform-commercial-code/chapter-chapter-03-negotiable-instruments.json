Definitions.\n\n(a) In this chapter:\n\n(1)\"Acceptor\" means a drawee who has accepted a draft.\n\n(2)\"Drawee\" means a person ordered in a draft to make payment.\n\n(3)\"Drawer\" means a person who signs or is identified in a draft as a person ordering payment.\n\n(4)(Reserved.)\n\n(5)\"Maker\" means a person who signs or is identified in a note as a person undertaking to pay.\n\n(6)\"Order\" means a written instruction to pay money signed by the person giving the instruction. The instruction may be addressed to any person, including the person giving the instruction, or to one or more persons jointly or in the alternative but not in succession.

In the case of a bank that takes an instrument for processing for collection or payment by automated means, reasonable commercial standards do not require the bank to examine the instrument if the failure to examine does not violate the bank's prescribed procedures and the bank's procedures do not vary unreasonably from general banking usage not disapproved by this chapter or chapter 57A-4.\n\n(8)\"Party\" means a party to an instrument.\n\n(9)\"Promise\" means a written undertaking to pay money signed by the person undertaking to pay. An acknowledgment of an obligation by the obligor is not a promise unless the obligor also undertakes to pay the obligation.\n\n(10)\"Prove\" with respect to a fact means to meet the burden of establishing the fact (§57A-1-201(8)).\n\n(11)\"Remitter\" means a person who purchases an instrument from its issuer if the instrument is payable to an identified person other than the purchaser.\n\n(b) Other definitions applying to this chapter and the sections in which they appear are:\n\n\"Acceptance\" §57A-3-409\n\n\"Accommodated party\" §57A-3-419\n\n\"Accommodation party\" §57A-3-419\n\n\"Alteration\" §57A-3-407\n\n\"Anomalous indorsement\" §57A-3-205\n\n\"Blank indorsement\" §57A-3-205\n\n\"Cashier's check\" §57A-3-104\n\n\"Certificate of deposit\" §57A-3-104\n\n\"Certified check\" §57A-3-409\n\n\"Check\" §57A-3-104\n\n\"Consideration\" §57A-3-303\n\n\"Draft\" §57A-3-104\n\n\"Holder in due course\" §57A-3-302\n\n\"Incomplete instrument\" §57A-3-115\n\n\"Indorsement\" §57A-3-204\n\n\"Indorser\" §57A-3-204\n\n\"Instrument\" §57A-3-104\n\n\"Issue\" §57A-3-105\n\n\"Issuer\" §57A-3-105\n\n\"Negotiable instrument\" §57A-3-104\n\n\"Negotiation\" §57A-3-201\n\n\"Note\" §57A-3-104\n\n\"Payable at a definite time\" §57A-3-108\n\n\"Payable on demand\" §57A-3-108\n\n\"Payable to bearer\" §57A-3-109\n\n\"Payable to order\" §57A-3-109\n\n\"Payment\" §57A-3-602\n\n\"Person entitled to enforce\" §57A-3-301\n\n\"Presentment\" §57A-3-501\n\n\"Reacquisition\" §57A-3-207\n\n\"Special indorsement\" §57A-3-205\n\n\"Teller's check\" §57A-3-104\n\n\"Transfer of instrument\" §57A-3-203\n\n\"Traveler's check\" §57A-3-104\n\n\"Value\" §57A-3-303\n\n(c) The following definitions in other chapters apply to this chapter:\n\n\"Bank\" §57A-4-105\n\n\"Banking day\" §57A-4-104\n\n\"Clearing house\" §57A-4-104\n\n\"Collecting bank\" §57A-4-105\n\n\"Depositary bank\" §57A-4-105\n\n\"Documentary draft\" §57A-4-104\n\n\"Intermediary bank\" §57A-4-105\n\n\"Item\" §57A-4-104\n\n\"Payor bank\" §57A-4-105\n\n\"Suspends payments\" §57A-4-104\n\n(d) In addition, chapter 57A-1 contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this chapter.\n\nSource:SL 1994, ch 367, §3-103; SL 2008, ch 259, §35.",

If an instrument falls within the definition of both \"note\" and \"draft,\" a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.\n\n(f) \"Check\" means (i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank or (ii) a cashier's check or teller's check.

A reference to another writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.\n\n(b) A promise or order is not made conditional (i) by a reference to another writing for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration, or (ii) because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.\n\n(c) If a promise or order requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or order conditional for the purposes of §57A-3-104(a). If the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.\n\n(d) If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of §57A-3-104(a); but if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.\n\nSource:SL 1994, ch 367, §3-106.",

Identification of person to whom instrument is payable.\n\n(a) The person to whom an instrument is initially payable is determined by the intent of the person, whether or not authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of the instrument. The instrument is payable to the person intended by the signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other identification that is not that of the intended person. If more than one person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to any person intended by one or more of the signers.\n\n(b) If the signature of the issuer of an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing machine, the payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied the name or identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.\n\n(c) A person to whom an instrument is payable may be identified in any way, including by name, identifying number, office, or account number. For the purpose of determining the holder of an instrument, the following rules apply:\n\n(1)If an instrument is payable to an account and the account is identified only by number, the instrument is payable to the person to whom the account is payable.

If an instrument is payable to two or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced only by all of them. If an instrument payable to two or more persons is ambiguous as to whether it is payable to the persons alternatively, the instrument is payable to the persons alternatively. For the purposes of this subsection, the term, instrument, includes a writing that would otherwise qualify as a certificate of deposit but for the fact that the writing contains a limitation on transfer.\n\nSource:SL 1994, ch 367, §3-110; SL 1997, ch 281, §2.",

Discharge of indorsers and accommodation parties.\n\n(a) In this section, the term \"indorser\" includes a drawer having the obligation described in §57A-3-414(d).\n\n(b) Discharge, under §57A-3-604, of the obligation of a party to pay an instrument does not discharge the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the discharged party.\n\n(c) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to an extension of the due date of the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the extension discharges an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the party whose obligation is extended to the extent the indorser or accommodation party proves that the extension caused loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse.\n\n(d) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to a material modification of the obligation of a party other than an extension of the due date, the modification discharges the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the person whose obligation is modified to the extent the modification causes loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse. The loss suffered by the indorser or accommodation party as a result of the modification is equal to the amount of the right of recourse unless the person enforcing the instrument proves that no loss was caused by the modification or that the loss caused by the modification was an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse.\n\n(e) If the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is secured by an interest in collateral and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the obligor is discharged to the extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in collateral is impaired to the extent (i) the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse of the party asserting discharge, or (ii) the reduction in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the right of recourse exceeds the value of the interest. The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge.\n\n(f) If the obligation of a party is secured by an interest in collateral not provided by an accommodation party and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of any party who is jointly and severally liable with respect to the secured obligation is discharged to the extent the impairment causes the party asserting discharge to pay more than that party would have been obliged to pay, taking into account rights of contribution, if impairment had not occurred. If the party asserting discharge is an accommodation party not entitled to discharge under subsection (e), the party is deemed to have a right to contribution based on joint and several liability rather than a right to reimbursement. The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge.\n\n(g) Under subsection (e) or (f), impairing value of an interest in collateral includes (i) failure to obtain or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral, (ii) release of collateral without substitution of collateral of equal value, (iii) failure to perform a duty to preserve the value of collateral owed, under article 9 or other law, to a debtor or surety or other person secondarily liable, or (iv) failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of collateral.\n\n(h) An accommodation party is not discharged under subsection (c), (d), or (e) unless the person entitled to enforce the instrument knows of the accommodation or has notice under §57A-3-419(c) that the instrument was signed for accommodation.\n\n(i) A party is not discharged under this section if (i) the party asserting discharge consents to the event or conduct that is the basis of the discharge, or (ii) the instrument or a separate agreement of the party provides for waiver of discharge under this section either specifically or by general language indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral.\n\nSource:SL 1994, ch 367, §3-605.",
