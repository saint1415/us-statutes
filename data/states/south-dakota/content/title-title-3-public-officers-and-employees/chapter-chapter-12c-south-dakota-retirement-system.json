If the board adopts a select and ultimate rate of interest, the interest rate is the ultimate rate. Mortality is based on a unisex rate that is fifty percent male and fifty percent female for employees and beneficiaries, based on the mortality rates for retired employees and beneficiaries, including, if the board adopts a generational mortality table, a generational projection of mortality improvement with the member's and beneficiary's ages as of the date of the calculation assumed to be in the calendar year in which the plan year containing the date of the calculation begins. If the board adopts distinct mortality tables for the different categories of retired members or beneficiaries, the mortality rates must be based on a weighted blend of the tables with the weighting based on the percentage of accrued benefits for each category of members as the actuarial valuation immediately preceding the date of adoption of the mortality tables.

Final average compensation for foundation members whose contributory service concluded before July 1, 2021.\n\nFor any foundation member whose contributory service concluded before July 1, 2021, the term, final average compensation, means the highest average annual compensation earned by a member during any period of twelve consecutive calendar quarters during the member's last forty calendar quarters of membership in the system including time during which the member was not a member but for which the member has received credit under the system.\n\nFor purposes of determining final average compensation if periods of contributory service are separated by breaks, any service earned from covered employment may be aggregated to constitute a period of twelve consecutive calendar quarters. For any member who has less than twelve but more than four calendar quarters of membership in the system, the member's final average compensation shall be based on the compensation received in all quarters of membership. For any member who has four calendar quarters of membership or less, the member's final average compensation shall be based on the member's annual compensation.\n\nSource:SL 2016, ch 32, §26; SL 2017, ch 29, §1; SDCL §3-12-89.4; SL 2019, ch 22, §1.",

For the purpose of paying a distribution, the variable retirement account is the amount in the member's variable retirement account or the total of the variable retirement contributions made on behalf of the member, whichever is greater.\n\nThe variable retirement account may be paid in a lump sum, rolled over to the South Dakota deferred compensation plan, rolled over to another eligible plan, or used to purchase a supplemental pension benefit.\n\nThe variable retirement account is not payable to any member who withdraws his or her accumulated contributions from the system.\n\nSource: SL 2016, ch 32, §23; SDCL §3-12-521; SL 2019, ch 22, §1; SL 2022, ch 15, §8; SL 2023, ch 14, §6.",

Qualified benefit preservations arrangement--Establishment--Purpose.\n\nThe qualified benefit preservation arrangement is established and placed under the management of the board. The purpose of the qualified benefit preservation arrangement is solely to provide a portion of the benefit that would otherwise have been payable by the system except for the limitations under section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as determined in §3-12C-1805. The qualified benefit preservation arrangement is intended to constitute a qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement under section 415(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall be interpreted and construed consistently with that intent. The qualified benefit preservation arrangement is a portion of the system solely to the extent required under, and within the meaning of, code section 415(m)(3) and §3-12C-1805.\n\nThe qualified benefit preservation arrangement is an exempt governmental deferred compensation plan described in code section 3121(v)(3). Code sections 83, 402(b), 457(a) and 457(f)(1) do not apply to the qualified benefit preservation arrangement. With respect to code section 457(a), the maximum amount that may be deferred under the qualified benefit preservation arrangement on behalf of any participant for the taxable year may exceed both the amount in code section 457(b)(2), as adjusted for cost of living increases, and the percent of the participant's includible compensation referred to in that code section. The system may not hold any assets or income under the qualified benefit preservation arrangement in trust for the exclusive benefit of participants.\n\nSource:  SL 2020, ch 14, § 3.",
