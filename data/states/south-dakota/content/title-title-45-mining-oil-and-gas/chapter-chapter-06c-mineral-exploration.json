Legislative findings and policy.\n\nThe relatively unknown and as yet largely undeveloped mineral resources of this state consist in major proportion of minerals below the surface. The exploration for and discovery of these minerals by means of drilling and other methods of detecting mineral deposits are necessary for the economic development of the state and the nation. Every effort should be used to promote and encourage the exploration for mineral resources, but to prevent the waste and spoilage of the land which would deny its future use and productivity. It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that:\n\n(1)Upon completion of an exploration operation the affected land is usable and productive to the extent possible for agricultural or recreational pursuits or future resource development; and\n\n(2)Both during and after an exploration operation, water and other natural resources are not endangered.\n\nSource:SL 1982, ch 306, §2.",

The term does not include those activities which cause very little or no surface disturbance, such as exploration by auger or drill of test holes of less than fifty feet in depth and less than seven inches in diameter for sand, limestone, gypsum, shale, or iron ore for use in the process of making cement or nonexplosive seismic energy sources, airborne surveys and photographs, augered bentonite or augered construction aggregate test holes of less than fifty feet in depth when accomplished in conformance with §§45-6C-28 and 45-6C-32, use of instruments or devices which are hand carried or otherwise transported over the surface to make magnetic, radioactive, or other tests and measurements, boundary or claim surveying, location work, annual assessment work required to maintain the validity of a mineral claim or any other work which causes no greater land disturbance than is caused by ordinary lawful use of the land by persons not exploring for mineral deposits;\n\n(7)\"Mineral,\" any substance with economic value, whether organic or inorganic, that can be extracted from the earth, including oil and gas, but excluding uranium and water;\n\n(8)\"Operator,\" any person, firm, partnership, limited liability company, association or corporation, or any department, division, or agency of federal, state, county, or municipal government engaged in or controlling a mineral exploration operation;\n\n(9)\"Reclamation,\" the employment during and after an exploration operation of procedures reasonably designed to minimize the disruption from the exploration operation and to provide for the rehabilitation of plant cover, soil stability, water resources, or other measures appropriate to the subsequent beneficial use of such explored land;\n\n(10)\"Test hole,\" a well, core hole, core test, observation well, or other well drilled from the surface to determine the presence of mineral, mineral resource, ore, coal, or rock unit, or to obtain geological or geophysical information or other subsurface data, including holes drilled for purposes of seismic survey, but excluding drilling in conjunction with mining or quarry operations and structural foundations and oil and gas wells regulated pursuant to chapter 45-9.\n\nSource: SL 1982, ch 306, §3; SL 1985, ch 341; SL 1990, ch 354, §1; SL 1991, ch 17 (Ex.
