Legislative findings and policy.\n\nThe relatively unknown and as yet largely undeveloped uranium resources of this state consist in major proportion of uranium below the surface. The exploration for and discovery of uranium by means of drilling and other methods of detecting such deposits are important to the economic development of the state and the nation. Every effort should be used to prevent the waste and spoilage of the land which would deny its future use and productivity. Proper safeguards must be provided by the state to ensure that the health and safety of the people are not endangered and that upon completion of a uranium exploration operation the affected land is usable and productive to the extent possible for agricultural or recreational pursuits or future resource development; that both during and after a uranium exploration operation, water and other natural resources are not endangered; and that esthetics and a tax base are maintained, all for the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the state.\n\nSource:SL 1982, ch 307, §2.",
