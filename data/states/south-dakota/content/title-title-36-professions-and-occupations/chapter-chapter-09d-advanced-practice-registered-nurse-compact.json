The procedures must include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by an applicant, for the purpose of obtaining the applicant’s criminal background information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining the state's criminal records.\n\nEach party state shall require that an applicant satisfy the following uniform licensure requirements to obtain, or retain, a multistate license:\n\n(1)Meet the home state’s qualifications for licensure or renewal of licensure, and all other applicable state laws;\n\n(2)Complete:\n\n(a)An accredited graduate-level education program that prepares the applicant for one of the four recognized roles and population foci; or\n\n(b)A foreign advanced practice registered nurse education program for one of the four recognized roles and population foci that has been approved by the authorized accrediting body in the applicable country and verified by an independent credentials review agency to be comparable to a licensing board-approved advanced practice registered nurse education program;\n\n(3)If a graduate of a foreign advanced practice registered nurse education program that was not taught in English or if English is not the applicant's native language, successfully pass an English proficiency examination that includes reading, speaking, writing, and listening;\n\n(4)Pass a national certification examination that measures advanced practice registered nurse roles and population-focused competencies, and maintains continued competence, as evidenced by recertification in the role and population focused competencies, through the national certification program;\n\n(5)Holds an active, unencumbered license as a registered nurse and an active, unencumbered authorization to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse;\n\n(6)Passes an NCLEX-RN® examination or a recognized predecessor of that examination;\n\n(7)Practice at least 2,080 hours as an advanced practice registered nurse, in a role and population focus congruent with the applicant’s education and training, provided that for purposes of this subdivision, practice does not include hours obtained as part of enrollment in an advanced practice registered nurse education program;\n\n(8)Submits, in connection with an application for initial licensure or licensure by endorsement, fingerprints or other biometric data for the purpose of obtaining criminal background information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining the state's criminal records or, if applicable, the foreign country’s criminal records;\n\n(9)Has not been convicted of, found guilty of, or entered into an agreed disposition of, a felony offense under applicable state, federal, or foreign criminal law;\n\n(10)Has not been convicted of, found guilty of, or entered into an agreed disposition of, a misdemeanor offense related to the practice of nursing, as determined by factors set forth in rules adopted by the commission;\n\n(11)Is not enrolled in an alternative program;\n\n(12)Is subject to self-disclosure requirements regarding current participation in an alternative program; and\n\n(13)Has a valid United States Social Security number.\n\nAn advanced practice registered nurse issued a multistate license must be licensed in an approved role and at least one approved population focus.\n\nAn advanced practice registered nurse multistate license issued by a home state to a resident of the state must be recognized by each party state, as authorizing the advanced practice registered nurse to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse in each party state, under a multistate licensure privilege, in the same role and population focus as the advanced practice registered nurse is licensed in the home state.\n\nNothing in this Compact affects the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license, except that an individual may apply for a single-state license, instead of a multistate license, even if otherwise qualified for the multistate license. The failure of an individual to affirmatively opt for a single-state license may result in the issuance of a multistate license.\n\nIssuance of an advanced practice registered nurse multistate license includes prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs.\n\nFor each state in which an advanced practice registered nurse seeks authority to prescribe controlled substances, the advanced practice registered nurse shall satisfy the requirements imposed by the state in granting, or as applicable, in renewing such authority.\n\nAn advanced practice registered nurse issued a multistate license may assume responsibility and accountability for patient care, independently of any supervisory or collaborative relationship. This authority may be exercised in the home state and in any remote state in which the advanced practice registered nurse exercises a multistate licensure privilege.\n\nEach party state may, in accordance with state due process laws, take adverse action against an advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate licensure privilege. If a party state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Compact, an advanced practice registered nurse practicing in a party state shall comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. Advanced practice is not limited to patient care. It may include all advanced nursing practice, as defined by the practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. Practice in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject the advanced practice registered nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Compact, this Compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing. A multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state must be recognized by other party states as satisfying any state law requirement for registered nurse licensure, as a precondition for authorization to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse in that state.\n\nAn individual not residing in a party state may apply for a party state’s single-state advanced practice registered nurse license, as provided under the laws of each party state. A single-state license granted to such an individual does not grant the privilege to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse in any other party state.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR ADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED NURSE LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE\n\nUpon application for an advanced practice registered nurse multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the holder of a licensed practical or vocational nursing license, a registered nursing license, or an advanced practice registered nurse license, issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.\n\nAn advanced practice registered nurse may hold a multistate advanced practice registered nurse license, issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.\n\nIf an advanced practice registered nurse changes the nurse's home state, the advanced practice registered nurse must apply for advanced practice registered nurse licensure in the nurse's new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state must be deactivated, in accordance with applicable rules of the commission.\n\nAn advanced practice registered nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in the nurse's home state.\n\nA multistate advanced practice registered nurse license may not be issued by the new home state until the advanced practice registered nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate advanced practice registered nurse license from the new home state.\n\nIf an advanced practice registered nurse moves from a party state to a non-party state, the advanced practice registered nurse multistate license issued by the prior home state converts to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.\n\nADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN PARTY STATE LICENSING BOARDS\n\nIn addition to other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board may:\n\n(1)Take adverse action against an advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state, provided:\n\n(a)Only the home state may take adverse action against an advanced practice registered nurse’s license issued by the home state; and\n\n(b)For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct that occurred outside of the home state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state, and in so doing, the home state shall apply its state laws to determine appropriate action;\n\n(2)Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an advanced practice registered nurse’s authority to practice within that party state;\n\n(3)Complete any pending investigations of an advanced practice registered nurse who changes the nurse's state of residence during the course of an investigation, take appropriate action, and promptly report the conclusions of an investigation to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, who shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions;\n\n(4)Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence, provided:\n\n(a)Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing board for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state must be enforced in the latter state by a court of competent jurisdiction, according to that court’s practice and procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings; and\n\n(b)The licensing board issuing a subpoena shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located;\n\n(5)For an advanced practice registered nurse licensure applicant, obtain and submit fingerprints or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal history checks, receive the results from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and use the results in making licensure decisions;\n\n(6)If permitted by state law, recover from the affected advanced practice registered nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against the advanced practice registered nurse; and\n\n(7)Take adverse action based on the factual findings of another party state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.\n\nIf adverse action is taken by a home state against an advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate licensure, the privilege to practice in all other party states under a multistate licensure privilege is deactivated, until all encumbrances have been removed from the advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate license must include a statement that the advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.\n\nNothing in this Compact overrides a party state’s decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any advanced practice registered nurse for the duration of the advanced practice registered nurse’s participation in an alternative program.\n\nCOORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION\n\nAll party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all advanced practice registered nurses, licensed registered nurses, and licensed practical or vocational nurses. This system must include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each advanced practice registered nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordinated administration of advanced practice registered nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.\n\nThe commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate procedures for the identification, collection, and exchange of information under this Compact.\n\nEach licensing board shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications and the reason for the denials, and advanced practice registered nurse participation in an alternative program known to the licensing board, regardless of whether the participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.\n\nNotwithstanding any other law, any party state licensing board contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to others without the permission of the contributing state.\n\nAny personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board may not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to others, except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.\n\nAny information that is contributed to the coordinated licensure information system and subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing the information must be removed from the coordinated licensure information system.\n\nThe Compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the Compact administrator of each other party state, which must include:\n\n(1)Identifying information;\n\n(2)Licensure data;\n\n(3)Information related to alternative program participation; and\n\n(4)Information that may facilitate the administration of this Compact, as determined by rules of the commission.\n\nThe Compact administrator of a party state shall provide all investigative documents and information requested by another party state.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION OF ADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED NURSE COMPACT ADMINISTRATORS\n\nThe party states hereby create and establish a joint public agency known as the Interstate Commission of Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Compact Administrators.\n\nThe commission is an instrumentality of the party states.\n\nVenue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.\n\nNothing in this Compact may be construed to waive sovereign immunity.\n\nEach party state shall have one administrator. The head of the state licensing board or a designee is the administrator of this Compact for each party state. An administrator may be removed or suspended from office, as provided by the law of the state from which the administrator is appointed.

All documents considered in connection with an action must be identified in the minutes. All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the commission or by court order.\n\nThe commission shall, by a majority vote of the administrators, prescribe bylaws or rules to govern its conduct, as necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and exercise the powers of this Compact, including: establishing the fiscal year of the commission; providing reasonable standards and procedures for the establishment and meetings of committees and for the general or specific delegation of any authority or function of the commission; establishing procedures for calling and conducting meetings of the commission, ensuring advance notice of all meetings, and providing an opportunity for attendance at meetings by interested parties, with enumerated exceptions designed to protect the public’s interest, the privacy of individuals, and proprietary information, including trade secrets.\n\nThe commission may meet in closed session only after a majority of the administrators vote to close a meeting, in whole or in part. As soon as practicable, the commission shall make public a copy of the vote to close the meeting, revealing the vote of each administrator. No proxy votes are allowed.\n\nThe commission shall, by a majority vote of the administrators, establish the titles, duties, and authority and procedures for the election of the commission's officers; and provide standards and procedures for the establishment of personnel policies and programs of the commission.

Rules and amendments become binding as of the date specified in each and have the same force and effect as provisions of this Compact.\n\nRules and amendments to the rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.\n\nBefore promulgation and adoption of a final rule or any rule by the commission, and at least sixty days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking on the commission's website and on the website of each licensing board or in the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.\n\nThe notice of proposed rulemaking must include:\n\n(1)The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;\n\n(2)The text of the proposed rule, and the reason for the proposed rule;\n\n(3)A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and\n\n(4)The manner in which a person may submit notice to the commission of the person's intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.\n\nBefore the adoption of a proposed rule or amendment, the commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which must be made available to the public.\n\nThe commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment.\n\nThe commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the public hearing. A public hearing must be conducted in a manner that provides each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing. Each hearing must be recorded, and a copy of the recording must be made available upon request.\n\nNothing in this Article requires a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped, at hearings required by this section, for the convenience of the commission.\n\nIf no one appears at the public hearing, the commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule.\n\nFollowing the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.\n\nThe commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.\n\nUpon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this Compact and in this section are retroactively applied to the rule, as soon as reasonably possible, but not later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately, in order to meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare, prevent a loss of commission or party state moneys, or meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by federal law or regulation.\n\nThe commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in formatting, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions must be posted on the website of the commission. A revision may be challenged by any person for a period of thirty days after the revision is posted. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made in writing, and delivered to the commission, before the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision takes effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.\n\nOVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ENFORCEMENT\n\nEach party state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this Compact’s purposes and intent.\n\nThe commission may receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission, and has standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission renders a judgment or order void as to the commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.\n\nIf the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or under the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action to be taken by the commission and shall provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\nIf a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state’s membership in the Compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n\nTermination of membership in this Compact may be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of the intent to suspend or terminate membership must be given by the commission to the Governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state’s licensing board, the defaulting state’s licensing board, and each of the party states.\n\nA state whose membership in this Compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n\nThe commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this Compact has been terminated, unless agreed upon, in writing, between the commission and the defaulting state.\n\nA defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\nAt the request of a party state, the commission shall attempt to resolve a dispute that is related to the Compact and which arises among party states or between party and non-party states.\n\nThe commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.\n\nIf the commission cannot resolve a dispute among party states arising under this Compact, the party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, comprised of individuals appointed by the Compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the Compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute. A decision by a majority of the arbitrators is final and binding.\n\nThe commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.\n\nTo enforce compliance with this Compact, its bylaws, and rules promulgated under this Compact, against a party state that is in default, the commission may, by majority vote, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\nThe remedies provided for in this Article are not the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND AMENDMENT\n\nWhen enacted into law, in seven party states, this Compact becomes effective for the limited purpose of establishing and convening the commission to adopt rules related to its operation.\n\nAny state that joins the Compact after the commission’s initial adoption of the advanced practice registered nurse uniform licensure requirements is subject to all rules that have been previously adopted by the commission.\n\nA party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute that repeals the Compact. A party state’s withdrawal is not effective until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n\nA party state’s withdrawal or termination does not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state’s licensing board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring prior to the effective date of the withdrawal or termination.\n\nNothing contained in this Compact invalidates or prevents any advanced practice registered nurse licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a non-party state, provided the agreement or arrangement does not conflict with this Compact.\n\nThis Compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to this Compact is effective and binding upon any party state until it is enacted into law by all the party states. Representatives of non-party states to this Compact shall be invited to participate in the activities of the commission, on a nonvoting basis, prior to the adoption of this Compact by all states.\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n\nThis Compact must be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this Compact are severable and, if any portion of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or if the applicability thereof, to any government, agency, person, or circumstance, is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and its applicability is not affected.\n\nIf this Compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this Compact must remain in full force and effect, as to the remaining party states, and in full force and effect as to the party state affected, as to all severable matters.\n\nSource: SL 2024, ch 156, §1.",
