Encourage the cooperation of member states in regulating multi-state occupational therapy practice;\n\nD.Support spouses of relocating military members;\n\nE.Enhance the exchange of licensure, investigative, and disciplinary information between member states;\n\nF.Allow a remote state to hold a provider of services with a compact privilege in that state accountable to that state’s practice standards; and\n\nG.Facilitate the use of telehealth technology for the purpose of increasing access to occupational therapy services.\n\nSource: SL 2023, ch 139, §2.",
