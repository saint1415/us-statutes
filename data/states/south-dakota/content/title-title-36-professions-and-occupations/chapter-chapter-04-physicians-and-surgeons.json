The compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing Medical Practice Act. The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the compact.\n\nSECTION 2: DEFINITIONS\n\nIn this compact:\n\n(a)\"Bylaws\" means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission pursuant to section 11 for its governance, or for directing and controlling its actions and conduct.\n\n(b)\"Commissioner\" means the voting representative appointed by each member board pursuant to section 11.\n\n(c)\"Conviction\" means a finding by a court that an individual is guilty of a criminal offense through adjudication, or entry of a plea of guilt or no contest to the charge by the offender.

A member board may terminate the automatic suspension of the license it issued prior to the completion of the ninety day suspension period in a manner consistent with the Medical Practice Act of that state.SECTION 11: INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION(a) The member states hereby create the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Commission.(b) The purpose of the Interstate Commission is the administration of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, which is a discretionary state function.(c) The Interstate Commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the member states and shall have all the responsibilities, powers, and duties set forth in the compact, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by a subsequent concurrent action of the respective legislatures of the member states in accordance with the terms of the compact.(d) The Interstate Commission shall consist of two voting representatives appointed by each member state who shall serve as commissioners.

The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.\n\n(b) The Interstate Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same.\n\n(c) The Interstate Commission shall not pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by, and with the authority of, the member state.\n\n(d) The Interstate Commission shall be subject to a yearly financial audit conducted by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in the annual report of the Interstate Commission.\n\nSECTION 14: ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\n(a) The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of commissioners present and voting, adopt bylaws to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the compact within twelve months of the first Interstate Commission meeting.\n\n(b) The Interstate Commission shall elect or appoint annually from among its commissioners a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson, or in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice-chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission.\n\n(c) Officers selected in subsection (b) shall serve without remuneration from the Interstate Commission.\n\n(d) The officers and employees of the Interstate Commission shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of, or relating to, an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.\n\n(1)The liability of the executive director and employees of the Interstate Commission or representatives of the Interstate Commission, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within such person's state, may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. The Interstate Commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.\n\n(2)The Interstate Commission shall defend the executive director, its employees, and subject to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an Interstate Commission representative, shall defend such Interstate Commission representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person.\n\n(3)To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state, or the Interstate Commission, the representatives or employees of the Interstate Commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorney's fees and costs, obtained against such persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.\n\nSECTION 15: RULE-MAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\n(a) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate Commission exercises its rule-making authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.\n\n(b) Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the Interstate Commission shall be made pursuant to a rule-making process that substantially conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 2010, and subsequent amendments thereto.\n\n(c) Not later than thirty days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority granted to the Interstate Commission.\n\nSECTION 16: OVERSIGHT OF INTERSTATE COMPACT\n\n(a) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of the compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law but shall not override existing state authority to regulate the practice of medicine.\n\n(b) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of the compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission.\n\n(c) The Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, the compact, or promulgated rules.\n\nSECTION 17: ENFORCEMENT OF INTERSTATE COMPACT\n\n(a) The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the compact.\n\n(b) The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the commissioners, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, and its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\n(c) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.\n\nSECTION 18: DEFAULT PROCEDURES\n\n(a) The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a member state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by the compact, or the rules and bylaws of the Interstate Commission promulgated under the compact.\n\n(b) If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission shall:\n\n(1)Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default; and\n\n(2)Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n\n(c) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by the compact shall terminate on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.\n\n(d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's Legislature, and each of the member states.\n\n(e) The Interstate Commission shall establish rules and procedures to address licenses and physicians that are materially impacted by the termination of a member state, or the withdrawal of a member state.\n\n(f) The member state which has been terminated is responsible for all dues, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n(g) The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n(h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nSECTION 19: DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n(a) The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states or member boards.\n\n(b) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate rules providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution as appropriate.\n\nSECTION 20: MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT\n\n(a) Any state is eligible to become a member state of the compact.\n\n(b) The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than seven states. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding on a state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state.\n\n(c) The Governors of nonmember states, or their designees, shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states.\n\n(d) The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states.\n\nSECTION 21: WITHDRAWAL\n\n(a) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state; provided that a member state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.\n\n(b) Withdrawal from the compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the Governor of each other member state.\n\n(c) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing the compact in the withdrawing state.\n\n(d) The Interstate Commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt of notice provided under subsection (c).\n\n(e) The withdrawing state is responsible for all dues, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n(f) Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.\n\n(g) The Interstate Commission is authorized to develop rules to address the impact of the withdrawal of a member state on licenses granted in other member states to physicians who designated the withdrawing member state as the state of principal license.\n\nSECTION 22: DISSOLUTION\n\n(a) The compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the compact to one member state.\n\n(b) Upon the dissolution of the compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\n\nSECTION 23: SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\n(a) The provisions of the compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\n(b) The provisions of the compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n\n(c) Nothing in the compact shall be construed to prohibit the applicability of other interstate compacts to which the states are members.\n\nSECTION 24: BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\n(a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.\n\n(b) All laws in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\n(c) All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the commission, are binding upon the member states.\n\n(d) All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\n(e) In the event any provision of the compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the Legislature of any member state, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state.\n\nSource:SL 2015, ch 198, §1.",
