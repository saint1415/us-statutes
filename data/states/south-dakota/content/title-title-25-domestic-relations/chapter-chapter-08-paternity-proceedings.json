Actions contesting rebuttable presumption of paternity.\n\nAny action contesting a rebuttable presumption of paternity as established by §§25-8-50 to 25-8-58, inclusive, shall be commenced in circuit court either sixty days after the creation of the presumption of paternity or the date of any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the child including proceedings to establish a support obligation in accordance with §25-8-52, whichever occurs earlier, except in a case where there are allegations of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. In a case involving allegations of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, any action contesting a rebuttable presumption of paternity shall be commenced within three years after the creation of any presumption. The burden of proof shall be upon the moving party and the payment of child support, or any other legal responsibilities of the parties, may not be suspended during the pendency of the proceedings, except upon a showing of good cause by the moving party.

Setting aside presumption or prior determination of paternity based on genetic test results--Factors in determining best interest of the child.\n\nThe court may at any time before the child turns eighteen, find that a presumed or legally determined father is not the biological father of a child, based on genetic test results that either exclude the presumed or legally determined father as the biological father of the child or establish another person as the biological father of the child by the standards set in §25-8-58. The court may under such circumstances set aside a presumption or prior determination of paternity if it finds that setting aside a presumption or prior determination of paternity is in the best interest of the child. The court may consider any of the following factors in determining the best interests of the child:\n\n(1)The length of time between the proceeding to adjudicate parentage and the time that the presumed or legally determined father was placed on notice that he might not be the genetic father;\n\n(2)The length of time during which the presumed or legally determined father has assumed the role of father of the child;\n\n(3)The facts surrounding the presumed or legally determined father's discovery of his possible nonpaternity;\n\n(4)The nature of the relationship between the child and the presumed or legally determined father;\n\n(5)The age of the child;\n\n(6)The harm or benefit that may result to the child if the presumed or legally determined paternity is successfully disproved;\n\n(7)The nature of the relationship between the child and any presumed or legally determined father;\n\n(8)The extent to which the passage of time reduces the chances of establishing the paternity of another man and a child-support obligation in favor of the child; and\n\n(9)Any additional factors deemed by the court to be relevant to its determination of the best interest of the child.\n\nSource:SL 2013, ch 119, §18.",
