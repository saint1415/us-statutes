Parenting coordinators should conduct themselves according to the following general principles:\n\n(1)A parenting coordinator should recognize that success is based on participation and self-determination by the parties. A parenting coordinator shall conduct any session fairly, diligently, impartially and in a manner consistent with assisting the parties under the direction of the court's order and in the best interests of the children.\n\n(2)A parenting coordinator shall fully disclose to all parties involved any actual or potential conflict of interest. A parenting coordinator shall not accept or shall withdraw from any matter in which the parenting coordinator has reason to believe he or she cannot proceed in an impartial manner. After full disclosure of an actual or potential conflict of interest to the parties, the parenting coordinator shall withdraw from the case if requested by any party to do so within ten days of the disclosure.\n\n(3)A parenting coordinator shall maintain impartiality in the process of parenting coordination. Impartiality means freedom from favoritism or bias in word, action or appearance, and includes a commitment to assist all parties, as opposed to any one individual. A parenting coordinator shall withdraw if the parenting coordinator determines he or she cannot act in an impartial or objective manner.\n\n(4)A parenting coordinator shall not provide any other professional services to either party or the minor children while serving as a parenting coordinator. A parenting coordinator shall also ensure that any prior history of involvement with the parties does not conflict with the role of parenting coordinator, and shall not assume a role subsequent to acting as parenting coordinator which conflicts with the prior role of parenting coordinator.\n\n(5)Incidents of suspected child or adult abuse or neglect that meet the mandatory reporting standards under South Dakota law shall be reported by the Parenting Coordinator to the appropriate authorities.\n\n(6)A parenting coordinator should make a conscious effort to recognize violence or abuse by or against the parties or children. A parenting coordinator shall consider the safety of all involved when structuring the parenting coordination process and may recommend that parenting coordination is not appropriate for the parties.\n\nSource:SL 2013, ch 268, §10 (Supreme Court Rule 13-07), eff.
