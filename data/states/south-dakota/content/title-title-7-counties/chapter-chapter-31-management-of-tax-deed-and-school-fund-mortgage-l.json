Such classification shall be based on the method of sale and leasing which will be followed in managing county-owned land.

The classification shall list the various tracts of county-owned land that are designated class one land and the tracts that are designated as class two land and the general plan of leasing and management that is to be followed including the general type of leases and the standards and criteria that are to be followed in leasing class two land. The classification becomes effective by resolution of the board of county commissioners duly made and entered of record and thereafter the board may proceed in administration and management of the two classes of land as provided herein. The classification of any tract may be changed in the same manner that the original classification was made provided that tracts classified as class two land may not be reclassified as class one land, except at the termination of every five-year period from the date of original classification or at the termination of the lease on said tracts.
