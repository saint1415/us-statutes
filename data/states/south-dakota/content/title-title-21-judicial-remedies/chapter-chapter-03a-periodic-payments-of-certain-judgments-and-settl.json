If any portion of future damages is payable in advance of the period to which it applies in satisfaction of the agreement, the amount of the damages is subject to discount in accordance with §21-3A-9.\n\n(b)Upon election of a subrogee, including an employer or insurer who provides workers' compensation, filed within the time permitted by rule of court, any part of future damages allocable to reimbursement of payments previously made by the subrogee is payable in lump sum to the subrogee and the appropriate reduction of future damages shall be calculated in accordance with §21-3A-9.\n\n(c)The court shall enter judgment in lump sum for past damages and for any damages payable in lump sum or otherwise under subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b).

If the lump-sum equivalent of the total is more than fifty thousand dollars, each beneficiary shall be paid in periodic installments in accordance with §21-3A-1.2.\n\n(4)Upon petition of a party before entry of judgment and a finding of incapacity to post the required security, the court, at the election of the claimant or beneficiaries in an action for wrongful death, shall:\n\n(a)Enter a judgment in accordance with subdivision (3); or\n\n(b)Reduce the amounts payable for future damages in accordance with §21-3A-9, unless subdivision 21-3A-8(1) applies, to determine the equivalent lump-sum value and enter judgment for that amount plus the amounts found for past damages.\n\nSource:SL 1986, ch 163, §5; SL 1988, ch 181, §3.",
