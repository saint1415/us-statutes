If you agree to this voluntary foreclosure you will be giving up your right to redeem your real estate.\n\nUnder foreclosure law, if your mortgage lender does not receive enough money to cover what you owe when the property is sold, you could be required to pay the deficiency. If your mortgage lender receives more money than you owe, the difference must be paid to you. If you agree to this voluntary foreclosure you will not have to pay any deficiency but you also will not be paid any excess, if any.\n\nNOTE: There may be other advantages and disadvantages, including an effect on your income tax liability. If you have any question or doubts, you are encouraged to obtain competent advice.\n\nYou may cancel this transaction, without penalty or obligation, within five business days from the above date.\n\nThis transaction is entirely voluntary. You cannot be required to sign the attached foreclosure agreement.\n\nThis voluntary foreclosure agreement will become final unless you sign and deliver or mail this notice of cancellation to\n\n__________________ before midnight of __________________\n\n(name of mortgagee) (enter proper date).\n\nI HEREBY CANCEL THIS TRANSACTION.\n\n______________________________ _____________________________________\n\nDATE SIGNATURE\"\n\nSource:SL 1991, ch 185, §1.",
