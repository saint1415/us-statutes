Any person who intentionally conceals or withholds such property from the sheriff or constable is liable to double damages at the suit of the party injured;\n\n(4)Until the judgment against the defendant has been paid, the sheriff or constable shall collect the evidences of debt that may have been seized or attached by virtue of the writ of attachment, and prosecute any bond he may have taken in the course of such proceedings, and apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of the judgment and costs. When the judgment and all costs of the proceedings have been paid, the sheriff or constable, upon reasonable demand, shall deliver the residue of the property attached, or the proceeds thereof, to the defendant.\n\nSource:SL 1983, ch 168, §28.",
