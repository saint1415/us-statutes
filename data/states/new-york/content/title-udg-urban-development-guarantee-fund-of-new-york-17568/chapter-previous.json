      "text": "found and declared that there exists in urban areas of this state a\ncondition of substantial and persistent unemployment and underemployment\nwhich causes hardship to many individuals and families, wastes vital\nhuman resources, increases the public assistance burdens of the state\nand municipalities, impairs the security of family life, contributes to\nthe growth of crime and delinquency, prevents many of our youth from\nfinishing their educations, impedes the economic and physical\ndevelopment of municipalities and adversely affects the welfare and\nprosperity of all the people of the state. Many existing industrial,\nmanufacturing and commercial facilities in such urban areas are obsolete\nand inefficient, dilapidated, and without adequate mass transportation\nfacilities and public services. Many of such facilities are\nunderutilized or in the process of being vacated, creating additional\nunemployment. Technological advances and the provision of modern,\nefficient facilities in other states will speed the obsolescence and\nabandonment of existing facilities causing serious injury to the economy\nof the state. Many existing and planned industrial, manufacturing and\ncommercial facilities are, moreover, far from or not easily accessible\nto the places of residence of substantial numbers of unemployed persons.\nAs a result, problems of chronic unemployment are not being alleviated\nbut are aggravated. New industrial, manufacturing and commercial\nfacilities are required to attract and house new industries and thereby\nto reduce the hazards of unemployment. The unaided efforts of private\nenterprise have not met and cannot meet the needs of providing such\nfacilities due to problems encountered in assembling suitable building\nsites, lack of adequate public services, the unavailability of private\ncapital for development in such urban areas, and the inability of\nprivate enterprise alone to plan, finance and coordinate industrial and\ncommercial development with residential developments for persons and\nfamilies of low income and with public services and mass transportation\nfacilities.",

The legislature finds that vast areas of rural New York state\nshow signs of severe economic distress and lag behind the rest of the\nstate in employment growth and income, with the gap widening with\npassing years. Poverty in many rural areas is pervasive, with the poor\noften outnumbering the affluent.The legislature further finds that rural communities in New York state\nneed immediate assistance to develop the capacity to plan and organize\nfor economic development, to undertake new economic development\ninitiatives, to overcome obstacles to economic development and to fully\nutilize indigenous resources to provide rural residents with economic\nopportunities.The legislature further finds that, to begin to address these needs, a\ncatalyst is needed to stimulate and encourage innovative economic\ndevelopment alternatives to declining employment in the agricultural and\nmanufacturing sectors.The legislature further finds that, while agriculture is considered to\nbe a major New York industry, state economic development financing\nprograms do not treat agriculture as an industrial sector, and financing\nis not available to provide farmers with assistance to become more\ncompetitive in national and international markets.Therefore, the legislature declares that the revitalization of the\nstate's rural economy is essential to New York's economic health and\nthat state assistance in this regard is necessary and proper for\nachieving this public purpose.2.

Any such service contract or other agreements shall\nprovide that the obligation of the director of the budget or of the\nstate to fund or to pay the amounts therein provided for shall not\nconstitute a debt of the state within the meaning of any constitutional\nor statutory provision and shall be deemed executory only to the extent\nmoneys are available and that no liability shall be incurred by the\nstate beyond the moneys available for such purpose, and that such\nobligation is subject to annual appropriation by the legislature.(h) Any service contract or other agreements entered into pursuant to\nparagraph (g) of this subdivision or any payments made or to be made\nthereunder may be assigned and pledged by the dormitory authority of the\nstate of New York and/or the urban development corporation as security\nfor any related payment obligation it may have with one or more\nfinancial institutions in connection with a line of credit facility\nauthorized by paragraph (b) of this subdivision.(i) In addition to the foregoing, the director of the budget, the\ndormitory authority of the state of New York and the urban development\ncorporation shall each be authorized to enter into such other agreements\nand to take or cause to be taken such additional actions as are\nnecessary or desirable to effectuate the purposes of the transactions\ncontemplated by a line of credit facility and the related service\ncontract.(j) No later than seven days after a draw occurs on the line of credit\nfacility, the director of the budget shall provide notification of such\ndraw to the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the\nassembly.(k) The authorization, establishment and use by the dormitory\nauthority of the state of New York and the urban development corporation\nof a line of credit facility authorized by paragraph (b) of this\nsubdivision, and the execution, sale and issuance of state personal\nincome tax revenue bonds and/or state service contract bonds to\nrefinance any such line of credit facility shall not be deemed an\naction, as such term is defined in article 8 of the environmental\nconservation law, for the purposes of such article. Such exemption shall\nbe strictly limited in its application to such financing activities of\nthe dormitory authority of the state of New York and the urban\ndevelopment corporation undertaken pursuant to this section and does not\nexempt any other entity from compliance with such article.(l) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the\nabilities of the director of the budget and the authorized issuers of\nstate-supported debt to perform their respective obligations on existing\nservice contracts or other agreements entered into prior to April 1,\n2020.2.
