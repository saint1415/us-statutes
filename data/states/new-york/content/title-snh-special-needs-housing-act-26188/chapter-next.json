The suspensions authorized hereunder shall continue until one\nyear after the date of the order and, to the extent of any determination\nof the board that a continuation of such suspensions, to a date\nspecified by the board, is necessary in order to achieve the objectives\nof the financial plan, such suspensions shall be continued to the date\nspecified by such board, which date shall in no event be later than the\nend of the emergency period, provided that such suspensions shall\nterminate with respect to employees who have agreed to a deferral of\nsalary or wage increase upon the certification of the agreement by the\nboard pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision.2. This subdivision shall not be applicable to employees of the city\nor employees of a covered organization covered by a collective\nbargaining agreement or an employee of the city or a covered\norganization not covered by a collective bargaining agreement where the\ncollective bargaining representative or such unrepresented employee has\nagreed to a deferment of salary or wage increase, by an instrument in\nwriting which has been certified by the supervisory board as being an\nacceptable and appropriate contribution toward alleviating the fiscal\ncrisis of the city. Any such agreement to a deferment of salary or wage\nincrease may provide that for the purposes of computing the pension base\nof retirement allowances, any deferred salary or wage increase may be\nconsidered as part of compensation or final compensation or of annual\nsalary earned or earnable.3. The supervisory board may, if it finds that the fiscal crisis has\nbeen sufficiently alleviated or for any other appropriate reason, direct\nthat the suspensions of salary or wage increases or suspensions of other\nincreased payments or benefits shall, in whole or in part, be\nterminated.(l) 1. Notwithstanding the provisions or limitations of any law,\ngeneral, special or local, including the charter of the city of Troy, an\nimpasse panel, arbitrator, collective bargaining board, fact finding or\nsimilar type of panel, body or individual which is authorized to\nrecommend or award an increase in wages or fringe benefits to any\nemployee of the city or covered organization shall, in addition to\nconsidering any standard or factor required to be considered by\napplicable law, also take into consideration and accord substantial\nweight to the financial ability of the city or covered organization to\npay the cost of such increase in wages or fringe benefits.2. Any determination pursuant to article 8 of the labor law or any\nagreement or stipulation entered into in lieu thereof which provides for\nan increase in wages or fringe benefits of any employee of the city or\ncovered organization shall, in addition to considering any standard or\nfactor required to be considered by applicable law, also take into\nconsideration and accord substantial weight to the financial ability of\nthe city or covered organization to pay the cost of such increase in\nwages or fringe benefits.3. Any party to a proceeding before a panel, body or individual as\ndescribed in paragraph one or two of this subdivision may commence a\nspecial proceeding in the appellate division, third department, supreme\ncourt, state of New York, to review the determination as to the city or\ncovered organization's financial ability to pay. Such proceeding shall\nbe commenced not later than thirty days after the final determination\nhas been made by the panel, body or individual. Such proceeding shall\nhave preference over all other cases in such appellate division, other\nthan cases relating to the election law.4. The court shall make a de novo review of the record solely for the\npurpose of determining whether an award of an increase in wages or\nfringe benefits was within the city's or covered organization's\nfinancial ability to pay. The court's findings as to such issue shall be\nbased upon a preponderance of all the evidence set forth in the record.\nUnless the parties stipulate otherwise, arguments or submission shall be\nhad within fifteen days after commencement of the special proceeding and\nthe court shall render its decision within fifteen days thereafter. All\nquestions, other than the question relating to the determination, shall\nbe reviewed by the appellate division in the same proceeding in the\nmanner provided by article 75 or 78 of the civil practice law and rules\nas may be appropriate, notwithstanding that the issue would otherwise\nhave been cognizable in the first instance before a special or trial\nterm of the supreme court. If an appeal shall otherwise lie from such\ndetermination of the appellate division to the court of appeals, notice\nof such appeal shall be filed within thirty days after the entry of the\nfinal order or judgment of the appellate division if such appeal is of\nright or within ten days after entry of an order granting leave to\nappeal, and such appeal shall have preference over all other appeals\nother than appeals relating to the election law.5. At any stage of any proceeding under paragraph one, two or three of\nthis subdivision or any appeal from an order or judgment therefrom the\nsupervisory board may intervene as a party on the issue of the financial\nability of the city or covered organization to pay the cost of an\nincrease in wages or fringe benefits.6. For the purposes of this subdivision, financial ability to pay\nshall mean the financial ability of the city or covered organization to\npay the cost of any increase in wages or fringe benefits without\nrequiring an increase in the level of city taxes as approved in the\nfinancial plan of the city in effect at the time of the commencement of\na proceeding under paragraph one or two of this subdivision.§ 10-a. Prohibition; penalties. (a) During any emergency period (i) no\nofficer or employee of the city of Troy or of any of the covered\norganizations shall make or authorize an obligation or other liability\nin excess of the amount available therefor under the financial plan as\nthen in effect; (ii) no officer or employee of the city of Troy or of\nany of the covered organizations shall involve the city of Troy or any\nof the covered organizations in any contract or other obligation or\nliability for the payment of money for any purpose required to be\napproved by the supervisory board unless such contract has been so\napproved and unless such contract or obligation or liability is in\ncompliance with the financial plan as then in effect.(b) No officer or employee of the city of Troy or any of the covered\norganizations shall take any action in violation of any valid order of\nthe supervisory board or shall fail or refuse to take any action\nrequired by any such order or shall prepare, present or certify any\ninformation (including any projections or estimates) or report for the\nsupervisory board or any of its agents that is false or misleading, or,\nupon learning that any such information is false or misleading, shall\nfail promptly to advise the supervisory board or its agents thereof.(c) In addition to any penalty or liability under any other law, any\nofficer or employees of the city of Troy or any of the covered\norganizations who shall violate subdivision (a) or (b) of this section\nshall be subject to appropriate administrative discipline, including,\nwhen circumstances warrant, suspension from duty without pay or removal\nfrom office by order of either the governor or the chief executive\nofficer; and any officer or employee of the city of Troy or any of the\ncovered organizations who shall knowingly and willfully violate\nsubdivision (a) or (b) of this section shall, upon conviction, be guilty\nof a misdemeanor.(d) In the case of a violation of subdivision (a) or (b) of this\nsection by an officer or employee of the city of Troy or any of the\ncovered organizations, the chief executive officer or the chief\nexecutive officer of such covered organization shall immediately report\nto the supervisory board all pertinent facts together with a statement\nof the action taken thereon.§ 11. If any clause, sentence, subdivision, paragraph, section or part\nof this act be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be\ninvalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the\nremainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause,\nsentence, subdivision, paragraph, section or part thereof directly\ninvolved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been\nrendered.",
