An expanded construction\nprogram is essential to relieve overcrowding in the state hospitals for\nthe mentally ill, to provide treatment and care for the increasing\npopulation of people with developmental disabilities in state schools,\nand to permit the establishment of special treatment programs for\nmentally ill and emotionally disturbed children and for the mentally ill\nblind and the mentally ill deaf. Existing state facilities require\nsubstantial modernization and structural change to accommodate new\nconcepts of treatment for the mentally disabled and special units for\nthe treatment of alcoholism and narcotics addiction. Larger and better\nequipped research facilities must be installed in order to insure that\nstate treatment units are in the forefront of applying and developing\nadvanced therapeutic methods. At the same time, improved training\nfacilities and quarters are needed to attract and retain the\nbest-qualified staff personnel.",
