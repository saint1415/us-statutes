If for any of the purposes of this act (including temporary\nconstruction purposes, and the making of additions or improvements to\nbridges or tunnels already constructed), the port authority shall find\nit necessary or convenient to acquire any real property as herein\ndefined, whether for immediate or future use, the port authority may\nfind and determine that such property, whether a fee simple absolute or\na lesser interest, is required for a public use, and upon such\ndetermination, the said property shall be and shall be deemed to be\nrequired for such public use until otherwise determined by the port\nauthority; and with the exceptions hereinafter specifically noted, the\nsaid determination shall not be affected by the fact that such property\nhas theretofore been taken for, or is then devoted to, a public use; but\nthe public use in the hands or under the control of the port authority\nshall be deemed superior to the public use in the hands of any other\nperson, association or corporation.The port authority may acquire and is hereby authorized to acquire\nsuch property, whether a fee simple absolute or a lesser interest, by\nthe exercise of the right of eminent domain under and pursuant to the\nprovisions of the eminent domain procedure law of the state of New York,\nin the case of property located in such state, and revised statutes of\nNew Jersey, Title 20:1-1 et seq., in the case of property located in\nsuch state, or at the option of the port authority as provided in\nsection fifteen of chapter forty-three of the laws of New Jersey of\nnineteen hundred forty-seven, as amended, for the condemnation of real\nproperty for air terminal purposes, in the case of property located in\nsuch state, or pursuant to such other and alternate procedure as may be\nprovided by law.Where a person entitled to an award in the proceedings to acquire any\nreal property for any of the purposes of this act, remains in possession\nof such property after the time of the vesting of title in the port\nauthority, the reasonable value of his use and occupancy of such\nproperty subsequent to such time, as fixed by agreement or by the court\nin such proceedings or by any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be\na lien against such award, subject only to liens of record at the time\nof the vesting of title in the port authority.Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit the port\nauthority from bringing any proceedings to remove a cloud on title or\nsuch other proceedings as it may, in its discretion, deem proper and\nnecessary, or from acquiring any such property by negotiation or\npurchase.§ 16. Anything in this act to the contrary notwithstanding, no\nproperty now or hereafter vested in or held by any county, city,\nborough, village, township or other municipality shall be taken by the\nport authority, without the authority or consent of such county, city,\nborough, village, township or other municipality as provided in said\ncompact of April thirty, nineteen hundred twenty-one, provided that the\nstate in which such county, city, borough, village, township or other\nmunicipality is located may authorize such property to be taken by the\nport authority by condemnation or the exercise of the right of eminent\ndomain without such authority or consent; nor shall anything herein\nimpair or invalidate in any way any bonded indebtedness of the state, or\nsuch county, city, borough, village, township or other municipality, nor\nimpair the provisions of law regulating the payment into sinking funds\nof revenue derived from municipal property, or dedicating the revenues\nderived from municipal property, to a specific purpose. The port\nauthority is hereby authorized and empowered to acquire from any such\ncounty, city, borough, village, township or other municipality, or from\nany other public agency or commission having jurisdiction in the\npremises, by agreement therewith, and such county, city, borough,\nvillage, township, municipality, public agency or commission,\nnotwithstanding any contrary provision of law, is hereby authorized and\nempowered to grant and convey upon reasonable terms and conditions, any\nreal property, which may be necessary for the construction, operation\nand maintenance of such bridges and tunnels, including such real\nproperty as has already been devoted to a public use. Each of the two\nsaid states hereby consent to the use and occupation of the real\nproperty of such state necessary for the construction, operation and\nmaintenance of bridges and tunnels constructed or operated pursuant to\nthe provisions of this act, including lands of the state lying under\nwater.§ 17.

The term \"real property\" as used in this act is defined to\ninclude lands, structures, franchises, and interests in land, including\nlands under water and riparian rights, and any and all things and rights\nusually included within the said term, and includes not only fees simple\nabsolute but also any and all lesser interests, such as easements,\nrights of way, uses, leases, licenses and all other incorporeal\nhereditaments and every estate, interest or right, legal or equitable,\nincluding terms of years, and liens thereon by way of judgments,\nmortgages or otherwise, and also claims for damage to real estate.§ 20. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize or\npermit the port authority to undertake the construction of any vehicular\nbridge or tunnel over or under the Arthur Kill, unless or until adequate\nprovision has been made by law for the protection of those advancing\nmoney upon the obligations of the port authority for the construction of\nthe bridges mentioned in chapter two hundred and ten of the laws of\nnineteen hundred twenty-five, or the construction of any vehicular\nbridge or tunnel over or under the Hudson river, at or north of Sixtieth\nstreet in the borough of Manhattan, city of New York, unless or until\nadequate provision has been made by law for the protection of those\nadvancing money upon the obligations of the port authority for the\nconstruction of the bridge mentioned in chapter seven hundred and\nsixty-one of the laws of nineteen hundred twenty-six, or the\nconstruction of any vehicular bridge or tunnel over or under the Kill\nvan Kull unless or until adequate provision has been made by law for the\nprotection of those advancing money upon the obligations of the port\nauthority for the construction of the bridge mentioned in chapter three\nhundred of the laws of nineteen hundred twenty-seven.§ 21. This section and the preceding sections hereof, except section\neighteen, constitute an agreement between the states of New York and New\nJersey supplementary to the compact between the two states dated April\nthirty, nineteen hundred twenty-one, and amendatory thereof, and shall\nbe liberally construed to effectuate the purposes of said compact and of\nthe comprehensive plan heretofore adopted by the two states, and any\npowers granted to the port authority by this act shall be deemed to be\nin aid of and supplementary to and in no case a limitation upon the\npowers heretofore vested in the port authority by the two said states\nand/or by congress, except as herein otherwise provided.Any declarations contained in this act with respect to the\ngovernmental nature of bridges and tunnels and to the exemption of\nbridge and tunnel property from taxation and to the discretion of the\nport authority with respect to bridge and tunnel operations shall not be\nconstrued to imply that other port authority property and operations are\nnot of a governmental nature, or that they are subject to taxation, or\nthat the determinations of the port authority with respect thereto are\nnot conclusive.The powers vested in the port authority herein (including but not\nlimited to the powers to acquire real property by condemnation and to\nmake or effectuate additions, improvements, approaches and connections)\nshall be continuing powers and no exercise thereof shall be deemed to\nexhaust them or any of them.§ 22. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect, diminish\nor impair the rights and obligations created by, or to repeal any of the\nprovisions of chapter three hundred and fifty-two of the laws of New\nJersey of nineteen hundred twenty and chapter two hundred and sixty-two\nof the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-four.If, however, any loss shall be suffered by or accrue to the said\nsinking fund, and if, after the making of the payment by the port\nauthority to the state of New Jersey as hereinbefore provided, the\nmoneys in the said sinking fund shall at any time be or become less than\nan amount equal to the principal amount of the then currently\noutstanding New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel bonds, or if the\nincome and interest currently received from or currently accruing upon\nthe moneys in the said sinking fund shall be or become insufficient to\npay the interest currently accruing upon or currently payable in\nconnection with the aforesaid New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel\nbonds, the state of New Jersey represents and agrees that it will make\ngood such deficits out of sources other than revenues from the said\nHolland tunnel.The said payment by the port authority to the state of New Jersey\nconstitutes repayment for all moneys contributed by the said state\ntoward the cost of construction of the said Holland tunnel, including\nthe moneys diverted and appropriated by chapter three hundred and\nnineteen of the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-six and\nchapter fifty-eight of the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred\ntwenty-seven from the road fund, created by chapter fifteen of the laws\nof New Jersey of nineteen hundred seventeen. The requirement of chapter\nfifty-eight of the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-seven\nthat the said moneys diverted and appropriated by the said statutes of\nthe state of New Jersey shall be returned and credited to the said road\nfund, with interest, shall be and shall be deemed to be satisfied and\ndischarged so far as it relates to the revenues arising from the\noperation of the said Holland tunnel.The provisions of this section shall constitute a covenant and\nagreement by the state of New York with the state of New Jersey, the\nport authority and the holders of any bonds or other obligations of the\nport authority, as security for which the tolls and revenues of said\nHolland tunnel may be pledged.§ 23. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to impair in any way\nthe obligation of the port authority to repay to the two states any or\nall advances made by them to the port authority in aid of bridge\nconstruction.§ 24. This act shall take effect upon the enactment into law by the\nstate of New Jersey of legislation having an identical effect with this\nact, but if the state of New Jersey shall have already enacted such\nlegislation this act shall take effect immediately.",
