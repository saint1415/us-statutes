      "text": "54.44 Hearing. (1) Time of hearing; provision of reports. (a) Time of hearing for petition. A petition for guardianship, other than a petition under par. (b) or (c) or s. 54.50 (1), shall be heard within 90 days after it is filed. The guardian ad litem and attorney for the proposed ward or ward shall be provided with a copy of the report of the examining physician or psychologist under s. 54.36 (1) at least 96 hours before the time of the hearing. (b) Time of hearing for certain appointments. A petition for guardianship of an individual who has been admitted to a nursing home or a community-based residential facility under s. 50.06 shall be heard within 60 days after it is filed. If an individual under s. 50.06 (3) alleges that an individual is making a health care decision under s. 50.06 (5) (a) that is not in the best interests of the incapacitated individual or if the incapacitated individual verbally objects to or otherwise actively protests the admission, the petition shall be heard as soon as possible within the 60-day period. (c) Time of hearing for petition for receipt and acceptance of a foreign guardianship. 1. If a motion for a hearing on a petition for receipt and acceptance of a foreign guardianship is made by the foreign ward, by a person who has received notice under s. 53.32 (2), or on the court’s own motion, a hearing on the petition shall be heard within 90 days after the petition is filed. 2. If a petition for receipt and acceptance of a foreign guardianship includes a request to modify the provisions of the foreign guardianship, the petition shall be heard within 90 days after it is filed. 3. If a person receiving notice of the petition for receipt and acceptance of the foreign guardianship challenges the validity of the foreign guardianship or the authority of the foreign court to appoint the foreign guardian, the court may stay the proceeding under this subsection to afford the opportunity to the interested person to have the foreign court hear the challenge and determine its merits. (2) Standard of proof. Any determination by the court as to whether the proposed ward or ward is a minor, is incompetent, or is a spendthrift shall be by clear and convincing evidence. (3) Presence of proposed guardian or petitioner. (a) The proposed guardian and any proposed standby guardian shall be physically present at the hearing unless the court excuses the attendance of either or, for good cause shown, permits attendance by telephone. (b) The petitioner, for a petition for receipt and acceptance of a foreign guardianship, shall be physically present at the hearing specified under sub. (1) (c) unless the court excuses the petitioner’s attendance or, for good cause shown, permits attendance by telephone. (4) Presence of proposed ward or ward. (a) Adult proposed ward or ward. The petitioner shall ensure that the proposed ward or ward attends the hearing unless the attendance is waived by the guardian ad litem. In determining whether to waive attendance by the proposed ward or ward, the guardian ad litem shall consider the ability of the proposed ward or ward to understand and meaningfully participate, the effect of the attendance of the proposed ward or ward on his or her physical or psychological health in relation to the importance of the proceeding, and the expressed desires of the proposed ward or ward. If the proposed ward or ward is unable to attend the hearing because of residency in a nursing home or other facility, physical inaccessibility, or a lack of transportation and if the proposed ward or ward, guardian ad litem, advocate counsel, or other interested person so requests, the court shall hold the hearing in a place where the proposed ward or ward may attend. (b) Minor proposed ward or ward. A minor proposed ward or ward is not required to attend the hearing. (c) Foreign ward. The petitioner for a petition for receipt and acceptance of a foreign guardianship shall ensure that the foreign ward attends the hearing unless the attendance is waived by the guardian ad litem. In determining whether to waive attendance by the foreign ward, the guardian ad litem shall consider the ability of the foreign ward to understand and meaningfully participate, the effect of the foreign ward’s attendance on his or her physical or psychological health in relation to the importance of the proceeding, and the foreign ward’s expressed desires. If the foreign ward is unable to attend the hearing because of residency in a nursing home or other facility, physical inaccessibility, or a lack of transportation and if the foreign ward, guardian ad litem, advocate counsel, or other interested person so requests, the court shall hold the hearing in a place where the foreign ward may attend. (5) Privacy of hearing. Every hearing under this chapter shall be closed, unless the proposed ward or ward or his or her attorney acting with the proposed ward’s or ward’s consent or the attorney for a foreign ward moves that it be open. If the hearing is closed, only interested persons, their attorneys, and witnesses may be present. (5m) Participation by interested persons. An interested person may participate in the hearing on the petition at the court’s discretion. (6) Proposed guardian unsuitable. If the court finds that the proposed guardian is unsuitable, the court shall request that a petition proposing a suitable guardian be filed, shall set a date for a hearing to be held within 30 days, and shall require the guardian ad litem to investigate the suitability of a new proposed guardian. History: 2005 a. 387 ss. 100, 333; 2007 a. 45; 2007 a. 97 ss. 78, 233; 2017 a. 187. The statutory provisions for an interested person’s formal participation in guardianship and protective placement hearings are specific and limited. No statute provides for interested persons to demand a trial, present evidence, or raise evidentiary objections. A court could consider such participation helpful and in its discretion allow an interested person to participate to the extent it considers appropriate. Coston v. Joseph P., 222 Wis. 2d 1, 586 N.W.2d 52 (Ct. App. 1998), 97-1210. Section 907.03 does not allow the proponent of an expert to use the expert solely as a conduit for the hearsay opinions of others. While in a civil proceeding there is no independent right to confront and cross-examine expert witnesses under the state and federal constitutions, procedures used to appoint a guardian and protectively place an individual must conform to the essentials of due process. Walworth County v. Therese B., 2003 WI App 223, 267 Wis. 2d 310, 671 N.W.2d 377, 03-0967. NOTE: The above annotations relate to guardianships under former ch. 880, 2003 stats., prior to the revision of and renumbering of that chapter to this chapter by 2005 Wis. Act 387. It would be unreasonable to not permit a forfeiture of the right to attend the hearing regardless of the respondent’s conduct. The right may be forfeited if after having been warned by the judge that the respondent will be removed if the respondent continues the disruptive behavior, the respondent nevertheless insists on conducting himself or herself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that the hearing cannot be carried on with the respondent in the courtroom. Jefferson County v. Joseph S., 2010 WI App 160, 330 Wis. 2d 737, 795 N.W.2d 450, 09-0804. A party cannot waive a challenge to the competency of a court based on a statutory limitation period such as that in sub. (1) (a). Tina B. v. Richard H., 2014 WI App 123, 359 Wis. 2d 204, 857 N.W.2d 432, 13-2534. The guardianship and protective placement statutes give certain rights under ss. 54.42 (5) and 55.10 (4) to an individual who is the subject of a guardianship or protective placement petition, including the “right to be present” at the final hearing on the petition. Sub. (4) (a) and s. 55.10 (2) also require a petitioner to ensure that the individual who is the subject of a petition “attends” the final hearing, unless the individual’s guardian ad litem waives the attendance. Waiver, in this context, requires some affirmative relinquishment on the part of the holder. Those statutes protect an individual’s right to be physically present in the room where the hearing is held. Racine County v. P.B., 2022 WI App 62, 405 Wis. 2d 383, 983 N.W.2d 721, 22-0765.",

(b) The name and relationship to the ward of any co-owner. (c) The marital property classification of the property and, for any property that is marital property, the spouse who has management and control rights with respect to the property.

(8) Citation to file inventory and to account. If any guardian neglects to file the inventory or account when required by law, the court shall call the attention of the guardian of the estate to the neglect. If the guardian of the estate continues to neglect his or her duty, the court shall order the guardian of the estate to file the inventory, and the costs may be adjudged against the guardian of the estate.

      "text": "54.62 Accounts. (1) Annual accounts. Except as provided in sub. (3) or unless waived by a court, every guardian, including a corporate guardian, shall, prior to April 15 of each year, file an account under oath that specifies the amount of the ward’s assets or income received and held or invested by the guardian, the nature and manner of the investment, and the guardian’s receipts and expenditures during the preceding calendar year. The court may order the guardian to render and file, within 30 days, a like account for less than a year. In lieu of the filing of these accounts before April 15 of each year, the court may, by appropriate order upon motion of the guardian, direct the guardian of an estate to render and file the annual accountings within 60 days after the anniversary date of the guardian’s qualification as guardian, with the accounting period from the anniversary date of qualification to the ensuing annual anniversary date. The guardian shall also report any change in the status of the surety upon the guardian’s bond. If the court determines it to be in the ward’s best interests, the court may specify the persons to whom the guardian shall distribute copies of the account. (2) Display of assets. Upon rendering the account the guardian shall produce for examination by the court, or by a person satisfactory to the court, evidence of all of the ward’s securities, depository accounts, and other investments, which shall be described in the account in sufficient detail so that they may be readily identified. The court or person satisfactory to the court shall ascertain whether the evidence of securities, depository accounts, and other investments correspond with the account. (3) Small estates. (a) If a ward’s income and assets do not exceed the amount specified in s. 867.03 (1g) (intro.), the guardian need not file an account under sub. (1) unless otherwise ordered to do so by the court. For the purposes of this paragraph, the value of the ward’s income and assets does not include the ward’s income, any burial trust possessed by the ward, or any term or other life insurance policy that is irrevocably assigned to pay for the disposition of the ward’s remains at death. (b) If the ward’s income and assets, as calculated under par. (a), increase above the amount specified in s. 867.03 (1g) (intro.), the guardian shall so notify the court, which shall determine if an annual account under sub. (1) or a final account under s. 54.66 is required. (4) Annual accounts of married wards. (a) For a married ward, the court may waive filing of an annual account under sub. (1) or permit the filing of a modified annual account, which shall be signed by the ward’s guardian and spouse and shall consist of all of the following: 1. Total assets of the ward, as determined under ch. 766, on January 1 of the year in question. 2. Income in the name of the ward, without regard to ch. 766, and the ward’s joint income. 3. Expenses incurred on behalf of the ward, including the ward’s proportionate share of household expenses if the ward and the ward’s spouse reside in the same household, without regard to ch. 766. 4. Total marital property of the ward, as determined under ch. 766, on December 31 of the year in question. (b) The court shall provide notice of the waiver under par. (a) to any adult child of the ward. (5) Examination of accounts. The account shall be examined as the court directs. If the account is not satisfactory, the court shall order action as justice requires and shall direct that notice be provided to the guardian personally or by certified mail. If notice is provided to the guardian under this subsection, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the ward. (6) Accounting by 3rd parties to guardian. If a guardian appointed by a court so requests, the court may order any person entrusted by the guardian with part of the estate of a ward to appear before the court and to render a full account, on oath, of the income or assets and of his or her action regarding the income or assets. If the person refuses to appear and render an account, the court may proceed against him or her as for contempt. (7) Notice of final action on an account. No action by the court on an account is final unless the guardian first provides notice to all of the following, as applicable: (a) The ward. (b) Any guardian ad litem appointed by the court. (c) Any personal representative or special administrator appointed by the court. (8) Accounts; failure of a guardian to file. If a guardian fails to file the guardian’s account as required by law or ordered by the court, the court may, upon its own motion or upon the petition of any interested party, order the guardian to show cause why the guardian should not immediately make and file the guardian’s reports or accounts. The court shall direct that a copy of the order be served on the guardian at least 20 days before the date that the court has ordered the guardian to appear in court. If a guardian fails, neglects or refuses to make and file any report or account after having been cited by the court to do so, or if the guardian fails to appear in court as directed by a citation issued by the court, the court may, on its own motion or on the petition of any interested party, issue a warrant directed to the sheriff ordering that the guardian be brought before the court to show cause why the guardian should not be punished for contempt. If the court finds that the failure, refusal, or neglect is willful or inexcusable, the guardian may be fined not to exceed $250 or imprisoned not to exceed 10 days or both. (9) Accounting by guardians at any time. The court may at any time require an accounting by any guardian at a hearing, after providing notice to all interested persons, including sureties on the bond of a guardian.
