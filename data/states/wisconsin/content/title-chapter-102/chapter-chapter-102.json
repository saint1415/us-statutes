History: 1975 c. 147 ss. 7 to 13, 54; 1975 c. 200; 1979 c. 89, 278; 1981 c. 92; 1983 a. 98, 189; 1985 a. 83; 1987 a. 179; 1989 a. 64; 1995 a. 27 ss. 3737 to 3741, 9130 (4); 1995 a. 117, 417; 1997 a. 3; 1999 a. 9, 14; 2001 a. 37; 2003 a. 139; 2007 a. 20; 2015 a. 55, 180; 2025 a. 33. In an occupational disease claim, the examiner may find the date of injury to be other than the last day of work. Royal-Globe Insurance Co. v. DILHR, 82 Wis. 2d 90, 260 N.W.2d 670 (1978). An intentionally inflicted injury, unexpected and unforeseen by the injured party, is an accident under sub. (2) (c). Jenson v. Employers Mutual Casualty Co., 161 Wis. 2d 253, 468 N.W.2d 1 (1991). But see Peterson v. Arlington Hospitality Staffing, Inc., 2004 WI App 199, 276 Wis. 2d 746, 689 N.W.2d 61, 03-2811. Cessation of employment under sub. (2) (g) 2. does not require that the employee no longer be employed, but requires that the employee no longer be employed in the employment that contributed to the disability. If that is the case, the employer that caused the injury is responsible. North River Insurance Co. v. Manpower Temporary Services, 212 Wis. 2d 63, 568 N.W.2d 15 (Ct. App. 1997), 96-2000. Sub. (2) (g) sets the date of injury of an occupational disease, and s. 102.42 (1) provides that medical expenses incurred before an employee knows of the work-related injury are compensable. Read together, medical expenses in occupational disease cases are not compensable until the date of injury, but once the date is established all expenses associated with the disease, even if incurred before the date of injury, are compensable. United Wisconsin Insurance Co. v. LIRC, 229 Wis. 2d 416, 600 N.W.2d 186 (Ct. App. 1999), 97-3776. Sub. (2) (g) 2. does not represent a comprehensive statement of a claimant’s burden of proof nor does it abrogate the requirement of s. 102.03 (1) (e) that the claimant must prove that the injury arose out of employment. It merely sets out a mechanism for fixing the time, occurrence, or date of an injury for purposes of identifying the proper employer against whom a claim may be made. White v. LIRC, 2000 WI App 244, 239 Wis. 2d 505, 620 N.W.2d 442, 00-0855. In the case of disease, the date of disability under sub. (2) (g) 2. was the date when the employee could no longer work, not when the employee first underwent an employer-required medical examination. Virginia Surety Co. v. LIRC, 2002 WI App 277, 258 Wis. 2d 665, 654 N.W.2d 306, 02-0031. A company in the business of loaning employees was not a “temporary help agency” under sub. (2) (f) when that company placed an employee with another employer who paid the loaning company, but without the loaning company’s knowledge assigned the employee to a third company. The statute requires that the employee is placed by the temporary help agency to the employer who will supervise that work. M.M. Schranz Roofing, Inc. v. First Choice Temporary, 2012 WI App 9, 338 Wis. 2d 420, 809 N.W.2d 880, 11-0345.",

      "text": "102.35 Penalties. (1) Every employer and every insurance company that fails to keep the records or to make the reports required by this chapter or that knowingly falsifies such records or makes false reports shall pay a work injury supplemental benefit surcharge to the state of not less than $10 nor more than $100 for each offense. The department may waive or reduce a surcharge imposed under this subsection if the employer or insurance company that violated this subsection requests a waiver or reduction of the surcharge within 45 days after the date on which notice of the surcharge is mailed to the employer or insurance company and shows that the violation was due to mistake or an absence of information. A surcharge imposed under this subsection is due within 30 days after the date on which notice of the surcharge is mailed to the employer or insurance company. Interest shall accrue on amounts that are not paid when due at the rate of 1 percent per month. All surcharges and interest payments received under this subsection shall be deposited in the fund established under s. 102.65. (2) Any employer, or duly authorized agent thereof, who, without reasonable cause, refuses to rehire an employee injured in the course of employment, or who, because of a claim or attempt to claim compensation benefits from such employer, discriminates or threatens to discriminate against an employee as to the employee’s employment, shall forfeit to the state not less than $50 nor more than $500 for each offense. No action under this subsection may be commenced except upon request of the department. (3) Any employer who without reasonable cause refuses to rehire an employee who is injured in the course of employment, when suitable employment is available within the employee’s physical and mental limitations, upon order of the department, has exclusive liability to pay to the employee, in addition to other benefits, the wages lost during the period of such refusal, not exceeding one year’s wages. In determining the availability of suitable employment the continuance in business of the employer shall be considered and any written rules promulgated by the employer with respect to seniority or the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement with respect to seniority shall govern. NOTE: Sub. (3) is shown as amended eff. 1-1-26 by 2025 Wis. Act 33. Prior to 1-1-26 it reads: (3) Any employer who without reasonable cause refuses to rehire an employee who is injured in the course of employment, when suitable employment is available within the employee’s physical and mental limitations, upon order of the department or the division, has exclusive liability to pay to the employee, in addition to other benefits, the wages lost during the period of such refusal, not exceeding one year’s wages. In determining the availability of suitable employment the continuance in business of the employer shall be considered and any written rules promulgated by the employer with respect to seniority or the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement with respect to seniority shall govern. History: 1975 c. 147; 1977 c. 29, 195; 2003 a. 144; 2005 a. 172; 2011 a. 183; 2015 a. 55; 2025 a. 33. An employer cannot satisfy sub. (3) by rehiring with an intent to fire at a later date. Dielectric Corp. v. LIRC, 111 Wis. 2d 270, 330 N.W.2d 606 (Ct. App. 1983). An employer’s termination of an employee, during the healing period, because of the work-related injury constitutes a refusal to rehire without reasonable cause in violation of sub. (3). To require a terminated employee to report to work in order to recover under sub. (3) as a prerequisite to recovery under sub. (3) is an unreasonable construction of the statute and would impose an unreasonable burden on any employee. L&H Wrecking Co. v. LIRC, 114 Wis. 2d 504, 339 N.W.2d 344 (Ct. App. 1983). But see Anderson v. LIRC, 2021 WI App 44, 398 Wis. 2d 668, 963 N.W.2d 89, 20-0027. An employer has the burden to prove that rehiring was in good faith. West Allis School District v. DILHR, 116 Wis. 2d 410, 342 N.W.2d 415 (1984). A one-day absence from work due to an injury triggered the rehire provision under sub. (3). Link Industries, Inc. v. LIRC, 141 Wis. 2d 551, 415 N.W.2d 574 (Ct. App. 1987). For liability under sub. (3), the employee must show that the employee: 1) was an employee; 2) sustained a compensable injury; 3) applied for rehire; and 4) had the application for rehire refused due to the injury. Universal Foods Corp. v. LIRC, 161 Wis. 2d 1, 467 N.W.2d 793 (Ct. App. 1991). Sub. (3) does not bar an employee from seeking arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement to determine whether termination following an injury violated the agreement. Sub. (3) relates to harm other than worker injuries and is not subject to the exclusive remedy provision of s. 102.03 (2); the “exclusive liability” language in sub. (3) does not bar lawsuits but imposes a penalty on the employer for refusal to hire. County of La Crosse v. WERC, 182 Wis. 2d 15, 513 N.W.2d 579 (1994). A Labor and Industry Review Commission interpretation of sub. (3), that a violation requires an employee who is unable to return to a prior employment to express an interest in reemployment in a different capacity, was reasonable. Hill v. LIRC, 184 Wis. 2d 101, 516 N.W.2d 441 (Ct. App. 1994). See also Anderson v. LIRC, 2021 WI App 44, 398 Wis. 2d 668, 963 N.W.2d 89, 20-0027. If an employer shows that it refused to rehire an injured employee because the employee’s position was eliminated to reduce costs and increase efficiency, reasonable cause has been shown under sub. (3). Ray Hutson Chevrolet, Inc. v. LIRC, 186 Wis. 2d 118, 519 N.W.2d 713 (Ct. App. 1994). An attendance policy that includes absences due to work-related injuries as part of the total of absences allowed before termination violates sub. (3). Great Northern Corp. v. LIRC, 189 Wis. 2d 313, 525 N.W.2d 361 (Ct. App. 1994). Sub. (3) does not contemplate requiring employers to either deviate from a facially reasonable and uniformly applied policy, or explain why it would be burdensome to do so, when a returning employee requests the deviation to accommodate a non-work and non-injury-related personal need. Sub. (3) does not contain “accommodation” requirements and does not require an employer to change its legitimate and long-standing safety policies in order to assist an employee in meeting personal obligations. DeBoer Transportation, Inc. v. Swenson, 2011 WI 64, 335 Wis. 2d 599, 804 N.W.2d 658, 09-0564. When an employee’s sub. (3) claim is predicated upon an employer’s allegedly unreasonable refusal to rehire the employee to fill a different position than the one the employee previously occupied, the employee must demonstrate that he or she made the employer aware, in some fashion, of the employee’s willingness to accept other work. Anderson v. LIRC, 2021 WI App 44, 398 Wis. 2d 668, 963 N.W.2d 89, 20-0027. Neither sub. (2) nor case law authorizes employees who are terminated for filing worker’s compensation claims to bring wrongful discharge claims against their employers. Brown v. Pick ’n Save Food Stores, 138 F. Supp. 2d 1133 (2001).",

      "heading": "Dependents",
      "text": "102.51 Dependents. (1) Who are. (a) The following persons are entitled to death benefits as if they are solely and wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee: 1. A married person upon his or her spouse with whom he or she is living at the time of the spouse’s death. 2m. A domestic partner under ch. 770 upon his or her partner with whom he or she is living at the time of the partner’s death. 3. A child under the age of 18 years upon the parent with whom he or she is living at the time of the death of the parent, there being no surviving dependent parent. 4. A child over the age of 18 years, but physically or mentally incapacitated from earning, upon the parent with whom he or she is living at the time of the death of the parent, there being no surviving dependent parent. (b) Where a dependent who is entitled to death benefits under this subsection survives the deceased employee, all other dependents shall be excluded. The charging of any portion of the support and maintenance of a child upon one of the parents, or any voluntary contribution toward the support of a child by a parent, or an obligation to support a child by a parent constitutes living with any such parent within the meaning of this subsection. (2) Who are not. (a) No person shall be considered a dependent unless that person is a spouse, a domestic partner under ch. 770, a divorced spouse who has not remarried, or a lineal descendant, lineal ancestor, brother, sister, or other member of the family, whether by blood or by adoption, of the deceased employee. (b) If for 8 years or more prior to the date of injury a deceased employee has been a resident of the United States, it shall be conclusively presumed that no person who has remained a nonresident alien during that period is either totally or partially dependent upon the deceased employee for support. (c) No person who is a nonresident alien shall be found to be either totally or partially dependent on a deceased employee for support who cannot establish dependency by proving contributions from the deceased employee by written evidence or tokens of the transfer of money, such as drafts, letters of credit, microfilm or other copies of paid share drafts, canceled checks, or receipts for the payment to any bank, express company, United States post office, or other agency commercially engaged in the transfer of funds from one country to another, for transmission of funds on behalf of said deceased employee to such nonresident alien claiming dependency. This provision shall not be applicable unless the employee has been continuously in the United States for at least one year prior to his or her injury, and has been remuneratively employed therein for at least 6 months. (3) Division among dependents. If there is more than one person wholly or partially dependent on a deceased employee, the death benefit shall be divided between those dependents in such proportion as the department determines to be just, considering their ages and other facts bearing on their dependency. NOTE: Sub. (3) is shown as amended eff. 1-1-26 by 2025 Wis. Act 33. Prior to 1-1-26 it reads: (3) Division among dependents. If there is more than one person wholly or partially dependent on a deceased employee, the death benefit shall be divided between those dependents in such proportion as the department or the division determines to be just, considering their ages and other facts bearing on their dependency. (4) Dependency as of the date of death. Questions as to who is a dependent and the extent of his or her dependency shall be determined as of the date of the death of the employee, and the dependent’s right to any death benefit becomes fixed at that time, regardless of any subsequent change in conditions. The death benefit shall be directly recoverable by and payable to the dependents entitled to the death benefit or their legal guardians or trustees. In case of the death of a dependent whose right to a death benefit has become fixed, so much of the benefit as is unpaid is payable to the dependent’s personal representatives in gross, unless the department determines that the unpaid benefit shall be reassigned under sub. (6) and paid to any other dependent who is physically or mentally incapacitated or a minor. For purposes of this subsection, a child of the employee who is born after the death of the employee is considered to be a dependent as of the date of death. NOTE: Sub. (4) is shown as amended eff. 1-1-26 by 2025 Wis. Act 33. Prior to 1-1-26 it reads: (4) Dependency as of the date of death. Questions as to who is a dependent and the extent of his or her dependency shall be determined as of the date of the death of the employee, and the dependent’s right to any death benefit becomes fixed at that time, regardless of any subsequent change in conditions. The death benefit shall be directly recoverable by and payable to the dependents entitled to the death benefit or their legal guardians or trustees. In case of the death of a dependent whose right to a death benefit has become fixed, so much of the benefit as is unpaid is payable to the dependent’s personal representatives in gross, unless the department or the division determines that the unpaid benefit shall be reassigned under sub. (6) and paid to any other dependent who is physically or mentally incapacitated or a minor. For purposes of this subsection, a child of the employee who is born after the death of the employee is considered to be a dependent as of the date of death. (5) When not interested. No dependent of an injured employee shall be deemed a party in interest to any proceeding by the employee for the enforcement of the employee’s claim for compensation, nor with respect to the compromise thereof by such employee. A compromise of all liability entered into by an employee is binding upon the employee’s dependents, except that any dependent of a deceased employee may submit the compromise for review under s. 102.16 (1). (6) Division among dependents. Benefits accruing to a minor dependent child may be awarded to either parent in the discretion of the department. Notwithstanding sub. (1), the department may reassign the death benefit as between a surviving spouse or a domestic partner under ch. 770 and any children specified in sub. (1) and s. 102.49 in accordance with their respective needs for the death benefit. NOTE: Sub. (6) is shown as amended eff. 1-1-26 by 2025 Wis. Act 33. Prior to 1-1-26 it reads: (6) Division among dependents. Benefits accruing to a minor dependent child may be awarded to either parent in the discretion of the department or the division. Notwithstanding sub. (1), the department or the division may reassign the death benefit as between a surviving spouse or a domestic partner under ch. 770 and any children specified in sub. (1) and s. 102.49 in accordance with their respective needs for the death benefit. (7) Certain defense barred. In proceedings for the collection of primary death benefit or burial expense it shall not be a defense that the applicant, either individually or as a partner or member, was an employer of the deceased. History: 1975 c. 94, 147; 1977 c. 195; 1981 c. 92; 1983 a. 98, 368; 1993 a. 112, 492; 1995 a. 225; 1997 a. 253; 1999 a. 162; 2009 a. 28; 2015 a. 55; 2023 a. 213; 2025 a. 33. A posthumously born illegitimate child does not qualify as a dependent under sub. (4). Claimants not falling within one of the classifications under sub. (2) (a) will not qualify for benefits, regardless of dependency in fact. Larson v. DILHR, 76 Wis. 2d 595, 252 N.W.2d 33 (1977). Sub. (5) has no application to a claim for a death benefit because a death benefit claim is not an “employee’s claim for compensation.” While sub. (5) prohibits a dependent from being a party to a worker’s claim for disability benefits, a dependent claiming a death benefit is prosecuting only the dependent’s own claim. Edward Brothers, Inc. v. LIRC, 2007 WI App 128, 300 Wis. 2d 638, 731 N.W.2d 302, 06-2398.",
