History: 1971 c. 185 ss. 1, 5; 1971 c. 228 ss. 15, 44; 1975 c. 413, 421; 1977 c. 29; 1983 a. 189 ss. 142, 143, 329 (4); 1985 a. 135 s. 83 (3); 1987 a. 161; 1993 a. 27, 184, 327; 1995 a. 27 ss. 3611 to 3629, 9116 (5); 1997 a. 237; 1999 a. 9; 2001 a. 16; 2007 a. 20; 2011 a. 32, 146; 2017 a. 59, 198; 2017 a. 331 s. 43. In a safe place action by a plaintiff injured through contact with home power lines while installing aluminum trim on the premises, the power lines did not constitute a place of employment under sub. (2) (a) [now sub. (11)]. Although a “process or operation” was carried on by the transmission of electricity through the lines, no person was employed by the power company on the premises at the time of the injury. Barthel v. Wisconsin Electric Power Co., 69 Wis. 2d 446, 230 N.W.2d 863 (1975). A vocational school was not a place of employment. Korenak v. Curative Workshop Adult Rehabilitation Center, 71 Wis. 2d 77, 237 N.W.2d 43 (1976). The right to make progress inspections and to stop construction for noncompliance with specifications is not an exercise of control sufficient to make an architect an owner under sub. (2) (i) [now sub. (10)]. Luterbach v. Mochon, Schutte, Hackworthy, Juerisson, Inc., 84 Wis. 2d 1, 267 N.W.2d 13 (1978). Distinguishing “safe employment” and “safe place of employment.” There is a duty to provide safe employment to employees that does not extend to frequenters, while the duty to provide a safe place of employment does extend to frequenters. Leitner v. Milwaukee County, 94 Wis. 2d 186, 287 N.W.2d 803 (1980). An Elks Club was a “place of employment.” Schmorrow v. Sentry Insurance Co., 138 Wis. 2d 31, 405 N.W.2d 672 (Ct. App. 1987). A person seeking directions to the location of an intended, but unknown, destination is a frequenter under sub. (2) (d) [now sub. (6)]. When such inquiry is not made, or has concluded, and the person deviates into an area the person is not explicitly or impliedly invited into, frequenter status is lost. Monsivais v. Winzenried, 179 Wis. 2d 758, 508 N.W.2d 620 (Ct. App. 1993). The duty of an owner of a multiple-unit residential dwelling under the safe place statute extends only to common areas. Antwaun A. v. Heritage Mutual Insurance Co., 228 Wis. 2d 44, 596 N.W.2d 456 (1999), 97-0332. “Tenants” under sub. (12) refers to the number of units available in the building, not to the number of individuals in the building. Raymaker v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co., 2006 WI App 117, 293 Wis. 2d 392, 718 N.W.2d 154, 05-1557.",
