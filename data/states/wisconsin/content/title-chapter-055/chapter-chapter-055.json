History: 1973 c. 284; 1975 c. 393, 430; 1979 c. 221; 1985 a. 29 s. 3200 (56); 1985 a. 176; 1991 a. 316; 1993 a. 445; 2003 a. 33; 2005 a. 264, 387, 388; 2007 a. 45, 96; 2011 a. 126. Cross-reference: See also s. 46.011 for definitions applicable to chs. 46, 48 to 51, 54, 55, and 58. The guardian ad litem is an interested person. A guardian ad litem appointed by the circuit court to represent the ward’s best interest becomes an official of a public agency concerned with the person’s welfare by virtue of that appointment and falls within the definition of “interested person” in the protective placement system of this chapter. Linda L. v. Collis, 2006 WI App 105, 294 Wis. 2d 637, 718 N.W.2d 205, 05-0494. Alzheimer’s disease is one type of a degenerative brain disorder. Ch. 51 includes the definition of degenerative brain disorder only to specifically exclude it from the chapter’s authority, whereas the definition under this chapter is used to include it in the scope of authority granted under this chapter. Rehabilitation is a necessary element of treatment under ch. 51. Because there are no techniques that can be employed to bring about rehabilitation from Alzheimer’s disease, an individual with the disease cannot be rehabilitated. Accordingly, an Alzheimer’s patient is not a proper subject for ch. 51 treatment. Fond du Lac County v. Helen E.F., 2011 WI App 72, 333 Wis. 2d 740, 798 N.W.2d 707, 10-2061.
