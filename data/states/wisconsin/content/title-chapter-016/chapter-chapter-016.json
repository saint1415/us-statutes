(1) The department shall establish by rule a schedule of annual fees to be paid by nuclear power plant operators and shall collect the fees until a regional facility operated under s. 16.11 begins accepting waste for disposal. The fees shall be based on the number of nuclear reactors at each plant and shall cover 75 percent of the state’s costs enumerated in sub. (3) incurred prior to the acceptance of waste at the facility. (2) The department shall establish by rule a schedule of annual fees to be paid by generators, as defined under s. 16.11 (2) (j), who use a compact facility, as defined in s. 16.11 (2) (d), or a noncompact facility made available by an agreement entered into under s. 16.11 (3) (h) 6. for disposal, and, beginning with the operation of the facility, the department shall collect the fees.

(1). In addition to covering the costs enumerated under sub. (3), the fees established under this subsection for the first 5 years after the acceptance of waste for disposal at the facility shall be sufficient to repay the loan from the general fund made under s. 20.505 (1) (b), and the secretary shall lapse moneys from the appropriation under s. 20.505 (1) (g) to the general fund for that purpose over the 5-year period.
