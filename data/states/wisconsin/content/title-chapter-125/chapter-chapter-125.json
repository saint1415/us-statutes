Subject to pars.

If the brewer’s cumulative volume in a year was at least 250 barrels of fermented malt beverages but less than 2,500 barrels of fermented malt beverages, the brewer may establish one full-service retail outlet. 2.

(3m), from a brewpub authorized to make sales to retailers under s. 125.295 (1) (g), or from a permittee under s. 125.30 authorized to make sales to retailers under s. 125.30 (4). 2. A brewer is not required to purchase from another permittee fermented malt beverages manufactured by the brewer that the brewer sells at retail on the brewery premises or at a full-service retail outlet of the brewer. 3. Subject to subd. 2. and par. (f), a brewer engaged in full-service retail sales on brewery premises or at a full-service retail outlet of the brewer is subject to ss. 125.33 (9) and 125.69 (6) to the same extent as if the brewer were a retail licensee. (d) 1. A brewer may not commence sales of alcohol beverages at a full-service retail outlet unless, prior to commencing such sales, the brewer receives approval from the municipality in which the full-service retail outlet is located and from the division as provided in par. (g). 2. Subject to par. (f), a municipality may limit the scope of alcohol beverages offered for sale at a full-service retail outlet only with respect to alcohol beverages that are not of the same type as those produced by the person holding the brewer’s permit. A municipality may not limit the sale, at a full-service retail outlet, of alcohol beverages produced by the person holding the brewer’s permit. A municipality may not limit the scope of alcohol beverages offered for sale under sub. (3) (h). If a municipality limits the scope of alcohol beverages offered for sale, the provision of taste samples is limited to those alcohol beverages authorized to be sold. 3. Except as provided in subd. 2., a municipality’s approval under subd. 1. shall be based on the same standards and criteria that the municipality has established by ordinance for the evaluation and approval of retail license applications. A municipality may not impose any requirement or restriction in connection with the approval under subd. 1. that the municipality does not impose on retail licensees. (e) If a brewer operates a restaurant as provided in sub. (6) and is authorized under this subsection to make retail sales of wine at the restaurant, the brewer may make retail sales of wine in an opened original bottle, in a quantity not to exceed one bottle, for consumption both at the restaurant and away from the restaurant if all of the following apply: 1. The purchaser of the wine orders food to be consumed at the restaurant. 2. The brewer provides a dated receipt that identifies the purchase of the food and the bottle of wine. 3. Prior to the opened, partially consumed bottle of wine being taken away from the restaurant, the brewer securely reinserts the cork into the bottle to the point where the top of the cork is even with the top of the bottle, or securely reattaches the original cap to the bottle, and the cork is reinserted or the cap is reattached at a time other than during the hours in which the brewer is prohibited under sub. (8) (b) from making retail sales for off-premises consumption. (f) 1. If a brewer may establish one or more full-service retail outlets under pars. (b) and (g) and the brewer also holds a manufacturer’s or rectifier’s permit or winery permit or both and, as such, may establish full-service retail outlets under s. 125.52 (4) (b) and (g) or 125.53 (3) (b) and (g), the aggregate number of full-service retail outlets that may be established is the maximum number authorized under par. (b), under s. 125.52 (4) (b), or under s. 125.53 (3) (b), whichever is greatest, but not exceeding 3 full-service retail outlets. Under these circumstances, each authorized full-service retail outlet shall serve as the full-service retail outlet associated with each applicable permit, regardless of whether the permittee would otherwise be entitled to fewer full-service retail outlets when calculated under par. (b) or s. 125.52 (4) (b) or 125.53 (3) (b). 2. If a brewer may engage in full-service retail sales on the brewery premises as provided in par. (a) 2. and the brewer also holds a manufacturer’s or rectifier’s permit or winery permit or both, the brewer may make retail sales on the brewery premises of intoxicating liquor produced under its manufacturer’s or rectifier’s permit or winery permit without first purchasing the intoxicating liquor from a wholesaler holding a permit under s. 125.54. 3. If a person holds more than one brewer’s permit under this section, the retail sales authority under this subsection for brewery premises applies with respect to each brewer’s permit, but the limit on full-service retail outlets is an aggregate maximum, regardless of the number of brewer’s permits held. (g) 1. An application for a brewer’s permit, including an application for an amendment to the brewer’s permit, shall specify each full-service retail outlet of the brewer and particularly describe the premises of the full-service retail outlet. 2. The division shall establish a process for approval of a brewer’s full-service retail outlet and for revocation of this approval. The division shall approve a brewer’s full-service retail outlet, and may not revoke this approval, unless the brewer has violated a provision of this chapter related to full-service retail outlets. The division’s failure to approve, or revocation of approval of, a full-service retail outlet described in a brewer’s application or permit does not affect any other full-service retail outlet or the brewery premises as described in the application or permit. 3. If the division approves a full-service retail outlet, the brewer’s permit, as initially issued or as amended, shall particularly describe the premises constituting the full-service retail outlet, which shall be considered part of the premises under the brewer’s permit. 4. If the division approves a full-service retail outlet, the agent appointed under s. 125.04 (6) for the brewer’s permit shall also serve as the agent for the full-service retail outlet. 5. Section 125.04 (12) (a) does not apply to a brewer’s full-service retail outlet. Upon notice to the division, a brewer may relocate any full-service retail outlet to a new location within this state once per calendar year, except that one full-service retail outlet of a brewer may be relocated without limitation on frequency in each calendar year. (h) A brewer that is eligible to establish a full-service retail outlet under this subsection is not authorized to make retail sales of fermented malt beverages at an off-site retail outlet under sub. (3) (e) and (f). (8) Closing hours. (a) On brewery premises, no person may sell alcohol beverages at retail for on-premises consumption, provide taste samples of alcohol beverages, or consume alcohol beverages during the closing hours applicable to a Class “B” licensee under s. 125.32 (3) (a). A full-service retail outlet under sub. (7) shall be subject to the same closing hours applicable to a Class “B” licensee under s. 125.32 (3) (a). (b) On brewery premises and at a full-service retail outlet, no person may sell alcohol beverages at retail for off-premises consumption during the hours in which a Class “B” licensee in the municipality where the brewery or retail outlet is located may not make retail sales under s. 125.32 (3) (am) and (d). (c) No member of the public or invited guests may be present on brewery premises during the closing hours applicable to a Class “B” licensee under s. 125.32 (3) (a).
