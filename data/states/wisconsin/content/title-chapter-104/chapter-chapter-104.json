History: 1977 c. 29; 1983 a. 189, 458; 1989 a. 225; 1993 a. 144, 399; 1995 a. 27 ss. 9130 (4), 9145 (1); 1997 a. 3, 27, 112; 2005 a. 12; 2013 a. 285; 2015 a. 55, 258; 2017 a. 364. Based on the text of sub. (3) (a) and the consistent focus on control shown across various areas of Wisconsin employment law, allegations giving rise to a plausible inference of control over a person employed at labor are enough to plead that a person or business is an employer under Wisconsin’s minimum wage law.
