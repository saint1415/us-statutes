(2) Relation to state valuation; description. The value of the property of each company for assessment shall be made on the same basis and for the same period of time, as near as may be, as the value of the general property of the state is ascertained and determined. The department shall prepare an assessment roll and place thereon after the name of each company assessed, the following general description of the property of such company, which the department shall deem and hold to include the entire property and franchises of the company specified and all title and interest therein: “Real estate, right-of-way, tracks, stations, terminals, appurtenances, franchises, and all other real estate and personal property of the company,” in the case of railroads, and “Real estate, right-of-way, poles, wires, conduits, cables, devices, appliances, instruments, franchises, and all other real and personal property of the company,” in the case of conservation and regulation companies, and “Real estate, appurtenances, rolling stock, equipment, franchises, and all other real estate and personal property of the company,” in the case of air carrier companies, and “Land and land rights, structures, improvements, mains, pumping and regulation equipment, services, appliances, instruments, franchises, and all other real and personal property of the company,” in the case of pipeline companies. (3) Assessment. For the purpose of determining the full market value of the property of each company appearing on the assessment roll, the department may view and inspect the property of such company and shall consider the reports filed in compliance with s. 76.04 and the reports and returns of the company filed in the office of any officer of this state, and other evidence or information bearing upon the full market value of the property of the company assessed. In case of companies which own or use property lying partly within and partly without the state, the department shall value and assess only the property within this state, using the methods under subs. (4g) and (4r). When the full market value of the property of a company within this state has been determined, the amount shall be entered upon the assessment roll opposite the name of the company and shall be the assessment of the entire property of such company within this state for the levy of taxes thereon, subject to review and correction. The department shall thereupon give notice by certified mail to each company assessed of the amount of its assessment as entered upon such roll. (4g) Determining the property in this state. The department shall determine the property in this state of railroad companies, air carrier companies, pipeline companies and telephone companies in the following manner: (a) Railroad companies.

(1) If any tax levied under the provisions of s. 76.13 shall be adjudged illegal and nonenforceable, or shall be set aside by any court of the state of competent jurisdiction, it shall be the duty of the department, whether any part of the taxes assessed and levied have been paid or not, to forthwith reascertain and redetermine the value of the property of the companies or the value of the general property of the state or the average rate of taxation throughout the state as may be required; and when such reascertainment and redetermination has been made, to make a duplicate of the original assessment roll and to extend the taxes thereon according to such reassessment, and when such duplicate roll has been made and the taxes extended thereon in the manner provided in this section, it shall be of the same force and effect as the original assessment made in accordance with law. The proceedings for such reassessment and for the extension, payment and collection of taxes upon such duplicate assessment roll shall be conducted in the method originally provided for as near as may be. The department shall fix the time and place for the hearings or proceedings for the reassessment and give notice thereof by mail to the companies. (2) The power to reassess the property of any company defined in s. 76.02 and the general property of the state, and to redetermine the average rate of taxation, may be exercised under sub. (1) as often as may be necessary until the amount of taxes legally due from any such company for any year under ss. 76.01 to 76.26 has been finally and definitely determined. Whenever any sum or part thereof, levied upon any property subject to taxation under ss. 76.01 to 76.26 so set aside has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment upon the property, and the reassessment of taxes to that extent shall be deemed to be satisfied. When the tax roll on the reassessment is completed and delivered to the secretary of administration, the department shall immediately notify by certified mail each of the several companies taxed to pay the amount of the taxes extended on the tax roll within 30 days.
