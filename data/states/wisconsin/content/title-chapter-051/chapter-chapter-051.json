History: 1975 c. 430 ss. 11, 81; 1977 c. 26; 1977 c. 203 s. 106; 1977 c. 428; 1981 c. 79 s. 17; 1983 a. 189 s. 329 (19); 1983 a. 441; 1985 a. 29 s. 3202 (23); 1985 a. 265, 307; 1993 a. 445; 1995 a. 27; 1997 a. 47; 1999 a. 9; 2005 a. 264, 344, 387, 388; 2007 a. 45; 2009 a. 28; 2011 a. 126; 2013 a. 246; 2017 a. 34; 2023 a. 229. Cross-reference: See s. 46.011 for definitions applicable to chs. 46, 48, 50, 51, 54, 55, and 58. “Treatment” does not include habilitation. Milwaukee County Combined Community Services Board v. Athans, 107 Wis. 2d 331, 320 N.W.2d 30 (Ct. App. 1982). Alzheimer’s disease is one type of a degenerative brain disorder. This chapter includes the definition of degenerative brain disorder only to specifically exclude it from the chapter’s authority, whereas the ch. 55 definition is used to include it in the scope of authority granted under ch. 55. Rehabilitation is a necessary element of treatment under this chapter. Because there are no techniques that can be employed to bring about rehabilitation from Alzheimer’s disease, an individual with the disease cannot be rehabilitated. Accordingly, an Alzheimer’s patient is not a proper subject for treatment under this chapter. Fond du Lac County v. Helen E.F., 2011 WI App 72, 333 Wis. 2d 740, 798 N.W.2d 707, 10-2061. Affirmed. 2012 WI 50, 340 Wis. 2d 500, 814 N.W.2d 179, 10-2061. “Rehabilitation,” as used in sub. (17), addresses the control of symptoms. It comprises treatment going beyond custodial care to affect the disease and symptoms. But rehabilitation is not synonymous with cure. A symptom is an expression of the disorder at work within the patient. Rehabilitation refers to improving the patient’s condition through ameliorating endogenous factors such as symptoms and behaviors. If a treatment controls symptoms to such a degree that withdrawing it would subject the patient to a more restrictive treatment alternative, then the treatment controls enough symptoms to establish the patient has rehabilitative potential. Waukesha County v. J.W.J., 2017 WI 57, 375 Wis. 2d 542, 895 N.W.2d 783, 16-0046.",

Every probationer, parolee or person on extended supervision who receives evaluation or treatment under this chapter shall be notified of the provisions of this subdivision by the individual’s probation, extended supervision and parole agent. Release of records under this subdivision is limited to: a. The report of an evaluation which is provided pursuant to the written probation, extended supervision and parole supervision plan. b.

If the guardian or parent objects in writing within 15 days after the notice is mailed, the staff member may not obtain the additional information. e. The restrictions on information that is obtainable by staff members of the protection and advocacy agency or private, nonprofit corporation that are specified in subd. 18. c. and d. do not apply if the custodian of the record fails to promptly provide the name and address of the parent or guardian; if a complaint is received by the agency or nonprofit corporation about a patient, or if the agency or nonprofit corporation determines that there is probable cause to believe that the health or safety of the patient is in serious and immediate jeopardy, the agency or nonprofit corporation has made a good-faith effort to contact the parent or guardian upon receiving the name and address of the parent or guardian, the agency or nonprofit corporation has either been unable to contact the parent or guardian or has offered assistance to the parent or guardian to resolve the situation and the parent or guardian has failed or refused to act on behalf of the patient; if a complaint is received by the agency or nonprofit corporation about a patient or there is otherwise probable cause to believe that the patient has been subject to abuse or neglect by a parent or guardian; or if the patient is a minor whose custody has been transferred to a legal custodian, as defined in s. 48.02 (11) or for whom a guardian that is an agency of the state or a county has been appointed. 19. To state and local law enforcement agencies for the purpose of reporting an apparent crime committed on the premises of an inpatient treatment facility or nursing home, if the facility or home has treatment records subject to this section, or observed by staff or agents of any such facility or nursing home. Information released under this subdivision is limited to identifying information that may be released under subd. 16. and information related to the apparent crime. 20. Except with respect to the treatment records of a subject individual who is receiving or has received services for alcoholism or drug dependence, to the spouse, domestic partner under ch. 770, parent, adult child or sibling of a subject individual, if the spouse, domestic partner, parent, adult child or sibling is directly involved in providing care to or monitoring the treatment of the subject individual and if the involvement is verified by the subject individual’s physician, psychologist or by a person other than the spouse, domestic partner, parent, adult child or sibling who is responsible for providing treatment to the subject individual, in order to assist in the provision of care or monitoring of treatment. Except in an emergency as determined by the person verifying the involvement of the spouse, domestic partner, parent, adult child or sibling, the request for treatment records under this subdivision shall be in writing, by the requester. Unless the subject individual has been adjudicated incompetent in this state, the person verifying the involvement of the spouse, domestic partner, parent, adult child or sibling shall notify the subject individual about the release of his or her treatment records under this subdivision. Treatment records released under this subdivision are limited to the following: a. A summary of the subject individual’s diagnosis and prognosis. b.

To the department of corrections or to a sheriff, to determine if a person incarcerated is complying with the assessment or the driver safety plan ordered under s. 343.30 (1q) (c). 27. For the purpose of entering information concerning the subject individual into the statewide automated child welfare information system established under s. 48.47 (7g). 28. To the department of justice, under the requirements of ss. 51.20 (13) (cv) 4. and 51.45 (13) (i) 4. (c) Limitation on release of alcohol and drug treatment records. Notwithstanding par. (b), whenever federal law or applicable federal regulations restrict, or as a condition to receipt of federal aids require that this state restrict the release of information contained in the treatment records of any patient who receives treatment for alcoholism or drug dependency in a program or facility to a greater extent than permitted under this section, the department may by rule restrict the release of such information as may be necessary to comply with federal law and regulations. Rules promulgated under this paragraph shall supersede this section with respect to alcoholism and drug dependency treatment records in those situations in which they apply. (cg) Limited release of information of foster children. If the subject of a treatment record is a child who is placed in out-of-home care, a health care provider may disclose to an out-of-home care provider, as defined in s. 48.02 (12r), and a child welfare agency without informed written consent a portion, but not a copy, of the child’s treatment record that the health care provider reasonably believes is necessary for the proper care of the child, such as the diagnosis, treatment plan, and medication management plan. (cm) Required access to certain information. Notwithstanding par. (a), treatment records of an individual shall, upon request, be released without informed written consent, except as restricted under par. (c), to the parent, child, sibling, spouse, or domestic partner under ch. 770 of an individual who is or was a patient at an inpatient facility; to a law enforcement officer who is seeking to determine whether an individual is on unauthorized absence from the facility; and to mental health professionals who are providing treatment to the individual at the time that the information is released to others. Information released under this paragraph is limited to notice as to whether or not an individual is a patient at the inpatient facility and, if the individual is no longer a patient at the inpatient facility, the facility or other place, if known, at which the individual is located. This paragraph does not apply under any of the following circumstances: 1. To the individual’s parent, child, sibling, spouse, or domestic partner under ch. 770 who is requesting information, if the individual has specifically requested that the information be withheld from the parent, child, sibling, spouse, or domestic partner. 2. If, in the opinion of the inpatient facility, there is reasonable cause to believe that disclosure of the information would result in danger to the individual. (d) Individual access. 1. Access to treatment records by a subject individual during his or her treatment may be restricted by the director of the treatment facility. However, access may not be denied at any time to records of all medications and somatic treatments received by the individual. 2. The subject individual shall have a right, following discharge under s. 51.35 (4), to a complete record of all medications and somatic treatments prescribed during admission or commitment and to a copy of the discharge summary which was prepared at the time of his or her discharge. A reasonable and uniform charge for reproduction may be assessed. 3. In addition to the information provided under subd. 2., the subject individual shall, following discharge, if the individual so requests, have access to and have the right to receive from the facility a photostatic copy of any or all of his or her treatment records. A reasonable and uniform charge for reproduction may be assessed. The director of the treatment facility or such person’s designee and the treating physician have a right to be present during inspection of any treatment records. Notice of inspection of treatment records shall be provided to the director of the treatment facility and the treating physician at least one full day, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, before inspection of the records is made. Treatment records may be modified prior to inspection to protect the confidentiality of other patients or the names of any other persons referred to in the record who gave information subject to the condition that his or her identity remain confidential. Entire documents may not be withheld in order to protect such confidentiality. 4. At the time of discharge all individuals shall be informed by the director of the treatment facility or such person’s designee of their rights as provided in this subsection. (dm) Destruction, damage, falsification or concealment of treatment records. No person may do any of the following: 1. Intentionally falsify a treatment record. 2. Conceal or withhold a treatment record with intent to prevent its release to the subject individual under par. (d), to his or her guardian, or to persons with the informed written consent of the subject individual or with intent to prevent or obstruct an investigation or prosecution. 3. Intentionally destroy or damage records in order to prevent or obstruct an investigation or prosecution. (e) Notation of release of information. Each time written information is released from a treatment record, a notation shall be made in the record by the custodian thereof that includes the following: the name of the person to whom the information was released; the identification of the information released; the purpose of the release; and the date of the release. The subject individual shall have access to such release data as provided in par. (d). (f) Correction of information. A subject individual, the parent, guardian, or person in the place of a parent of a minor, or the guardian of an individual adjudicated incompetent may, after having gained access to treatment records, challenge the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or relevance of factual information in his or her treatment records and request in writing that the facility maintaining the record correct the challenged information. The request shall be granted or denied within 30 days by the director of the treatment facility, the director of the county department under s. 51.42 or 51.437, or the secretary depending upon which person has custody of the record. Reasons for denial of the requested changes shall be given by the responsible officer and the individual shall be informed of any applicable grievance procedure or court review procedure. If the request is denied, the individual, parent, guardian, or person in the place of a parent shall be allowed to insert into the record a statement correcting or amending the information at issue. The statement shall become a part of the record and shall be released whenever the information at issue is released. (g) Applicability. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (dm) and (e) apply to all treatment records, including those on which written, drawn, printed, spoken, visual, electromagnetic or digital information is recorded or preserved, regardless of physical form or characteristics. (5) Minors and incompetents. (a) Consent for release of information. The parent, guardian, or person in the place of a parent of a minor or the guardian of an adult adjudicated incompetent in this state may consent to the release of confidential information in court or treatment records. A minor who is aged 14 or more may consent to the release of confidential information in court or treatment records without the consent of the minor’s parent, guardian or person in the place of a parent. Consent under this paragraph must conform to the requirements of sub. (2). (b) Access to information. 1. The guardian of an individual who is adjudicated incompetent in this state shall have access to the individual’s court and treatment records at all times. The parent, guardian or person in the place of a parent of a developmentally disabled minor shall have access to the minor’s court and treatment records at all times except in the case of a minor aged 14 or older who files a written objection to such access with the custodian of the records. The parent, guardian or person in the place of a parent of other minors shall have the same rights of access as provided to subject individuals under this section. 2. A minor who is aged 14 or older shall have access to his or her own court and treatment records, as provided in this section. A minor under the age of 14 shall have access to court records but only in the presence of a parent, guardian, counsel, guardian ad litem or judge and shall have access to treatment records as provided in this section but only in the presence of a parent, guardian, counsel, guardian ad litem or staff member of the treatment facility. (bm) Parents denied physical placement. A parent who has been denied periods of physical placement with a child under s. 767.41 (4) (b) or 767.451 (4) may not have the rights of a parent or guardian under pars. (a) and (b) with respect to access to that child’s court or treatment records. (c) Juvenile court records. The court records of juveniles admitted or committed under this chapter shall be kept separately from all other juvenile court records. (d) Other juvenile records. Sections 48.78 and 938.78 do not apply to records covered by this section. (e) Temporary guardian for adult alleged to be incompetent. If an adult is alleged to be incompetent, under the requirements of s. 54.10 (3), to consent to the release of records under this section, but no guardian has been appointed for the individual, consent for the release of records may be given by a temporary guardian who is appointed for the purpose of deciding upon the release of records. (f) Applicability. Paragraph (a) and (bm) to (e) apply to all treatment records, including those on which written, drawn, printed, spoken, visual, electromagnetic or digital information is recorded or preserved, regardless of physical form or characteristics. (6) Privileges. Sections 905.03 and 905.04 supersede this section with respect to communications between physicians and patients and between attorneys and clients. (7) Criminal commitments. Except as otherwise specifically provided, this section applies to the treatment records of persons who are committed under chs. 971 and 975. (8) Grievances. Failure to comply with any provisions of this section may be processed as a grievance under s. 51.61 (5), except that a grievance resolution procedure option made available to the patient, as required under s. 457.04 (8), applies to failures to comply by a licensed mental health professional who is not affiliated with a county department or treatment facility. However, use of the grievance procedure is not required before bringing any civil action or filing a criminal complaint under this section. (9) Actions for violations; damages; injunction. (a) Any person, including the state or any political subdivision of the state, violating this section shall be liable to any person damaged as a result of the violation for such damages as may be proved, together with exemplary damages of not more than $1,000 for each violation and such costs and reasonable actual attorney fees as may be incurred by the person damaged. (b) In any action brought under par. (a) in which the court determines that the violator acted in a manner that was knowing and willful, the violator shall be liable for such damages as may be proved together with exemplary damages of not more than $25,000 for each violation, together with costs and reasonable actual attorney fees as may be incurred. It is not a prerequisite to an action under this subsection that the plaintiff suffer or be threatened with actual damages. (c) An individual may bring an action to enjoin any violation of this section or to compel compliance with this section, and may in the same action seek damages as provided in this subsection. The individual may recover costs and reasonable actual attorney fees as may be incurred in the action, if he or she prevails. (10) Penalties. (a) Whoever does any of the following may be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned for not more than 9 months or both: 1. Requests or obtains confidential information under this section under false pretenses. 2. Discloses confidential information under this section with knowledge that the disclosure is unlawful and is not reasonably necessary to protect another from harm. 3. Violates sub.

History: 1975 c. 430; 1977 c. 26 s. 75; 1977 c. 61, 428; 1979 c. 110 s. 60 (1); 1983 a. 27, 292, 398, 538; 1985 a. 29, 176; 1985 a. 292 s. 3; 1985 a. 332 ss. 97, 98, 251 (1); 1987 a. 352, 355, 362, 367, 399, 403; 1989 a. 31, 334, 336; 1991 a. 39, 189; 1993 a. 196, 445, 479; 1995 a. 169, 440; 1997 a. 35, 231, 237, 283, 292; 1999 a. 32, 78, 79, 109; 2001 a. 16, 38; 2005 a. 25, 344, 387, 388, 406, 434; 2005 a. 443 s. 265; 2005 a. 444, 449, 485; 2007 a. 20 ss. 1817, 9121 (6) (a); 2007 a. 45, 97, 108; 2009 a. 28, 258; 2013 a. 20; 2017 a. 252; 2019 a. 109; 2021 a. 22. By entering a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the defendant lost the physician-patient privilege by virtue of s. 905.04 (4) (c) and the confidentiality of treatment records under sub. (4) (b) 4. State v. Taylor, 142 Wis. 2d 36, 417 N.W.2d 192 (Ct. App. 1987). Section 905.04 supersedes this section with respect to all relationships listed in s. 905.04 and is not strictly limited to the physician-patient relationship. State v. S.H., 159 Wis. 2d 730, 465 N.W.2d 238 (Ct. App. 1990). The release of court records “pursuant to lawful order of the court” under sub. (3) is allowable when access fits within or is comparable to one of the exceptions for treatment records under sub. (4) (b) or when a significant interrelationship exists between the records of the civil commitment proceeding at issue and a criminal proceeding involving a violent felony pending prior to the civil commitment. Billy Jo W. v. Metro, 182 Wis. 2d 616, 514 N.W.2d 707 (1994). Information contained in a treatment record but obtained from another source is not subject to the treatment-records privilege under this section, except that all information that identifies a person as a patient is privileged. Daniel A. v. Walter H., 195 Wis. 2d 971, 537 N.W.2d 103 (Ct. App. 1995), 92-1676. This section provides an exception to the open records law. Nothing in this section or rules adopted under this section suggests that the director is to weigh the harm to the public interest against the benefit to the public in deciding on access to records. State ex rel. Savinski v. Kimble, 221 Wis. 2d 833, 586 N.W.2d 36 (Ct. App. 1998), 97-3356. The subject individual of treatment records is the one who receives treatment. Another person mentioned in the records is not a subject individual and not protected by this section. Olson v. Red Cedar Clinic, 2004 WI App 102, 273 Wis. 2d 728, 681 N.W.2d 306, 03-2198. Statements of emergency detention in the possession of a treatment facility, or a department listed in this section, or in the possession of the police department, are “treatment records” within the meaning of sub. (1) (b), which are expressly exempt from disclosure without written informed consent or a court order under sub. (4) and thus not subject to an open records request. Watton v. Hegerty, 2008 WI 74, 311 Wis. 2d 52, 751 N.W.2d 369, 06-3092. Sub. (4) on its face, and as interpreted in Watton, 2008 WI 74, prohibits the release of copies of statements of emergency detention, even if in the possession of the police department. Applying Watton, it would be absurd to construe the plain language of sub. (4) to permit release of the police incident report when it contains the same information as the expressly confidential statement of emergency detention. Although Schuster, 144 Wis. 2d 223 (1998), imposes a duty to warn a person threatened with harm on a psychiatrist who hears the threat from a patient, it does not create a public policy exception to sub. (4). Milwaukee Deputy Sheriff’s Ass’n v. City of Wauwatosa, 2010 WI App 95, 327 Wis. 2d 206, 787 N.W.2d 438, 09-1924. Under the broad terms of sub. (7), the confidentiality requirements created under this section generally apply to “treatment records” in criminal not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI) cases. All conditional release plans in NGI cases are, by statutory definition, treatment records. They are created in the course of providing services to individuals for mental illness, and thus should be deemed confidential. An order of placement in an NGI case is not a “treatment record.” La Crosse Tribune v. Circuit Court, 2012 WI App 42, 340 Wis. 2d 663, 814 N.W.2d 867, 10-3120. This section assigns confidential status to records involving treatment for mental illness. The meaning of “shall” in sub. (4) (a) is established. If the confidentiality provision applies, a court must treat the records as confidential, unless an enumerated exception contained in sub. (4) (b) applies, or there is a circumstance that is comparable to an enumerated exception. La Crosse Tribune v. Circuit Court, 2012 WI App 42, 340 Wis. 2d 663, 814 N.W.2d 867, 10-3120. The duty to report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect under s. 48.981 (3) (a) prevails over any inconsistent terms in this section. 68 Atty. Gen. 342. Except for those services for which parental consent is necessary under s. 51.47 (2), a physician or health care facility may release outpatient or detoxification services information only with consent of a minor patient, provided the minor is 12 years of age or over. 77 Atty.

      "text": "51.423 Grants-in-aid. (1) The department shall fund, within the limits of the department’s allocation for mental health services under s. 20.435 (7) (b) and (o) and subject to this section, services for mental illness, developmental disability, alcoholism, and drug abuse to meet standards of service quality and accessibility. The department’s primary responsibility is to guarantee that county departments established under either s. 51.42 or 51.437 receive a reasonably uniform minimum level of funding and its secondary responsibility is to fund programs which meet exceptional community needs or provide specialized or innovative services. Moneys appropriated under s. 20.435 (7) (b) and earmarked by the department for mental health services under s. 20.435 (7) (o) shall be allocated by the department to county departments under s. 51.42 or 51.437 in the manner set forth in this section. (2) From the appropriations under s. 20.435 (7) (b) and (o), the department shall distribute the funding for services provided or purchased by county departments under s. 46.23, 51.42, or 51.437 to such county departments as provided under s. 46.40. County matching funds are required for the distributions under s. 46.40 (2) and (9) (b). Each county’s required match for the distributions under s. 46.40 (2) for a year equals 9.89 percent of the total of the county’s distributions under s. 46.40 (2) for that year for which matching funds are required plus the amount the county was required by s. 46.26 (2) (c), 1985 stats., to spend for juvenile delinquency-related services from its distribution for 1987. Each county’s required match for the distribution under s. 46.40 (9) (b) for a year equals 9.89 percent of that county’s amounts described in s. 46.40 (9) (ar) (intro.) for that year. Matching funds may be from county tax levies, federal and state revenue sharing funds, or private donations to the counties that meet the requirements specified in sub. (5). Private donations may not exceed 25 percent of the total county match. If the county match is less than the amount required to generate the full amount of state and federal funds distributed for this period, the decrease in the amount of state and federal funds equals the difference between the required and the actual amount of county matching funds. (4) The department shall prorate the amount allocated to any county department under sub. (2) to reflect actual federal funds available. (5) (a) A private donation to a county may be used to match the state grant-in-aid under s. 46.495 (1) (d) or under sub. (2) only if the donation is both of the following: 1. Donated to a county department under s. 46.215, 46.22, 51.42 or 51.437 and the donation is under the administrative control of such county department. 2. Donated without restrictions as to use, unless the restrictions specify that the donation be used for a particular service and the donor neither sponsors nor operates the service. (b) Voluntary federated fund-raising organizations are not sponsors or operators of services within the meaning of par. (a) 2. Any member agency of such an organization that sponsors or operates services is deemed an autonomous entity separate from the organization unless the board membership of the organization and the agency interlock. (6) The county allocation to match aid increases shall be included in the contract under s. 46.031 (2g) and approved by January 1 of the year for which the funds are allocated, in order to generate state aid matching funds. All funds allocated under sub. (2) shall be included in the contract under s. 46.031 (2g) and approved. (7) Each county department under either s. 51.42 or 51.437, but not both, shall be treated, for the purpose of this section only, as unified with any other county department established in its jurisdiction under either s. 51.42 or 51.437 and shall receive an amount determined under sub. (2). (9) If the funds appropriated under s. 20.435 (7) (b) for any fiscal year are insufficient to provide county departments with the sums calculated under subs. (1) to (7), the appropriation shall be allocated among county departments in proportion to the sums they would receive under subs. (1) to (7). (10) Each county department which is eligible under the state plan for medical assistance shall obtain a medical assistance provider number and shall bill for all eligible clients. A county department operating an inpatient facility shall apply for a special hospital license under s. 50.33 (2) (c). Under powers delegated under s. 46.10 (16), each county department shall retain 100 percent of all collections it makes and its providers make for care other than that provided or purchased by the state. (11) Each county department under s. 51.42 or 51.437, or both, shall apply all funds it receives under subs. (1) to (7) to provide the services required under ss. 51.42, 51.437 and 51.45 (2) (g) to meet the needs for service quality and accessibility of the persons in its jurisdiction, except that the county department may pay for inpatient treatment only with funds designated by the department for inpatient treatment. The county department may expand programs and services with county funds not used to match state funds under this section subject to the approval of the county board of supervisors in a county with a single-county department, except in Milwaukee County, the Milwaukee County mental health board in Milwaukee County, or the county boards of supervisors in counties with multicounty departments and with other local or private funds subject to the approval of the department and the county board of supervisors in a county with a single-county department under s. 51.42 or 51.437, the Milwaukee County mental health board with a department under s. 51.42, or the county boards of supervisors in counties with a multicounty department under s. 51.42 or 51.437. The county board of supervisors in a county with a single-county department under s. 51.42 or 51.437, the Milwaukee County mental health board with a department under s. 51.42, or the county boards of supervisors in counties with a multicounty department under s. 51.42 or 51.437 may delegate the authority to expand programs and services to the county department under s. 51.42 or 51.437. The county department under s. 51.42 or 51.437 shall report to the department all county funds allocated to the county department under s. 51.42 or 51.437 and the use of such funds. Moneys collected under s. 46.10 shall be applied to cover the costs of primary services, exceptional and specialized services or to reimburse supplemental appropriations funded by counties. County departments under ss. 51.42 and 51.437 shall include collections made on and after October 1, 1978, by the department that are subject to s. 46.10 (8m) (a) 3. and 4. and are distributed to county departments under ss. 51.42 and 51.437 from the appropriation account under s. 20.435 (5) (gg), as revenues on their grant-in-aid expenditure reports to the department. (12) The department may not provide state aid to any county department under s. 51.42 or 51.437 for excessive inpatient treatment. For each county department under ss. 51.42 and 51.437 in each calendar year, sums expended for the 22nd and all subsequent average days of care shall be deemed excessive inpatient treatment. No inpatient treatment provided to children, adolescents, chronically mentally ill patients, patients requiring specialized care at a mental health institute, or patients at the centers for the developmentally disabled may be deemed excessive. If a patient is discharged or released and then readmitted within 60 days after such discharge or release from an inpatient facility, the number of days of care following readmission shall be added to the number of days of care before discharge or release for the purpose of calculating the total length of such patient’s stay in the inpatient facility. (15) Funds allocated under this section and recovered from audit adjustments from a prior fiscal year may be included in subsequent certifications only to pay counties owed funds as a result of any audit adjustment. By June 30 of each year the department shall submit to the chief clerk of each house of the legislature, for distribution to the appropriate standing committees under s. 13.172 (3), a report on funds recovered and paid out during the previous calendar year as a result of audit adjustments.
