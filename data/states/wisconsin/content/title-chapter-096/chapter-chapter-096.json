It is declared to be the policy of this state to promote orderly and efficient marketing of agricultural commodities and to prevent economic waste of the agricultural wealth of this state. Unfair methods of competition, lack of uniform grading and classification of agricultural commodities, and the inability of individual producers to obtain present markets or to develop new or larger markets for Wisconsin agricultural commodities result in disorderly marketing of such commodities. As a result agricultural producers are prevented from receiving a fair return for the products which they market. Such conditions jeopardize the continued production of adequate food and energy supplies for this and other states, and may result in unemployment with its attendant burdens on the citizens of this state. The production, processing and marketing of agricultural commodities within this state is hereby declared to be affected with a public interest and this chapter is enacted for the purpose of protecting the health, peace, safety and general welfare of the people of this state.

The secretary shall not approve the issuance, amendment or termination of any marketing order or agreement unless the secretary finds all of the following: (a) That the proposed issuance, amendment or termination is reasonably calculated to attain the objectives sought in the proposed marketing order or agreement. (b) That the proposed issuance, amendment or termination is in conformity with this chapter. (c) That the interests of consumers of such commodity are protected in that the powers of this chapter are being exercised only to the extent necessary to attain such objectives.

(1) Each marketing order issued under this chapter shall provide for the levying and collection of assessments in sufficient amounts to defray the expenses incurred by the marketing board for program operations and administration of the order. Each marketing order shall indicate the maximum rate of any such assessment which may be collected and the proportion, if any, payable by each producer or handler directly affected by the marketing order. The marketing board may recommend to the secretary the assessment rate necessary to provide sufficient funds to cover the marketing order budget. The marketing board shall determine when assessments become due and payable and the units upon which the assessment rate applies. All assessments collected are payable to the marketing board. (2) If the secretary finds that the marketing order budget or assessment rate exceeds the limitations of, or is contrary to, the declared purposes of this chapter or the marketing order, the secretary may disapprove the budget and any amendments to the budget, or assessment rate. (3) (a) 1. Except as provided under par. (c), a corn producer who sells corn that is subject to the assessment levied under sub. (1) under the marketing order for corn shall pay an additional assessment of 0.4 cents per bushel, to be collected and remitted to the marketing board in the manner provided in the marketing order for the assessment under sub. (1). 2. If the marketing order for corn provides for rebates under s. 96.13 (2), a producer to whom subd. 1. applies may obtain a rebate of the assessment paid under subd. 1. in the manner provided in the marketing order for obtaining a rebate of the assessment levied under sub. (1). (b) The marketing board for corn shall use the moneys received under par. (a) for the purposes of the marketing order for corn. (c) 1. The department shall conduct a referendum on whether to terminate the assessment under par. (a) if after June 30, 2011, and before January 1, 2012, 10 percent of the producers who sell corn that is subject to the assessment levied under sub. (1) petition for a referendum. The assessment under par. (a) does not apply after June 30, 2012, if a referendum to terminate the assessment is approved by affected producers. 2. If the marketing order for corn is terminated, pars. (a) and (b) do not apply. History: 1981 c. 283 ss. 22, 29, 30; Stats. 1981 s. 96.11; 2007 a. 26.",

To ensure the proper collection of assessments, the marketing board may require: (1) Any person subject to the assessment to give the board adequate assurance or security for its payment.

(1) Assessments collected by the marketing board under any marketing order or as an advance deposit against the assessment shall be used by the marketing board only for the purpose of carrying out the purposes and provisions of the order, including the administrative costs. (2) A marketing order may contain a provision granting producers who have paid an assessment under the order, and who do not favor the program developed under the order, the right to receive a refund of assessments paid upon submission of proof satisfactory to the marketing board that the assessment for which a refund is requested has been paid. Claims for producer refunds must be submitted on forms prescribed by the board and filed with the board within 90 days after the date the assessment became due and payable. All claims shall be audited and paid by the board within 60 days after receipt of the claim, or within such other reasonable period of time as may be necessary to determine the validity of the claim. (3) Upon termination of any marketing order, any and all moneys remaining with the marketing board and not required to defray expenses or repay obligations incurred shall be returned to the affected producers or handlers in proportion to the assessments paid by each in the 2-year period preceding the date of the termination order. If the marketing board and the secretary find that the returnable amounts are so small that the computation and return of the remaining funds is impractical, the board may use the remaining funds to further any of the basic purposes or objectives of the terminated marketing order.
