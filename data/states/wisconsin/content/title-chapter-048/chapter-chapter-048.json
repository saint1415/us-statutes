Ct. Order, 151 Wis. 2d xxv (1989); 1989 a. 107; 1991 a. 39; 1993 a. 98, 375, 377, 385, 446, 491; 1995 a. 27 ss. 2423 to 2426p, 9126 (19), 9145 (1); 1995 a. 77, 275, 352, 448; 1997 a. 27, 104, 191, 292; 1999 a. 9; 2001 a. 16, 59, 69; 2005 a. 113, 232, 277, 344; 2005 a. 443 s. 265; 2007 a. 20; 2009 a. 28; 2009 a. 94 ss. 2 to 9, 231; 2009 a. 185 s. 86; 2009 a. 302, 334; 2013 a. 362; 2015 a. 101, 128, 196, 367; 2017 a. 34, 47, 259; 2019 a. 9, 95; 2021 a. 42; 2023 a. 119. Under sub. (13), a deceased parent continues to be a parent; a deceased parent’s parents continue to be grandparents. H.F. v. T.F., 168 Wis. 2d 62, 483 N.W.2d 803 (1992). A viable fetus is not a “person” within the definition of a child under sub. (2). State ex rel. Angela M.W. v. Kruzicki, 209 Wis. 2d 112, 561 N.W.2d 729 (1997), 95-2480. While the second sentence of sub. (13) applies exclusively to nonmarital children, the first sentence does not apply exclusively to children of married individuals. The biological father of a nonmarital child satisfies the definition of parent in sub. (13) as he is a biological parent notwithstanding that he has not officially been adjudicated as the child’s biological father. State v. James P., 2005 WI 80, 281 Wis. 2d 685, 698 N.W.2d 95, 04-0723. An interpretation of “severe bruising” under sub. (14g) that includes consideration of the circumstances surrounding the physical injury is reasonable. A child’s bruises were severe based on the combination of: 1) the sensitive location of the bruising, on the child’s skull; 2) the vulnerability of a child of the victim’s age; and 3) the means by which the court determined the bruises were created, by an adult hand pressing on the child’s skull. Kristi L.M. v. Dennis E.M., 2007 WI 85, 302 Wis. 2d 185, 734 N.W.2d 375, 05-1034. Under former sub. (13), 2007 stats., parentage may be established in one of three ways: 1) by initiating a paternity action under s. 767.80; 2) by petitioning for adoption under this chapter; or 3) by virtue of the presumption established by the artificial insemination statute. While a circuit court possesses common law authority to order visitation, it has no authority outside of the statutes to confer parental rights. Dustardy H. v. Bethany H., 2011 WI App 2, 331 Wis. 2d 158, 794 N.W.2d 230, 08-2587. Enforcement of surrogacy agreements promotes stability and permanence in family relationships because it allows the intended parents to plan for the arrival of their child, reinforces the expectations of all parties to the agreement, and reduces contentious litigation. The surrogacy agreement in this case was enforceable except for the portions of the agreement requiring a voluntary termination of parental rights (TPR). The TPR provisions did not comply with the procedural safeguards set forth in s. 48.41 for a voluntary TPR because the biological mother would not consent to the TPR and there was no legal basis for involuntary TPR. The TPR provisions were severable. Rosecky v. Schissel, 2013 WI 66, 349 Wis. 2d 84, 833 N.W.2d 634, 11-2166. Construing sub. (1) (gm) and s. 813.122 as allowing a trial court to consider evidence of the treatment a respondent obtained or steps a respondent took to ameliorate a child’s symptoms of emotional damage after the filing of the petition but prior to the injunction hearing would undercut the purpose of the injunction, which is to protect a child from an abusive situation. In light of Wisconsin’s strong and long-standing interest in the protection and well-being of its minors, interpreting these statutes in a manner that would allow a respondent to undercut the purpose of the statute would be unreasonable. S.O. v. T.R., 2016 WI App 24, 367 Wis. 2d 669, 877 N.W.2d 408, 15-0548. Evidence of the treatment obtained or steps taken by a parent, guardian, or legal custodian to address and remedy the person’s actions can benefit the child within the meaning sub. (1) (gm) and s. 813.122. However, when evidence of such actions is introduced to establish that the parent, guardian, or legal custodian has not “neglected, refused or been unable ... to obtain the necessary treatment or to take steps to ameliorate the symptoms,” there must also be testimony or other evidence showing an actual benefit to the child in terms of treating the child and ameliorating the child’s symptoms of emotional abuse. S.O. v. T.R., 2016 WI App 24, 367 Wis. 2d 669, 877 N.W.2d 408, 15-0548. Viewpoint: Wisconsin’s Undeveloped Surrogacy Law. Walsh. Wis. Law. Mar. 2012.

Except as limited by an order of the court under s. 48.977 (5) (b) or 48.978 (6) (b) 2., a person appointed by the court to be the guardian of a child under this chapter has the duty and authority to make important decisions in matters having a permanent effect on the life and development of the child and the duty to be concerned about the child’s general welfare, including but not limited to: (1) The authority to consent to marriage, enlistment in the U.S. armed forces, major medical, psychiatric and surgical treatment, and obtaining a motor vehicle operator’s license. (2) The authority to represent the child in legal actions and make other decisions of substantial legal significance concerning the child but not the authority to deny the child the assistance of counsel as required by this chapter. (3) The right and duty of reasonable visitation of the child. (4) The rights and responsibilities of legal custody except when legal custody has been vested in another person or when the child is under the supervision of the department of corrections under s. 938.183, 938.34 (4h), or 938.357 (3) or (4) or the supervision of a county department under s. 938.34 (4d), (4m), or (4n).

A guardian may not recover for the loss of society and companionship of a ward, nor may the guardian bring a separate claim for costs incurred or income lost on account of injuries to the ward. Conant v. Physicians Plus Medical Group, Inc., 229 Wis. 2d 271, 600 N.W.2d 21 (Ct. App. 1999), 98-3285. A guardian has general authority to consent to medication for a ward but may consent to psychotropic medication only in accordance with ss. 880.07 (1m) and 880.33 (4m) and (4r). The guardian’s authority to consent to medication or medical treatment of any kind is not affected by an order for protective placement or services. OAG 5-99.",
