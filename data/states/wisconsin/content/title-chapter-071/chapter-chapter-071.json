No credit may be claimed under this subdivision for property listed as a contributing building in the state register of historic places or in the national register of historic places and no credit may be claimed under this subdivision for nonhistoric, nonresidential property converted into housing if the property has been previously used for housing. (c) No person may claim the credit under par. (a) 2m. unless the claimant includes with the claimant’s return a copy of the claimant’s certification under s. 238.17. For certification purposes under s. 238.17, the claimant shall provide to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation all of the following: 1. Evidence that the rehabilitation was recommended by the state historic preservation officer for approval by the secretary of the interior under 36 CFR 67.6 before the physical work of construction, or destruction in preparation for construction, began and that the rehabilitation was approved by the state historic preservation officer. 2. Evidence that the taxpayer obtained written certification from the state historic preservation officer that: a. The property is listed on the national register of historic places in Wisconsin or the state register of historic places, or is determined by the state historical society to be eligible for listing on the national register of historic places in Wisconsin or the state register of historic places, or is located in a historic district that is listed in the national register of historic places in Wisconsin or the state register of historic places and is certified by the state historic preservation officer as being of historic significance to the district, or is an outbuilding of an otherwise eligible property certified by the state historic preservation officer as contributing to the historic significance of the property. b. The proposed preservation or rehabilitation plan complies with standards promulgated under s. 44.02 (24) and the completed preservation or rehabilitation substantially complies with the proposed plan. c. The costs are not incurred to acquire any building or interest in a building or to enlarge an existing building. d. The costs were not incurred before the state historical society approved the proposed preservation or rehabilitation plan. (cm) Any credit claimed under this subsection for Wisconsin purposes shall be claimed at the same time as for federal purposes. (cn) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation shall certify a person to claim a credit under par. (a) 3. if all of the following apply: 1. The corporation previously certified the person to claim a credit under par. (a) 3. for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 2015. 2. The proposed project for which the person wishes to claim a credit under this paragraph for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014, is located in the city of Green Bay. 3. The proposed project described under subd. 2. is located on the same parcel as the project for which the person received certification under subd. 1. or on a parcel that is contiguous to the project for which the person received certification under subd. 1. 4. The corporation determines that the person is eligible to claim the credit under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code for the qualified rehabilitation expenses incurred for the project for which the person received certification under subd. 1. (d) The Wisconsin adjusted basis of the building shall be reduced by the amount of any credit awarded under this subsection. The Wisconsin adjusted basis of a partner’s interest in a partnership, of a member’s interest in a limited liability company or of stock in a tax-option corporation shall be adjusted to take into account adjustments made under this paragraph. (e) The provisions of s. 71.28 (4) (e), (f), (g) and (h), as they apply to the credit under s. 71.28 (4), apply to the credit under this subsection. (f) A partnership, limited liability company, or tax-option corporation may not claim the credit under this subsection. The partners of a partnership, members of a limited liability company, or shareholders in a tax-option corporation may claim the credit under this subsection based on eligible costs incurred by the partnership, company, or tax-option corporation. The partnership, limited liability company, or tax-option corporation shall calculate the amount of the credit which may be claimed by each partner, member, or shareholder and shall provide that information to the partner, member, or shareholder. For shareholders of a tax-option corporation, the credit may be allocated in proportion to the ownership interest of each shareholder. Credits computed by a partnership or limited liability company may be claimed in proportion to the ownership interests of the partners or members or allocated to partners or members as provided in a written agreement among the partners or members that is entered into no later than the last day of the taxable year of the partnership or limited liability company, for which the credit is claimed. For a partnership or limited liability company that places property in service after June 29, 2008, and before January 1, 2009, the credit attributable to such property may be allocated, at the election of the partnership or limited liability company, to partners or members for a taxable year of the partnership or limited liability company that ends after June 29, 2008, and before January 1, 2010. Any partner or member who claims the credit as provided under this paragraph shall attach a copy of the agreement, if applicable, to the tax return on which the credit is claimed. A person claiming the credit as provided under this paragraph is solely responsible for any tax liability arising from a dispute with the department of revenue related to claiming the credit. (g) 1. If a person who claims the credit under this subsection elects to claim the credit based on claiming amounts for expenditures as the expenditures are paid, rather than when the rehabilitation work is completed, the person shall file an election form with the department, in the manner prescribed by the department. 2. Notwithstanding s. 71.77, the department may adjust or disallow the credit claimed under this subsection within 4 years after the date that the state historical society notifies the department that the expenditures for which the credit was claimed do not comply with the standards for certification promulgated under s. 44.02 (24). If the department adjusts or disallows, in whole or in part, a credit transferred under par. (h), only the person who originally transferred the credit to another person is liable to repay the adjusted or disallowed amount. (h) Any person, including a nonprofit entity described in section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code, may sell or otherwise transfer the credit under par. (a) 2m. or 3., in whole or in part, to another person who is subject to the taxes imposed under s. 71.02, 71.23, or 71.43, if the person notifies the department of the transfer, and submits with the notification a copy of the transfer documents, and the department certifies ownership of the credit with each transfer. The transferor may file a claim for more than one taxable year on a form prescribed by the department to compute all years of the credit under par. (a) 2m. or 3., at the time of the transfer request. The transferee may first use the credit to offset tax in the taxable year of the transferor in which the transfer occurs and may use the credit only to offset tax in taxable years otherwise allowed to be claimed and carried forward by the original claimant. (i) If a person who claims a credit under this subsection and a credit under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code for the same qualified rehabilitation expenditures is required to repay any amount of the credit claimed under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code, the person shall repay to the department a proportionate amount of the credit claimed under this subsection. (9r) State historic rehabilitation credit. (a) For taxable years beginning on or after August 1, 1988, any natural person may credit against taxes otherwise due under s. 71.02 an amount equal to 25 percent of the costs of preservation or rehabilitation of historic property located in this state, including architectural fees and costs incurred in preparing nomination forms for listing in the national register of historic places in Wisconsin or the state register of historic places, if the nomination is made within 5 years prior to submission of a preservation or rehabilitation plan under par. (b) 3. b., and if the physical work of construction or destruction in preparation for construction begins after December 31, 1988, except that the credit may not exceed $10,000, or $5,000 for married persons filing separately, for any preservation or rehabilitation project. (b) The department of revenue shall approve the credit under this subsection if all of the following conditions are met: 1. The costs are incurred and the claim is submitted by the owner of the historic property. 1m. The costs included in the claim relate only to preservation or rehabilitation work done to any of the following: a. The exterior of the historic property. b. The interior of a window sash if work is done to the exterior of the window sash. c. Structural elements of the historic property. d. The heating or ventilating systems. e. Electrical or plumbing systems, but not electrical or plumbing fixtures. 2. The historic property, including outbuildings that contribute to the significance of the historic property, is an owner-occupied personal residence if the residence is not actively used in a trade or business, held for the production of income or held for sale or other disposition in the ordinary course of the claimant’s trade or business. 3. The state historical society certifies that: a. The property is listed on the national register of historic places in Wisconsin or the state register of historic places, or is determined by the state historical society to be eligible for listing on the national register of historic places in Wisconsin or the state register of historic places, or is located in a historic district which is listed in the national register of historic places in Wisconsin or the state register of historic places and is certified by the state historic preservation officer as being of historic significance to the district, or is an outbuilding of an otherwise eligible property certified by the state historic preservation officer as contributing to the historic significance of the property. b. The proposed preservation or rehabilitation plan complies with standards promulgated under s. 44.02 (24) and the completed preservation or rehabilitation substantially complies with the proposed plan. 4. The preservation or rehabilitation work is completed within 2 years after the date that the physical work of construction or destruction in preparation for construction begins, except in the case of any preservation or rehabilitation which is initially planned for completion in phases, in which case the work shall be completed within 5 years after the date that the physical work of construction or destruction in preparation for construction begins. 5. The expenditures for preservation or rehabilitation of the historic property exceed $10,000. 6. The costs are not incurred to acquire any building or interest in a building or to enlarge existing building. 7. The costs were not incurred before the state historical society approved the proposed preservation or rehabilitation plan under subd. 3. b. (c) The Wisconsin adjusted basis of the historic property shall be reduced by the amount of any credit awarded under this subsection. (f) No natural person may claim a credit under this subsection and under sub. (9m) for the same expenses. (g) The provisions of s. 71.28 (4) (f), (g) and (h), as they apply to the credit under s. 71.28 (4), apply to the credit under this subsection. (i) If the historic property is owned by 2 or more natural persons that hold legal title or equitable title as a land contract vendee and are not joint tenants, tenants in common or spouses owning marital property, the credit under this subsection may be claimed as follows: 1. For projects benefiting one owner, a natural person may claim the credit based on eligible costs incurred individually. 2. For projects benefiting 2 or more owners, a natural person may claim the credit based on eligible costs incurred by the benefiting owners in proportion to the natural person’s ownership interest. (j) No natural person may claim the credit under this subsection for rehabilitation of historic property if the historic property was acquired by the claimant under an agreement requiring the claimant to sell or otherwise dispose of the historic property back to the previous owner within 5 years after the date that the historic property was acquired. (k) A natural person who receives a credit under this subsection shall add to his or her liability for taxes imposed under s. 71.02 one of the following percentages of the amount of the credits received under this subsection for rehabilitating or preserving the property if, within 5 years after the date on which the preservation or rehabilitation work that was the basis of the credit is completed, the person either sells or conveys the property by deed or land contract or the state historical society certifies to the department of revenue that the historic property has been altered to the extent that it does not comply with the standards promulgated under s. 44.02 (24): 1. If the sale, conveyance or noncompliance occurs during the first year after the date on which the preservation or rehabilitation is completed, 100 percent. 2. If the sale, conveyance or noncompliance occurs during the 2nd year after the date on which the preservation or rehabilitation is completed, 80 percent. 3. If the sale, conveyance or noncompliance occurs during the 3rd year after the date on which the preservation or rehabilitation is completed, 60 percent. 4. If the sale, conveyance or noncompliance occurs during the 4th year after the date on which the preservation or rehabilitation is completed, 40 percent. 5. If the sale, conveyance or noncompliance occurs during the 5th year after the date on which the preservation or rehabilitation is completed, 20 percent.

(cm) Any credit claimed under this subsection for Wisconsin purposes shall be claimed at the same time as for federal purposes. (cn) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation shall certify a person to claim a credit under par. (a) 3. if all of the following apply: 1. The corporation previously certified the person to claim a credit under par. (a) 3. for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 2015. 2. The proposed project for which the person wishes to claim a credit under this paragraph for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014, is located in the city of Green Bay. 3. The proposed project described under subd. 2. is located on the same parcel as the project for which the person received certification under subd. 1. or on a parcel that is contiguous to the project for which the person received certification under subd. 1. 4. The corporation determines that the person is eligible to claim the credit under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code for the qualified rehabilitation expenses incurred for the project for which the person received certification under subd. 1. (d) The Wisconsin adjusted basis of the building shall be reduced by the amount of any credit awarded under this subsection. The Wisconsin adjusted basis of a partner’s interest in a partnership, of a member’s interest in a limited liability company or of stock in a tax-option corporation shall be adjusted to take into account adjustments made under this paragraph. (e) The provisions of sub. (4) (e), (f), (g) and (h), as they apply to the credit under that subsection, apply to the credit under this subsection. (f) A partnership, limited liability company, or tax-option corporation may not claim the credit under this subsection. The partners of a partnership, members of a limited liability company, or shareholders in a tax-option corporation may claim the credit under this subsection based on eligible costs incurred by the partnership, limited liability company, or tax-option corporation. The partnership, limited liability company, or tax-option corporation shall calculate the amount of the credit which may be claimed by each partner, member, or shareholder and shall provide that information to the partner, member, or shareholder. For shareholders of a tax-option corporation, the credit may be allocated in proportion to the ownership interest of each shareholder. Credits computed by a partnership or limited liability company may be claimed in proportion to the ownership interests of the partners or members or allocated to partners or members as provided in a written agreement among the partners or members that is entered into no later than the last day of the taxable year of the partnership or limited liability company, for which the credit is claimed. For a partnership or limited liability company that places property in service after June 29, 2008, and before January 1, 2009, the credit attributable to such property may be allocated, at the election of the partnership or limited liability company, to partners or members for a taxable year of the partnership or limited liability company that ends after June 29, 2008, and before January 1, 2010. Any partner or member who claims the credit as provided under this paragraph shall attach a copy of the agreement, if applicable, to the tax return on which the credit is claimed. A person claiming the credit as provided under this paragraph is solely responsible for any tax liability arising from a dispute with the department of revenue related to claiming the credit. (g) 1. If a person who claims the credit under this subsection elects to claim the credit based on claiming amounts for expenditures as the expenditures are paid, rather than when the rehabilitation work is completed, the person shall file an election form with the department, in the manner prescribed by the department. 2. Notwithstanding s. 71.77, the department may adjust or disallow the credit claimed under this subsection within 4 years after the date that the state historical society notifies the department that the expenditures for which the credit was claimed do not comply with the standards for certification promulgated under s. 44.02 (24). If the department adjusts or disallows, in whole or in part, a credit transferred under par. (h), only the person who originally transferred the credit to another person is liable to repay the adjusted or disallowed amount. (h) Any person, including a nonprofit entity described in section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code, may sell or otherwise transfer the credit under par. (a) 2m. or 3., in whole or in part, to another person who is subject to the taxes imposed under s. 71.02, 71.23, or 71.43, if the person notifies the department of the transfer, and submits with the notification a copy of the transfer documents, and the department certifies ownership of the credit with each transfer. The transferor may file a claim for more than one taxable year on a form prescribed by the department to compute all years of the credit under par. (a) 2m. or 3., at the time of the transfer request. The transferee may first use the credit to offset tax in the taxable year of the transferor in which the transfer occurs, and may use the credit only to offset tax in taxable years otherwise allowed to be claimed and carried forward by the original claimant. (i) If a person who claims a credit under this subsection and a credit under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code for the same qualified rehabilitation expenditures is required to repay any amount of the credit claimed under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code, the person shall repay to the department a proportionate amount of the credit claimed under this subsection.
