      "text": "105.01 Definitions. As used in this chapter: (1) “Employment agent” means all persons who furnish to persons seeking employment, information enabling or tending to enable such persons to secure the same, or who furnish employers seeking laborers or other help of any kind, information enabling or tending to enable such employers to secure such help, or who keep a register of persons seeking employment or help as aforesaid, whether such agents conduct their operations at a fixed place of business, on the streets or as transients, and also whether such operations constitute the principal business of such agents or only a sideline or an incident to another business. Employment agent does not include: (a) Any employer who procures help for himself or herself only or an employee of such an employer who procures help for the employer and does not act in a similar capacity for any other employer. (b) Any temporary help service defined as any person employing individuals to render part-time or temporary services to, for or under the direction of a 3rd person, if: 1. The person employing the individuals in addition to wages or salaries pays federal social security taxes, state and federal unemployment contributions or taxes, carries worker’s compensation insurance as required by state law and maintains liability insurance covering the acts of its employees while rendering services to, for or under the direction of a 3rd person; and 2. The employer’s contracts with its employees do not contain any provision requiring the forfeiture or payment of any amount by the employee as liquidated damages upon the acceptance of permanent employment by an employee with a 3rd person who has received the employee’s part-time or temporary services. (c) Any hiring hall operated by a bona fide labor union. (d) Any theatrical or booking agent. (e) An employment counselor. (f) A person whose fees or charges are paid entirely by an employer. (2) “Employment counselor” means any placement manager, placement director, interviewer or any other person employed by an employment agency who interviews, counsels or confers with job applicants or employers for the purpose of placing or procuring job applicants. This term does not include employees of an employment agency who are primarily engaged in clerical or administrative occupations. History: 1973 c. 226; 1975 c. 147 s. 54; 1977 c. 26; 1989 a. 220; 1993 a. 492. As evidenced by the exclusion of employer-paid agents from the definition of employment agents in sub. (1) and by the paucity of provisions applying to employer-paid agents versus employment agents in ch. 105 and the Wisconsin Administrative Code, the only reasonable inference that can be drawn is that the legislature saw less need to protect the public interest from inappropriate actions of employer-paid employment agents and consequently intended to apply less stringent supervision over them. A contract made with an employer-paid agent is void if that agent is not registered with the state at the time of execution and performance of the contract. Kleewood, Inc. v. Hart Design & Mfg., Inc. 2006 WI App 264, 297 Wis. 2d 794, 727 N.W.2d 87, 06-0416.",

No employment agent or any employee or agent thereof, shall divide or offer to divide, or share directly or indirectly, any fee, charge or compensation received from any applicant for employment, with any employer, superintendent, manager, foreman, or any other person who hires help or to whom help is furnished by an employment agent; and it shall be unlawful for any employer, superintendent, manager, foreman, or any other person who hires help to receive any compensation or any valuable consideration from any applicant for employment or from any employment agent for giving employment to said applicant or to any employees furnished by said employment agent. Employee agreements to repay training costs paid by or received from an employer are subject to reasonableness requirements similar to restrictive covenants and will be scrutinized in terms of amount, duration, schedule of repayment, credit for time worked, and other terms to ensure that the conditions are reasonably necessary to protect the employer’s interest and are commensurate with the benefit secured by the employee.
