      "text": "121.004 Definitions. In this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (1) Average daily membership. “Average daily membership” is the sum of all pupils enrolled in all schools of the school district for each day of the school term, divided by the number of days school is actually taught. If it contains a fraction, the quotient shall be expressed as the nearest whole number. (2) Equalized valuation. The “equalized valuation” of a school district is the full value of the taxable property of the territory in the school district as certified for the prior year under s. 121.06 (2), excluding value adjustments made under s. 70.57 (1) resulting from appeals made under s. 70.995. The “equalized valuation” of any taxable property in a tax incremental district shall not exceed its equalized value determined for the purpose of obtaining the tax incremental base of that district under s. 66.1105. The “equalized valuation” of a school district shall be reduced by the amount of an environmental remediation value increment on a parcel of property that is certified under s. 66.1106 during the period of certification. (3) Fund. “Fund” is an independent accounting entity, as prescribed under s. 115.28 (13). (4) Gross cost. The “gross cost” of a fund means the sum of all nonduplicative expenditures from and other financing uses of that fund. (5) Membership. “Membership” for any school district is the sum of pupils enrolled as reported under s. 121.05 (1) or (2), as appropriate, and the summer average daily membership equivalent for those academic summer classes, interim session classes, and laboratory periods approved for necessary academic purposes under s. 121.14 (1) (a) 1. and 2. and those online classes described in s. 121.14 (1) (a) 3. (6) Net cost. The “net cost” of a fund means the gross cost of that fund minus all nonduplicative revenues and other financing sources of that fund except property taxes, general aid, and aid received under ss. 79.095 (4) and 79.096. In this subsection, “nonduplicative revenues” includes federal financial assistance under 20 USC 236 to 245, to the extent permitted under federal law and regulations. (7) Pupils enrolled. (a) “Pupils enrolled” is the total number of pupils, as expressed by official enrollments, in all schools of the school district, except as provided in pars. (b) to (f). If such total contains a fraction, it shall be expressed as the nearest whole number. The same method shall be used in computing the number of pupils enrolled for resident pupils, nonresident pupils or both. (b) A first grade pupil may be counted only if the pupil attains the age permitted under s. 120.12 (25) or required under s. 118.14 for first grade admission. (c) 1. A pupil enrolled in kindergarten may be counted only if the pupil attains the age permitted under s. 120.12 (25) or required under s. 118.14 for kindergarten admission. A 5-year-old kindergarten pupil shall be counted as one-half pupil except that: a. A pupil enrolled in a 5-year-old kindergarten program that requires full-day attendance by the pupil for 5 days a week, but not on any day of the week that pupils enrolled in other grades in the school do not attend school, for an entire school term shall be counted as one pupil. b. A pupil enrolled in a 5-year-old kindergarten program that requires full-day attendance by the pupil for less than 5 days a week for an entire school term shall be counted as the result obtained by multiplying the number of hours in each day in which the pupil is enrolled by the total number of days for which the pupil is enrolled, and dividing the result by the total number of hours of attendance required of first grade pupils in the school district. 2. In subd. 1. a. and b., “full-day” means the length of the school day for pupils in the first grade of the school district operating the 5-year-old kindergarten program. (cm) A pupil enrolled in a 4-year-old kindergarten program that provides the required number of hours of direct pupil instruction under s. 121.02 (1) (f) shall be counted as 0.6 pupil. (d) A pupil enrolled in a preschool program under subch. V of ch. 115 who is 3 years of age or older shall be counted as one-half pupil. (e) A pupil attending public school under s. 118.145 (4) shall be counted as the result obtained by dividing the number of hours of direct pupil instruction scheduled for the pupil at the public school during the school year by the number of hours of direct pupil instruction that the school district scheduled for a pupil in the same grade during the school year. (em) A pupil attending public school outside his or her school district of residence under s. 118.53 shall be counted as 0.25 pupil for each course the pupil attends at the public school during the school year. A pupil attending public school in his or her school district of residence under s. 118.53 shall be counted as the result obtained by dividing the number of hours of direct pupil instruction scheduled for the pupil at the public school during the school year by the number of hours of direct pupil instruction that the school district scheduled for a pupil in the same grade during the school year. (f) A pupil who transfers from one school district to another under s. 121.85 (3) (a) shall be counted by the school district in which the pupil resides as 0.75 pupil or, if appropriate, as a number equal to the result obtained by multiplying 0.75 by the appropriate fraction under par. (c), (cm) or (d). (8) Summer average daily membership equivalent. “Summer average daily membership equivalent” is a number determined by dividing the sum of the following by 48,600: (a) The total number of minutes in which pupils are enrolled in academic summer classes, interim session classes, or laboratory periods, as defined by the state superintendent under s. 121.14. (b) The sum of the number of minutes of online class instruction completed per pupil for each high school pupil and each pupil in the 7th or 8th grade who completes an online summer class or an online interim session class offered by a school district if all of the following are satisfied: 1. The online class is offered by a school district. 2. The pupil receiving instruction in the online class resides in the school district under subd. 1. or is attending that school district under s. 118.51. 3. a. If the pupil receiving instruction in the online class is enrolled in a high school grade, the pupil receives credit for completion of the class. b. If the pupil receiving instruction in the online class is enrolled in the 7th or 8th grade, the pupil successfully completed the class. 4. The school board of the school district under subd. 1. determines that the online class fulfills a requirement for high school graduation specified under s. 118.33 (1) (a) 1. or 2. or established by the school board under s. 118.33 (1) (am) or the authority of the department. (9) Teacher-pupil ratio. “Teacher-pupil ratio” is the quotient of the number of pupils enrolled divided by the number of teachers employed. (10) Teachers employed. “Teacher” means a person holding a license or certificate under s. 115.28 (7), but does not include any person under s. 115.29 (3). In computing the number of teachers employed, professional workers who devote less than full time to their professional duties shall be counted in proportion to the time devoted to such duties. Teachers who devote full time to children with disabilities shall not be counted.

      "text": "121.01 Purpose. It is declared to be the policy of this state that education is a state function and that some relief should be afforded from the local general property tax as a source of public school revenue where such tax is excessive, and that other sources of revenue should contribute a larger percentage of the total funds needed. It is further declared that in order to provide reasonable equality of educational opportunity for all the children of this state, the state must guarantee that a basic educational opportunity be available to each pupil, but that the state should be obligated to contribute to the educational program only if the school district provides a program which meets state standards. It is the purpose of the state aid formula set forth in this subchapter to cause the state to assume a greater proportion of the costs of public education and to relieve the general property of some of its tax burden. The school finance system under this chapter is constitutional under both article I, section 1 and article X, section 3, of the Wisconsin Constitution. Students have a fundamental right to an equal opportunity for a sound basic education. Uniform revenue-raising capacity among districts is not required. Vincent v. Voight, 2000 WI 93, 236 Wis. 2d 588, 614 N.W.2d 388, 97-3174. A “Uniform” Education: Reform of Local Property Tax School Finance Systems Through State Constitutions. Kaster. 62 MLR 565 (1979).",

      "text": "121.51 Definitions. In this subchapter: (1) “Attendance area” is the geographic area designated by the governing body of a private school as the area from which its pupils attend and approved by the school board of the district in which the private school is located. If the private school and the school board cannot agree on the attendance area, the state superintendent shall, upon the request of the private school and the board, make a final determination of the attendance area. The attendance areas of private schools affiliated with the same religious denomination shall not overlap unless one school limits its enrollment to pupils of the same sex and the other school limits its enrollment to pupils of the opposite sex or admits pupils of both sexes. (3) “School board” has the meaning designated in s. 115.001 (7) and includes any governmental agency transporting children to and from public schools. (4) “School bus” has the meaning designated in s. 340.01 (56). History: 1975 c. 120; 1983 a. 189 ss. 185, 329 (17); 1983 a. 512; 1989 a. 31; 1995 a. 27 s. 9145 (1); 1997 a. 27. The provision for the transportation, at public expense, of students to and from private schools on an attendance area basis is constitutional. State ex rel. Vanko v. Kahl, 52 Wis. 2d 206, 188 N.W.2d 460 (1971). For purposes of sub. (4) [now sub. (1)], and in the absence of fraud or collusion, when a religious school demonstrates by its corporate charter and bylaws that it is independent of, and unaffiliated with, a religious denomination, further inquiry by the state would violate article I, section 18, of the Wisconsin Constitution. Holy Trinity Community School, Inc. v. Kahl, 82 Wis. 2d 139, 262 N.W.2d 210 (1978). But see St. Augustine School v. Taylor, 2021 WI 70, 398 Wis. 2d 92, 961 N.W.2d 635, 21-0265. In determining whether schools are “affiliated with the same religious denomination” under sub. (1), the state superintendent is not limited to consideration of a school’s corporate documents exclusively. In conducting a neutral and secular inquiry, the state superintendent may also consider the professions of the school with regard to the school’s self-identification and affiliation, but the state superintendent may not conduct any investigation or surveillance with respect to the school’s religious beliefs, practices, or teachings. St. Augustine School v. Taylor, 2021 WI 70, 398 Wis. 2d 92, 961 N.W.2d 635, 21-0265. The Wisconsin statutes do not permit a finding of affiliation under sub. (1) based on a public official’s assessment of how close in doctrine two sectarian schools may be. However difficult it may be, that decision must be made on neutral and secular grounds. The state superintendent may not delve into the nuances of the religious differences that pervade our country and withhold state benefits for reasons that can be tied to the religious preference of the disfavored group. Yet that is what reliance on the label “Catholic” entailed in this case, even if only modestly. Given the fluidity of religious labels and this country’s firm commitment to personal choice and religious diversity, it may be impossible to decide that two entities are affiliated by looking solely at the fact that they both use the same label. Moreover, the state superintendent was not entitled to accept the private school’s self-characterization as Catholic, while at the same time to reject its vociferous insistence that its understanding of what it means to be Catholic is significantly different from that of the diocesan schools. Neither representation was more or less important to the private school’s self-identification. St. Augustine School v. Underly, 21 F.4th 446 (2021).
