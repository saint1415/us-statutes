It is the intent of this subchapter to encourage a policy of protecting from destructive or premature cutting the forest growth in this state, and of reproducing and growing for the future adequate crops through sound forestry practices of forest products on lands not more useful for other purposes, so that such lands shall continue to furnish recurring forest crops for commercial use with public hunting and fishing as extra public benefits, all in a manner which shall not hamper the towns in which such lands lie from receiving their just tax revenue from such lands. History: 1971 c. 215; 1985 a. 332 s. 251 (2). Requests by individual legislators and town or county boards for delay in issuing orders pursuant to this chapter present no basis for withholding actions by the department. 61 Atty. Gen. 134.",

      "text": "77.04 Taxation. (1) Tax roll. The clerk on making up the tax roll shall enter as to each forest cropland description in a special column or some other appropriate place in such tax roll headed by the words “Forest Croplands” or the initials “F.C.L.”, which shall be a sufficient designation that such description is subject to this subchapter. Such land shall thereafter be assessed and be subject to review under ch. 70, and such assessment may be used by the department of revenue in the determination of the tax upon withdrawal of such lands as forest croplands as provided in s. 77.10 for entries prior to 1972 or for any entry under s. 77.02 (4) (a). The tax upon withdrawal of descriptions entered as forest croplands after December 31, 1971, may be determined by the department of revenue by multiplying the last assessed value of the land prior to the time of the entry by an annual ratio computed for the state under sub. (2) to establish the annual assessed value of the description. No tax shall be levied on forest croplands except the specific annual taxes as provided, except that any building located on forest cropland shall be assessed as real property, subject to all laws and regulations for the assessment and taxation of general property. (2) Tax per acre; payment; penalty. The “acreage share” shall be computed at the rate of 10 cents per acre on all lands entered prior to 1972 or entered under s. 77.02 (4) (a). On all lands entered after December 31, 1971, the “acreage share” shall be computed every 10 years to the nearest cent by the department of revenue at the rate of 20 cents per acre multiplied by a ratio using the equalized value of the combined residential, commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, undeveloped, agricultural forest, and productive forest land classes under s. 70.32 (2) within the state in 1972 as the denominator, and using equalized value for these combined land classes in 1982 and every 10th year thereafter as the numerator. All owners shall pay to the taxation district treasurer the acreage share on each description on or before January 31. If the acreage share is not paid when due to the taxation district treasurer it shall be subject to interest and penalty as provided under ss. 74.11 (11), 74.12 (10) and 74.47. These lands shall be returned as delinquent and a tax certificate under subch. VII of ch. 74 shall be issued on them. After 2 years from the date of the issuance of a tax certificate, the county clerk shall promptly take a tax deed under ch. 75. On taking such deed the county clerk shall certify that fact and specify the descriptions to the department of natural resources. (3) Apportionment of forest cropland income. Out of all moneys received by any town from any source on account of forest croplands in such town, the town treasurer shall on or before November 15 pay 20 percent to the county treasurer and retain the remainder.

      "text": "77.06 Forestation. (1) Cutting timber regulated. (a) No person shall cut any merchantable wood products on any forest croplands where the forest crop taxes are delinquent nor until 30 days after the owner has filed with the department of natural resources a notice of intention to cut, specifying by descriptions and the estimated amount of wood products to be removed and the proportion of present volume to be left as growing stock in the area to be cut. Merchantable wood products include all wood products except wood used for fuel by the owner. (b) 1. The department of natural resources, after examination of the lands specified in the notice of intention to cut, may prescribe the amount of forest products to be removed, except as provided under subd. 2. 2. The department of natural resources may not prescribe the amount of forest products to be cut if the notice of intention to cut was provided to the department by any of the following: a. A cooperating forester authorized under s. 28.05 to assist the state in the harvesting and sale of timber. b. A forester accredited by the Society of American Foresters, Association of Consulting Foresters, or Wisconsin Consulting Foresters. c. A person who holds at least a bachelor’s degree from a forestry program provided by a nationally or regionally accredited institution of higher education and who has 5 years of experience engaged in the full-time profession of managing forests, including timber harvesting, wildlife management, water quality, and recreation to maintain a healthy and productive forest. d. A person who holds a degree or diploma from a 2-year forestry program provided by an accredited technical or vocational school and who has 5 years of experience engaged in the full-time profession of managing forests, including timber harvesting, wildlife management, water quality, and recreation to maintain a healthy and productive forest. e. A person who has 5 years of experience engaged in the full-time profession of managing forests, including timber harvesting, wildlife management, water quality, and recreation to maintain a healthy and productive forest. (c) Cutting in excess of the amount prescribed by the department of natural resources, or cutting that the department finds is inconsistent with sound forestry practices, shall render the owner liable to a forfeiture equal to 20 percent of the value of the timber cut and subject to cancellation under s. 77.10. (2) Appraisal of timber, zones. Each year the department of natural resources, at the time and place it shall fix and after such public notice as it deems reasonable, shall hold a public hearing. After the hearing the department shall make and file, open to public inspection, a determination of the reasonable stumpage values of the wood products usually grown in the several towns in which any forest croplands lie. A public hearing under this section shall be held prior to August 1 of each year and the determination of stumpage values made by the department of natural resources shall take effect on November 1 of that year. If the department of natural resources finds there is a material variance in the stumpage values in the different localities, it may fix separate zones and determine the values for each zone. (3) Revaluation. As to any locality or zone in which the department of natural resources deems there has been no material variance from the preceding year in stumpage values, it may omit to make any new valuation in any year, in which event the last preceding valuation shall continue in force until changed in a succeeding year. (4) Cutting reported. Within 30 days after completion of cutting on any land description, but not more than one year after filing of the notice of intention to cut, the owner shall transmit to the department of natural resources on forms provided by the department a written statement of the products so cut, specifying the variety of wood, kind of product, and quantity of each variety and kind as shown by the scale or measurement thereof made on the ground as cut, skidded, loaded, delivered, or by tree scale certified by a qualified forester when stumpage is sold by tree measurement. The department of natural resources may accept such reports as sufficient evidence of the facts, or may either with or without hearing and notice of time and place thereof to such owner, investigate and determine the fact of the quantity of each variety and kind of product so cut during said periods preceding such reports.

Whether articles of personal property are fixtures and thus real estate is determined by the following tests: 1) actual physical annexation to the real estate; 2) application or adaptation to the use or purpose to which the realty is devoted; and 3) an intention on the part of the person making the annexation to make a permanent accession to the freehold.

For the use tax to apply to intercompany transfers with wholly-owned subsidiaries, the subsidiaries that transferred the fixed assets must be considered “retailers” under sub. (13). It is not the case that Wisconsin has a statutory scheme that taxes all transfers of tangible personal property, unless an explicit exemption applies. When the person transferring tangible personal property lacks mercantile intent, the person will not be subject to tax, even though no explicit exemption applies. DOR v.

If the segments are charged separately, the sale of a private communication service that represents segments of a communications channel between 2 customer channel termination points that are located in different taxing jurisdictions for sales and use tax purposes is sourced to an equal percentage in both such jurisdictions. 4. If the segments are not charged separately, the sale of a private communication service for segments of a communications channel that is located in more than one taxing jurisdiction for sales and use tax purposes is sourced to each such jurisdiction in a percentage determined by dividing the number of customer channel termination points in that jurisdiction by the number of customer channel termination points in all jurisdictions where segments of the communications channel are located. (i) The sale of an ancillary service is sourced to the customer’s place of primary use. (j) If the location of the customer’s service address, channel termination point, or place of primary use is not known, the location where the seller receives or hands off the signal shall be considered, for purposes of this section, the customer’s service address, channel termination point, or place of primary use.
