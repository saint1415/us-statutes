Except as otherwise provided, chs. 5 to 12 shall be construed to give effect to the will of the electors, if that can be ascertained from the proceedings, notwithstanding informality or failure to fully comply with some of their provisions. (2) General provisions of election laws apply. The general provisions of chs. 5 to 12 apply to all elections. (3) Plurality shall elect. (a) Except as provided in par. (b), in every election to choose any officer, each elector has one vote for each office unless clearly indicated otherwise. The person receiving the greatest number of legal votes for the office shall be declared elected, and the canvassers shall so determine and certify. (b) In an election to fill a nonpartisan state office, if no names are certified to appear on the ballot, no person may be declared elected. (4) Tie vote. (a) If 2 or more candidates for the same office receive the greatest, but an equal number of votes, the winner shall be chosen by lot in the presence of the board of canvassers charged with the responsibility to determine the election, or in the case of an election for state or national office or metropolitan sewerage commissioner, if the commissioner is elected under s. 200.09 (11) (am), in the presence of the chairperson of the elections commission or the chairperson’s designee. (b) If, in a primary, 2 or more candidates receive an equal but not the greatest number of votes so that only one of those candidates with equal votes may advance to the final election, the choice shall similarly be made by drawing lots. (c) The candidates may, if all those tied for the same office are present, draw for themselves. Upon refusal or absence of any of the candidates, the board of canvassers shall appoint a competent person to draw, and upon the results declare and certify the winner. (d) If a question is submitted to the electors and an equal number of votes are cast for and against adoption, the question fails adoption. (5) Election of governor and lieutenant governor. (a) In every general election to choose the governor and the lieutenant governor, each elector shall have a single vote applicable to both offices. The persons receiving the greatest number of legal votes cast jointly for them for governor and lieutenant governor shall be declared elected, and the canvassers shall so determine and certify. (b) In case 2 or more slates have an equal and the highest number of votes for governor and lieutenant governor, the 2 houses of the legislature shall at the next annual session choose by joint ballot one of the slates so having an equal and the highest number of votes for governor and lieutenant governor. History: 1979 c. 89; 1983 a. 484; 1985 a. 304; 1997 a. 27; 1999 a. 150 s. 672; 1999 a. 182; 2015 a. 118. The supreme court has quite consistently construed the provisions of election statutes as directory rather than mandatory so as to preserve the will of the elector. Lanser v. Koconis, 62 Wis. 2d 86, 214 N.W.2d 425 (1974). When 40 percent of registered voters were denied ballots in an election to remove a county seat, the election was set aside even though the outcome probably was not affected. McNally v. Tollander, 100 Wis. 2d 490, 302 N.W.2d 440 (1981). Sub. (1) applies only after an election has been held and the will of the people manifested. City of Chippewa Falls v. Town of Hallie, 231 Wis. 2d 85, 604 N.W.2d 300 (Ct. App. 1999), 99-0832. Only substantial violations of the election law should operate to vacate an election. Carlson v. Oconto County Board of Canvassers, 2001 WI App 20, 240 Wis. 2d 438, 623 N.W.2d 195, 00-1788.",

History: 1971 c. 211; 1971 c. 304 ss. 2, 29 (2); 1973 c. 280, 334; 1975 c. 93; 1977 c. 107, 187, 394; 1977 c. 427 ss. 3 to 14; 1977 c. 449; 1979 c. 32, 89, 221; 1979 c. 260 ss. 1m, 73 to 75; 1979 c. 311, 328; 1981 c. 4, 391; 1983 a. 484 ss. 5, 5c, 124m, 128; 1985 a. 303; 1985 a. 304 ss. 1m, 2, 155; 1987 a. 391 ss. 1 to 1r, 66w; 1989 a. 31; 1991 a. 5; 1993 a. 140, 184; 1995 a. 16 s. 2; 1995 a. 27 s. 9145 (1); 1995 a. 219; 1997 a. 35; 2001 a. 16, 109; 2003 a. 24, 265; 2005 a. 177, 451; 2007 a. 1; 2009 a. 397; 2011 a. 23, 32, 45, 75; 2013 a. 165; 2015 a. 117, 118, 261; 2017 a. 369; 2023 a. 126; 2025 a. 7 s. 2.; s. 35.17 correction in (4v) (a). Municipal clerks are the officials primarily responsible for election administration in Wisconsin. A “board of election commissioners” is established in Wisconsin’s high population cities and counties to carry out the duties otherwise accomplished by municipal and county clerks everywhere else. The phrase “municipal clerk or board of election commissioners” appears in tandem all over the election statutes because that describes the duties of local election officials. State ex rel. Zignego v. Wisconsin Elections Commission, 2021 WI 32, 396 Wis. 2d 391, 957 N.W.2d 208, 19-2397. The “office” of a clerk and a “municipal clerk” are distinct terms. In elections statutes, when “office” is used in conjunction with a reference to the clerk, such “office” is specified as a place where a delivery or an action takes place. The “municipal clerk” is a person, while the “office of the municipal clerk” is a location. Priorities USA v. Wisconsin Elections Commission, 2024 WI 32, 412 Wis. 2d 594, 8 N.W.3d 429, 24-0164. Photographic identification is necessary for in-person voting. Students may use college-issued credentials under sub. (6m) (f), but only before an ID’s expiration date. There’s nothing wrong with a requirement that IDs be current. Luft v. Evers, 963 F.3d 665 (2020). Treating students differently from other potential voters without a rational basis violates the equal protection clause. Under sub. (6m) (f), a student identification card, alone among the sorts of photo ID that Wisconsin accepts, is not sufficient for voting unless the student also shows proof of current enrollment. No other category of acceptable identification depends on ongoing affiliation of any sort. That differential treatment violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Luft v. Evers, 963 F.3d 665 (2020). The requirements in sub. (6m) (f) that a student identification card must display: 1) an issuance date; 2) an expiration date; 3) an expiration date not more than two years after the issuance date; and 4) a signature, are rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and do not violate the equal protection clause. Common Cause v. Thomsen, 574 F. Supp. 3d 634 (2021).",

      "text": "5.90 Recounts. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, recounts of votes cast on an electronic voting system shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in s. 9.01. Except as provided in this subsection, sub. (2), and s. 9.01 (1) (b) 8s., if the ballots are distributed to the electors, the board of canvassers shall recount the ballots with automatic tabulating equipment. The board of canvassers shall test the automatic tabulating equipment to be used prior to the recount as provided in s. 5.84, and then the official ballots or the record of the votes cast shall be recounted on the automatic tabulating equipment. In addition, the board of canvassers shall check the ballots for the presence or absence of the initials and other distinguishing marks, shall examine the ballots marked “Rejected”, “Defective”, “Overvoted”, and “Objected to” to determine the propriety of such labels, and shall compare the “Duplicate Overvoted Ballots” and “Duplicate Damaged Ballots” with their respective originals to determine the correctness of the duplicates. Unless a court orders a recount to be conducted by another method under sub. (2), the board of canvassers may determine to conduct the recount of a specific election by hand and may determine to conduct the recount by hand for only certain wards or election districts. If electronic voting machines are used, the board of canvassers shall perform the recount using the permanent paper record of the votes cast by each elector, as generated by the machines. (2) Any candidate, or any elector when for a referendum, may, by the close of business on the next business day after the last day for filing a petition for a recount under s. 9.01, petition the circuit court for an order requiring ballots under sub. (1) to be counted by hand or by another method approved by the court. The petitioner in such an action bears the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that due to an irregularity, defect, or mistake committed during the voting or canvassing process the results of a recount using automatic tabulating equipment will produce incorrect recount results and that there is a substantial probability that recounting the ballots by hand or another method will produce a more correct result and change the outcome of the election. (3) A court with whom a petition under sub. (2) is filed shall hear the matter as expeditiously as possible, without a jury. The court may order a recount of the ballots by hand or another method only if it determines that the petitioner has established by clear and convincing evidence that due to an irregularity, defect, or mistake committed during the voting or canvassing process the results of a recount using automatic tabulating equipment will produce incorrect recount results and that there is a substantial probability that recounting the ballots by hand or another method will produce a more correct result and change the outcome of the election. Nothing in this section affects the right of a candidate or elector aggrieved by the recount to appeal to circuit court under s. 9.01 (6) upon completion of the recount.
