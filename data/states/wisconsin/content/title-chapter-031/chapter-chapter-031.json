      "text": "31.06 Hearing. (1) Upon receipt of an application for a permit under s. 31.05 the department may order a hearing or it may mail a notice that it will proceed on the application without public hearing unless a request for a public hearing is filed as provided in this section. The notice shall be mailed to the clerk of each municipality directly affected by the proposed dam. The department may give further or other notice as it considers proper. The department shall mail a copy of the notice to the applicant who shall cause the notice to be published in each county in which affected riparian lands are located as a class 1 notice, under ch. 985. If a hearing is not requested in writing within 30 days after mailing of the notice, the department may waive the hearing. (2) (a) If a hearing is ordered, the department shall, not less than 10 days before such hearing, mail written notice thereof to each person notified under sub. (1). (b) The department shall require the applicant to publish a class 1 notice under ch. 985, of the hearing in each county in which affected riparian lands are located, and may require the applicant to mail such other notices as it deems necessary. Proof of publication and proof of mailing under this subsection and sub. (1) shall be filed with the department. (3) (a) At a hearing under this section, or any adjournment of the hearing, the department shall consider the application and take evidence offered by the applicant and other persons supporting or opposing the proposed dam. The department may require the amendment of the application. (b) If it appears that the construction, operation or maintenance of the proposed dam is in the public interest, considering ecological, aesthetic, economic and recreational values, the department shall so find and grant a permit to the applicant, provided the department also finds that the applicant has complied with s. 31.14 (2) or (3) and, where applicable, with s. 31.05 (3), based on the department’s own estimate of the area of the flowage. (c) 1. The enjoyment of natural scenic beauty and environmental quality are declared to be public rights to be considered along with other public rights and the economic need of electric power for the full development of agricultural and industrial activity and other useful purposes in the area to be served. In considering public rights to the recreational use and natural scenic beauty of the river, the department shall investigate the potentialities of the lake and lakeshore created by the flowage and shall weigh the recreational use and scenic beauty of the lake and lakeshore against the known recreational use and scenic beauty of the river in its natural state. The department shall further weigh the known recreational use and scenic beauty of the particular section of river involved against the known recreational use and scenic beauty of other sections of the same river and other rivers in the area remaining in their natural state without regard to plans of other dams subsequently filed or to be filed. 2. The department shall deny the permit if it finds any of the following: a. It appears that the river in its natural state offers greater recreational facilities and scenic value for a larger number of people than can by proper control of the flowage level be obtained from the use of the lake and lakeshore and that the remaining sections of the river and other rivers in the area in their natural state provide an insufficient amount of recreational facilities and scenic beauty, and it further appears that the economic need of electric power is less than the value of the recreational and scenic beauty advantages of the river in its natural state. b. The permit will cause environmental pollution, as defined in s. 299.01 (4). (4) Not more than 20 days after receiving notice as provided in sub. (1) each county clerk may and upon request of the chairperson of the county board shall give written notice as provided in s. 59.11 (2) of a special meeting of the county board to be held at a time and place set by the county clerk, not less than 2 weeks nor more than 3 weeks after mailing of such notice, for the purpose of making findings as hereinafter provided. The county clerk shall give notice of the time, place and purpose of such special meeting to the department and to the applicant, who shall cause the same to be published in the county, as a class 2 notice, under ch. 985, and the applicant shall cause a copy thereof to be mailed at least 7 days prior to such special meeting to every person interested in any lands that will be affected by the proposed dam and whose post-office address can by due diligence be ascertained. Proof of such publication and notice shall be filed with the county clerk. At such special meeting the county board shall hear evidence offered by the applicant and other persons and shall find and determine by a majority vote of the county board members-elect whether the lake and lake shore created by the flowage or the river in its natural state offers greater recreational facilities and scenic beauty value for the larger number of people. The county clerk shall forthwith certify such finding and determination to the department. The jurisdiction and findings of each county board shall apply to that part of the proposed dam and flowage which is within the county. (5) If a hearing on the application for a permit is conducted as a part of a hearing under s. 293.43, the notice and hearing provisions in that section supersede the notice and hearing provisions of this section.
