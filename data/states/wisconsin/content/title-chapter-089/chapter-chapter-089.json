(1) Except as provided under ss. 89.072 and 89.073, veterinary licenses shall be issued only to persons who successfully pass an examination conducted by the examining board and pay the fee established under s. 89.063. An applicant for an initial license shall be a graduate of a veterinary college that has been approved by the examining board or have successfully completed either the educational commission for foreign veterinary graduates certification program of the American Veterinary Medical Association or the program for the assessment of veterinary education equivalence offered by the American Association of Veterinary State Boards.

In case of failure at any examination, the applicant shall have the privilege of taking subsequent examinations, upon the payment of another fee for each examination. (2m) (a) Upon application, the examining board may issue a veterinary faculty license to an employee of a school of veterinary medicine in this state who has received the degree of doctor of veterinary medicine from a veterinary college approved by the examining board or if the examining board determines that the person possesses substantially equivalent qualifications.

(b) Upon application, the examining board may grant a veterinary postgraduate training permit to a person undertaking intern or resident training at a school of veterinary medicine in this state. The only purpose of the veterinary postgraduate training permit is to provide opportunities in this state for the postgraduate education of persons who have received the degree of doctor of veterinary medicine or an equivalent degree but who have not yet met the requirements for licensure in this state. Issuance of a postgraduate training permit does not modify in any respect the requirements for licensure to practice veterinary medicine in this state, and a permit holder may practice veterinary medicine on privately owned animals only within the scope of the permit holder’s internship or residency program. Violation of this restriction or of any applicable provision of this chapter constitutes cause for revocation of the permit. (c) A license issued under this subsection expires upon termination of the licensee’s employment at a school of veterinary medicine in this state. A postgraduate training permit expires upon termination of the permit holder’s internship or residency program. (3) A veterinary technician certification may be issued only to a person who is at least 18 years of age and has either: (a) Successfully completed a 4-semester course of study in animal technology or its equivalent, at a technical school or college approved by the examining board, and has passed an examination, administered by the examining board, which establishes that the applicant’s knowledge of animals and their treatment is sufficient to qualify the applicant as a veterinary technician; or (b) Been an employee of a veterinarian for a total of 2 years and has passed an examination, administered by the examining board, which establishes that the applicant’s knowledge of animals and their treatment is sufficient to qualify the applicant as a veterinary technician. The 2-year employment requirement of this paragraph shall include at least 50 percent of the applicant’s time spent in practical field experience and the remainder of the applicant’s time spent in laboratory work, office procedure, and technical veterinary training with a veterinarian.
