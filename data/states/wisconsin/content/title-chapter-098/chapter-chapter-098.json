(2), a municipality having a population of more than 5,000, according to the most recent population estimate made by the department of administration under s. 16.96, shall enforce the provisions of this chapter within its jurisdiction. For this purpose, a municipality shall establish a municipal department of weights and measures. Each municipal department of weights and measures shall have such number of qualified sealers or inspectors as will ensure compliance with this chapter. Municipal sealers or inspectors shall have the same authority as sealers or inspectors of the department of agriculture, trade and consumer protection. The selection of municipal sealers or inspectors shall be from a list of applicants whose qualifications have been certified by the state or local civil service agency under the rules of the agency. The municipality shall procure and keep at all times a complete set of standards of weight and measure conforming to the state standards and shall submit the standards for certification at regular intervals as required by the department of agriculture, trade and consumer protection. The municipality shall keep a complete record of its work and annually shall file a report thereof with the department of agriculture, trade and consumer protection. The municipality may enact ordinances that regulate weights and measures and that are not in conflict with this chapter or the rules of the department of agriculture, trade and consumer protection. The municipality may assess fees that do not exceed the actual cost of its weights and measures program. (2) A municipality that is required to establish a department of weights and measures under sub. (1) may contract with the department of agriculture, trade, and consumer protection to enforce the provisions of this chapter within the municipality’s jurisdiction instead of establishing its own department if the department of agriculture, trade and consumer protection agrees to enter into such a contract. The department of agriculture, trade and consumer protection may charge the municipality fees sufficient to cover the department’s costs under the contract. A municipality may recover an amount not to exceed the cost of these fees by assessing fees on the persons who receive services under the weights and measures program.
