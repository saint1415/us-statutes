History: 1981 c. 79 s. 18; 1983 a. 189; 1993 a. 482; 1997 a. 27, 136; 2007 a. 20; 2009 a. 177; 2011 a. 32; 2015 a. 55, 216; 2023 a. 73. The definition of “rectifier” under sub.

This section by all appearances is a list of complete, and not delayed, exclusions. Arty’s, LLC v. DOR, 2018 WI App 64, 384 Wis. 2d 320, 919 N.W.2d 590, 17-0886. The plaintiff in this case bought various distilled spirits in bulk from a distillery and mixed the distilled spirits with soda, water, and various flavorings to produce bottles of premixed cocktails that the plaintiff sold to liquor wholesalers, who sold them to retailers. In this case, the first taxable sales of intoxicating liquors under s. 139.06 (1) (b) were sales by the plaintiff of its bottled mixtures to the plaintiff’s wholesaler customers. Sub. (4) excludes from consideration all transactions between the plaintiff and its distiller. Arty’s, LLC v. DOR, 2018 WI App 64, 384 Wis. 2d 320, 919 N.W.2d 590, 17-0886.",

No person may aid, abet or assist another in making any false or fraudulent return or false statement in any return required by this subchapter, with intent to defraud the state or evade payment of the tax, or any part thereof, imposed by this subchapter.
