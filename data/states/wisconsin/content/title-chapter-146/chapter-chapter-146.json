Sections 146.815, 146.82, 146.83 (4) and 146.835 apply to all patient health care records, including those on which written, drawn, printed, spoken, visual, electromagnetic or digital information is recorded or preserved, regardless of physical form or characteristics. History: 1999 a. 78. This section does not serve as an omnibus statute, intending to supersede in scope all statutes that reference health care records. Rather, the four enumerated statutes cover matters of content and confidentiality, and there is nothing in the text to indicate that its circumference is intended to expand beyond that narrow field. It neither limits the scope of s. 146.83 (3f) (a) nor is it rendered superfluous by the definition of “patient health care records” in s. 146.81 (4). Banuelos v.
