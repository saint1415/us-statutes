      "text": "138.10 Pawnbrokers. (1) Definitions. In this section: (a) “Pawnbroker” includes any person who engages in the business of lending money on the deposit or pledge of personal property, other than choses in action, securities, or written evidences of indebtedness; or purchases personal property with an expressed or implied agreement or understanding to sell it back at a subsequent time at a stipulated price. (b) “Pawnbroking” means the business of a pawnbroker as defined in this section. (c) “Pawn ticket” means the card, book, receipt or other record furnished to the pledgor at the time a loan is granted containing the terms of the contract for a loan. (d) “Person” includes an individual, partnership, association, business corporation, nonprofit corporation, common law trust, joint-stock company or any group of individuals however organized. (e) “Pledge” means an article or articles deposited with a pawnbroker as security for a loan in the course of the pawnbroker’s business as defined in par. (a). (f) “Pledgor” means the person who obtains a loan from a pawnbroker and delivers a pledge into the possession of a pawnbroker, unless the person discloses that he or she is or was acting for another in which case a “pledgor” means the disclosed principal. (2) Maximum loan. A pawnbroker’s loan may not exceed $150. (2m) Pawnbroking by licensed lenders. The division of banking may promulgate rules regulating the conduct of pawnbroking by persons licensed under s. 138.09 or 138.14. (4) Maximum interest or charges. A pawnbroker shall not charge, contract for or receive interest in excess of 3 percent per month on any loan or balance thereon and such interest shall not be increased by charging commission, discount, storage or other charge directly or indirectly, nor by compound interest; provided, however, that when the interest herein specified amounts to less than $1 per month, the minimum charge shall be $1 for the first month and 50 cents for each succeeding month during the loan period. (4m) When limit on maximum interest does not apply. Subsection (4) does not apply to a pawnbroker’s loan made after October 31, 1984 and before November 1, 1987. (5) Computation of interest or charges. The interest and charges authorized by this section shall be computed at the rates specified on the actual principal balance of the loan due for the actual time which has elapsed from the date of the loan to the date of payment. For the purpose of calculation of interest and charges permitted under this section, a year shall be 12 calendar months, and a month shall be one calendar month, or any fractional part thereof. A calendar month shall be any period from a certain date in one month to the same date in the next succeeding month. (8) Sale of pledge. Upon default in the payment of any loan, a pawnbroker may sell the pledge upon the conditions contained in this section. (a) A pawnbroker may sell a pledge at private sale for an amount not less than that agreed to by the pledgor, which amount shall be stipulated on the pawn ticket and shall not be less than 125 percent of the amount of the loan. A pledge which cannot be sold at private sale at the minimum price agreed to by the pledgor must be sold at public auction, which sale shall be conducted in the manner provided by s. 779.48 (1). (b) No unredeemed pledge may be sold before the expiration of 90 days after the due date of the loan unless otherwise specifically authorized in writing by the pledgor. The authority to sell an unredeemed pledge prior to the expiration of 90 days after the due date of the loan must be given by the pledgor on a date subsequent to the due date of the loan. (c) An unredeemed pledge must be sold within 12 months of the due date of a loan. No interest or charges permitted under this section may be collected on a loan after the expiration of 12 months of the due date of a loan, whether the loan is renewed or the loan is paid and the pledge redeemed. (9) Notice of sale. A pawnbroker shall not sell any pledge unless due notice of such contemplated sale has been sent to the pledgor, by registered mail or other means authorized by rule of the division of banking, to the address most recently given by the pledgor, as shown in the pawnbroker’s records. Notice of the contemplated sale of a pledge shall be sent to the pledgor not less than 30 days prior to the date of sale.

The surplus, if any, shall be paid to the pledgor or such other person who would have been entitled to redeem the pledge had it not been sold. (11) Notice of surplus. Notice of any surplus from the sale of a pledge shall be sent to the pledgor within 10 days of the date of sale. This notice may be sent by any means authorized for a notice of sale under sub. (9). (12) Reversion of surplus. If a surplus remaining from the sale of a pledge is not paid or claimed within one year from the date of sale, such surplus shall revert to the pawnbroker. The pawnbroker shall not be required to pay any interest on an unpaid surplus. (13) Forfeiture. A pawnbroker who charges, contracts for or receives interest or charges greater than permitted under this section shall forfeit both principal and interest, and shall return the pledge upon demand of the pledgor and surrender of the pawn ticket, without tender or payment of principal or interest. (14) Penalty. Any pawnbroker who refuses to comply with sub. (13) shall be imprisoned in the county jail for not more than one year or fined not more than $500. (15) Exception.
