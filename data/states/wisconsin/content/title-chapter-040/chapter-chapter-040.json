(6), all the employees of any employer shall be included under OASDHI through adoption of a resolution by the governing body of the employer providing for the coverage and stating the effective date of coverage. All groups covered by OASDHI, under s. 40.41, 1979 stats., prior to January 1, 1982, shall continue to be covered by OASDHI. Whenever any employer is created, the territory of which includes more than one-half of the last assessed valuation of an employer which prior to creation of the new employer had adopted a resolution under this subsection, and the employer so created assumes the functions and responsibilities of the previous employer with respect to the territory, then the employees of the employer so created shall be covered from the inception of the created employer as if a resolution had been adopted under this subsection. (2) The resolution provided for in sub. (1) may specify a coverage group comprised of persons under a retirement system which is eligible under federal regulations for inclusion under the state-federal OASDHI agreement, in which case a referendum in conformity with section 218 (d) (3) of the federal social security act shall be conducted. The governor may take any and all actions which may be required in connection with such a referendum. The agreement with the secretary of health and human services may be modified to cover the coverage group. (3) No agreement with the federal department of health and human services may be executed for the purpose of permitting one or more individuals to transfer by individual choice from that part of a retirement system which is composed of positions of employees who do not desire coverage under OASDHI to that part of a retirement system which is composed of positions of employees who desire OASDHI coverage. (4) Except as provided in sub. (6), all state employees, all teachers, the participating employees of all participating employers under the Wisconsin retirement system and all employees who would have become a participating employee of a participating employer except for the requirement of s. 40.22 (6) shall be included under OASDHI, notwithstanding sub. (1). (5) Except as provided in sub. (6), employees under any retirement system included in whole or in part under OASDHI, prior to January 1, 1982, under a referendum or a choice held in conformity with section 218 (d) (3) or 218 (d) (6) of the federal social security act, shall continue to be included under OASDHI in accordance with the results of the referendum or choice, notwithstanding sub. (1). (6) The following services shall be excluded from OASDHI coverage, and subsequent modifications of the state-federal agreement shall continue to provide for their exclusion: (a) Services performed by persons or in positions not eligible for inclusion under federal regulations. Any exclusion under this paragraph shall not continue if federal regulations are subsequently modified to include the services. (b) Services performed by a member of a board or commission, except members of governing bodies, in a position or office which does not normally require actual performance of duty for at least 600 hours in each calendar year. For purposes of this paragraph, a “board” or “commission” is a body referred to in the statutes as a board or commission. (c) Service performed in the employ of a school, college or university, if the service is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at the school, college or university. (d) Services of an employee whose participating employment in a position covered by a specific retirement system is not covered by OASDHI by reason of eligibility for a choice provided by statute prior to January 1, 1982, but only with respect to services in a position covered by that retirement system. (e) Services in police and fire fighter positions under a retirement system except: 1. If the services were covered under the federal OASDHI system under this section prior to the effective date of the retirement system coverage. 2. If the services have been covered under the federal OASDHI system under section 218 (m) of the federal social security act. (f) Services in a position eligible for participation in the Wisconsin retirement system only by virtue of s. 40.22 (2m). This exclusion does not apply to any employee who is a teacher, who is a participating employee in the Wisconsin retirement system or whose employer has adopted a resolution under sub. (1).

Unless the department receives the beneficiary’s written request to cancel the waiver before the date on which it would otherwise become effective, the waiver shall be effective 30 days after it is received by the department or the date specified in the waiver, if earlier. The waiver may be cancelled by the beneficiary in writing before the effective date. A waiver received after the effective date on which a beneficiary has commenced a monthly annuity under s. 40.73 (2) or (3) shall apply to monthly payments payable after the effective date of the waiver. Payment shall be subject to the restrictions specified in s. 40.73 (2) (b). (4) If a participant, employee or annuitant fully terminates all coverage and closes all accounts to which a written beneficiary designation applies, the designation does not apply if the individual again becomes a participant, employee or annuitant. (5) A designation of a testamentary trust as beneficiary shall satisfy the requirement of s. 40.02 (8) (a) 1. that a person or trust be specifically named in a written designation of beneficiary whether the will establishing the trust is written before or after the designation of beneficiary is received by the department. If, however, a designation specified the date or otherwise identified a specific will, the designation shall not apply if the will is not the last will and testament of the participant, employee or annuitant. (6) Any potential primary beneficiary under s. 40.02 (8) who cannot be located by reasonable efforts within 12 months after the later of the date of death of the participant or the date on which the department determines the person, trust, or estate initially became a potential primary beneficiary may be treated as a beneficiary that predeceased the participant and all other potential beneficiaries. (7) A trust that does not exist on the date of the participant’s death or an estate not opened or reopened within 12 months after the department determines the estate initially became a potential primary beneficiary under s. 40.02 (8) may be treated as a beneficiary that predeceased the participant and all other potential beneficiaries.
