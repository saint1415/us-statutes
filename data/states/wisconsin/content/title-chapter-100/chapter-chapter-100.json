(1) Any person who violates any provision of this chapter, except s. 100.18, 100.20, 100.206 or 100.51, for which no specific penalty is prescribed shall be fined not to exceed $200, or imprisoned in the county jail not more than 6 months or both. (2) Any person violating s. 100.02 is guilty of a Class I felony. (3) Any person who violates s. 100.15 or 100.19, or who intentionally refuses, neglects or fails to obey any regulation or order made or issued under s. 100.19 or 100.20, shall, for each offense, be fined not less than $25 nor more than $5,000, or imprisoned in the county jail for not more than one year or both. (4) Any person who violates s. 100.18 (1) to (8) or (10) or 100.182 is subject to a civil forfeiture of not less than $50 nor more than $200 for each violation. (4m) Any person who violates s. 100.18 (10r) is subject to a civil forfeiture of not less than $100 nor more than $10,000 for each violation. (5) Any person violating s. 100.18 (9) may be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than 9 months or both. Each day of violation constitutes a separate offense. (6) The department, the department of justice, after consulting with the department, or any district attorney may commence an action in the name of the state to recover a civil forfeiture to the state of not less than $100 nor more than $10,000 for each violation of an injunction issued under s. 100.18, 100.182 or 100.20 (6). The department of agriculture, trade and consumer protection or any district attorney may commence an action in the name of the state to recover a civil forfeiture to the state of not less than $100 nor more than $10,000 for each violation of an order issued under s. 100.20. (7) Any person violating s. 100.182 may be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than 9 months or both for each offense. Each unlawful advertisement published, printed or mailed on separate days or in separate publications, hand bills or direct mailings is a separate violation of this section. (8) Any person who violates s. 100.46 may be required to forfeit not more than $100. (9) Any person who violates s. 100.30 (7) (a) is subject to a forfeiture of not less than $50 nor more than $200 for each violation. History: 1975 c. 39; 1979 c. 327; 1981 c. 90; 1981 c. 124 s. 9; 1983 a. 500; 1985 a. 288; 1989 a. 31; 1993 a. 414; 1995 a. 27; 1997 a. 55, 111, 201, 253, 283; 1999 a. 32; 2001 a. 16, 109. It was constitutionally proper for the legislature to authorize in sub. (3) the imposition of criminal penalties for the violation of Department of Agriculture rules adopted pursuant to s. 100.20. State v. Lambert, 68 Wis. 2d 523, 229 N.W.2d 622 (1975). “Intentionally” in sub. (3) modifies only “refuses,” not “neglects or fails.” Multiplicitous charges must be avoided. State v. Stepniewski, 105 Wis. 2d 261, 314 N.W.2d 98 (1982). A reasonably prudent landlord would be able to understand, by reviewing the relevant statutes and administrative code provisions, that, upon withholding some or all of a tenant’s security deposit, the landlord may be held criminally liable for failing to provide a tenant with a statement of withholdings. A landlord has sufficient notice that failure to comply with the requirements under s. ATCP 134.06 (4), Wis. Adm. Code, could result in a violation of s. 100.20 as an unfair business or trade practice and, therefore, could be criminally prosecuted under sub. (3). The statutory scheme is not void for vagueness and comports with due process in this regard. State v. Lasecki, 2020 WI App 36, 392 Wis. 2d 807, 946 N.W.2d 137, 18-2340. A conviction under sub. (3) without proof of criminal intent did not violate the due process clause. Stepniewski v. Gagnon, 732 F.2d 567 (1984).",
