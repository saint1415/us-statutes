Every officer, agent or stockholder of a corporation, every manager or member of a limited liability company and every person to whom it shall be alleged that any transfer of property has been made, or in whose possession or control the property is alleged to be, may be compelled to testify in relation to the property and to the transfer or possession of the property; but the witness shall not be liable to criminal prosecution or proceeding for or on account of his or her testimony. (2) The immunity provided under sub. (1) is subject to the restrictions under s. 972.085. History: 1989 a. 122; 1993 a. 112; 1997 a. 253. A debtor who is compelled to answer an interrogatory may be granted immunity without a request from the district attorney.

(1) Claims which for want of record or for other reasons would not have been valid liens as against creditors of the debtor armed with process, pursuant to which such property has been attached or levied upon, shall not be liens against the estate. (2) Whenever a creditor is prevented from enforcing his or her rights as against a lien created or attempted to be created by his or her debtor, the receiver or assignee shall be subrogated to and may enforce such rights of such creditors for the benefit of the estate. (3) (a) In this subsection, “preference” has the meaning given in s. 128.07 (1) (a). (b) A lien created by, or obtained in or pursuant to any action that was begun against, a person within 4 months before the commencement of proceedings for the appointment of a receiver or the filing of an assignment under this chapter shall be dissolved by the appointment of a receiver or the qualification of the assignee, and the receiver or assignee shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the lien for the benefit of all creditors, if: 1. It appears that said lien was obtained and permitted while the debtor was insolvent, and that its existence or enforcement will work a preference, or 3. That such lien was sought and permitted in fraud of the provisions of this chapter. (4) Liens given or accepted in good faith and for a present consideration which have been properly recorded or filed shall, to the extent of such present consideration only, not be affected by the provisions of this chapter. (5) All conveyances, transfers, assignments or encumbrances of a debtor’s property, or any part of a debtor’s property, made or given by the debtor within 4 months prior to the filing of a petition or assignment under this chapter with the intent and purpose on the debtor’s part to hinder, delay or defraud any of the debtor’s creditors shall be void as against the debtor’s creditors except as to purchasers in good faith and for a present fair consideration. (5g) All property which is the subject of a conveyance, transfer, assignment or encumbrance rendered null and void under sub. (5) shall, if the property is not exempt from execution, be and remain a part of the assets and estate of the debtor and shall pass to the debtor’s receiver or assignee, whose duty it shall be to recover and retain the same for the benefit of the creditors. (5m) All conveyances, transfers or encumbrances of a debtor’s property made by the debtor at any time within 4 months prior to the filing of a petition or assignment hereunder, and while insolvent, which are null and void as against creditors by the laws of this state, shall pass to the receiver or assignee and be by him or her recovered for the benefit of the creditors. (6) All levies, judgments, attachments or other liens obtained through legal proceedings against a person who is insolvent at any time within 4 months prior to the filing of a petition or assignment under this chapter are void in case a receiver is appointed or an assignee qualifies. The property affected by the levy, judgment, attachment or other lien shall be wholly discharged and released from the levy, judgment, attachment or lien, and shall pass to the receiver or assignee as a part of the estate of the debtor unless the court shall, on due notice, order that the right under the levy, judgment, attachment or lien shall be preserved for the benefit of the estate. In that case, the right under the levy, judgment, attachment or lien may pass to and shall be preserved by the receiver or assignee for the benefit of the estate.
