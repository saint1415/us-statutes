The department shall be reimbursed for any amounts so paid plus the applicable interest rate, where payment is collected from the borrower.\n\n(g) Under conditions specified in rules adopted by the department, the lender may request that a portion or all of the guaranteed percentage of the principal balance of the loan be converted to a participating share held by the department.\n\n(h) Should the lender deem that foreclosure proceedings are necessary to collect moneys due from the borrower, it shall so notify the department. Within thirty days of the notification, the department may elect to request an assignment of the loan on payment in full to the lender of the principal balance and interest due. Foreclosure proceedings shall be held in abeyance in the interim.\n\n(i) The lender may reduce the percentage of the principal balance guaranteed under this section at any time.[L 1998, c 104, §2]\n\nThe capital loan revolving fund referred to in subsection (a) is repealed.",
