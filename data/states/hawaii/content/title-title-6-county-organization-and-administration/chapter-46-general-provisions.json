The authority provided by this paragraph shall not be self-executing, but shall become fully effective within a county only upon the enactment or adoption by the county of appropriate and particular laws, ordinances, or rules defining \"public nuisances\" with respect to each county's respective circumstances. The counties shall provide the property owner with the opportunity to contest the summary action and to recover the owner's property;\n\n(13) Each county shall have the power to enact ordinances deemed necessary to protect health, life, and property, and to preserve the order and security of the county and its inhabitants on any subject or matter not inconsistent with, or tending to defeat, the intent of any state statute where the statute does not disclose an express or implied intent that the statute shall be exclusive or uniform throughout the State;\n\n(14) Each county shall have the power to:\n\n(A) Make and enforce within the limits of the county all necessary ordinances covering all:\n\n(i) Local police matters;\n\n(ii) Matters of sanitation;\n\n(iii) Matters of inspection of buildings;\n\n(iv) Matters of condemnation of unsafe structures, plumbing, sewers, dairies, milk, fish, and morgues;

and\n\n(D) The rendering of civic tribute to individuals who, by virtue of their accomplishments and community service, merit civic commendations, recognition, or remembrance;\n\n(19) Each county shall have the power to:\n\n(A) Construct, purchase, take on lease, lease, sublease, or in any other manner acquire, manage, maintain, or dispose of buildings for county purposes, sewers, sewer systems, pumping stations, waterworks, including reservoirs, wells, pipelines, and other conduits for distributing water to the public, lighting plants, and apparatus and appliances for lighting streets and public buildings, and manage, regulate, and control the same;\n\n(B) Regulate and control the location and quality of all appliances necessary to the furnishing of water, heat, light, power, telephone, and telecommunications service to the county;\n\n(C) Acquire, regulate, and control any and all appliances for the sprinkling and cleaning of the streets and the public ways, and for flushing the sewers;

and\n\n(G) For purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C):\n\n(i) \"Infiltration\" means groundwater, rainwater, and saltwater that enters the county sewer system through cracked, broken, or defective sewer laterals; and\n\n(ii) \"Inflow\" means non-sewage entering the county sewer system via inappropriate or illegal connections;\n\n(24) (A) Each county may impose civil fines, in addition to criminal penalties, for any violation of county ordinances or rules after reasonable notice and requests to correct or cease the violation have been made upon the violator. Any administratively imposed civil fine shall not be collected until after an opportunity for a hearing under chapter 91. Any appeal shall be filed within thirty days from the date of the final written decision. These proceedings shall not be a prerequisite for any civil fine or injunctive relief ordered by the circuit court;\n\n(B) Each county by ordinance may provide for the addition of any unpaid civil fines, ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction, to any taxes, fees, or charges, with the exception of fees or charges for water for residential use and sewer charges, collected by the county. Each county by ordinance may also provide for the addition of any unpaid administratively imposed civil fines, which remain due after all judicial review rights under section 91-14 are exhausted, to any taxes, fees, or charges, with the exception of water for residential use and sewer charges, collected by the county. The ordinance shall specify the administrative procedures for the addition of the unpaid civil fines to the eligible taxes, fees, or charges and may require hearings or other proceedings. After addition of the unpaid civil fines to the taxes, fees, or charges, the unpaid civil fines shall not become a part of any taxes, fees, or charges. The county by ordinance may condition the issuance or renewal of a license, approval, or permit for which a fee or charge is assessed, except for water for residential use and sewer charges, on payment of the unpaid civil fines. Upon recordation of a notice of unpaid civil fines in the bureau of conveyances, the amount of the civil fines, including any increase in the amount of the fine which the county may assess, shall constitute a lien upon all real property or rights to real property belonging to any person liable for the unpaid civil fines. The lien in favor of the county shall be subordinate to any lien in favor of any person recorded or registered prior to the recordation of the notice of unpaid civil fines and senior to any lien recorded or registered after the recordation of the notice. The lien shall continue until the unpaid civil fines are paid in full or until a certificate of release or partial release of the lien, prepared by the county at the owner's expense, is recorded. The notice of unpaid civil fines shall state the amount of the fine as of the date of the notice and maximum permissible daily increase of the fine. The county shall not be required to include a social security number, state general excise taxpayer identification number, or federal employer identification number on the notice. Recordation of the notice in the bureau of conveyances shall be deemed, at such time, for all purposes and without any further action, to procure a lien on land registered in land court under chapter 501. After the unpaid civil fines are added to the taxes, fees, or charges as specified by county ordinance, the unpaid civil fines shall be deemed immediately due, owing, and delinquent and may be collected in any lawful manner. The procedure for collection of unpaid civil fines authorized in this paragraph shall be in addition to any other procedures for collection available to the State and county by law or rules of the courts;\n\n(C) Each county may impose civil fines upon any person who places graffiti on any real or personal property owned, managed, or maintained by the county. The fine may be up to $1,000 or may be equal to the actual cost of having the damaged property repaired or replaced. The parent or guardian having custody of a minor who places graffiti on any real or personal property owned, managed, or maintained by the county shall be jointly and severally liable with the minor for any civil fines imposed hereunder. Any such fine may be administratively imposed after an opportunity for a hearing under chapter 91, but such a proceeding shall not be a prerequisite for any civil fine ordered by any court. As used in this subparagraph, \"graffiti\" means any unauthorized drawing, inscription, figure, or mark of any type intentionally created by paint, ink, chalk, dye, or similar substances;\n\n(D) At the completion of an appeal in which the county's enforcement action is affirmed and upon correction of the violation if requested by the violator, the case shall be reviewed by the county agency that imposed the civil fines to determine the appropriateness of the amount of the civil fines that accrued while the appeal proceedings were pending. In its review of the amount of the accrued fines, the county agency may consider:\n\n(i) The nature and egregiousness of the violation;\n\n(ii) The duration of the violation;\n\n(iii) The number of recurring and other similar violations;\n\n(iv) Any effort taken by the violator to correct the violation;\n\n(v) The degree of involvement in causing or continuing the violation;\n\n(vi) Reasons for any delay in the completion of the appeal; and\n\n(vii) Other extenuating circumstances.\n\nThe civil fine that is imposed by administrative order after this review is completed and the violation is corrected shall be subject to judicial review, notwithstanding any provisions for administrative review in county charters;\n\n(E) After completion of a review of the amount of accrued civil fine by the county agency that imposed the fine, the amount of the civil fine determined appropriate, including both the initial civil fine and any accrued daily civil fine, shall immediately become due and collectible following reasonable notice to the violator. If no review of the accrued civil fine is requested, the amount of the civil fine, not to exceed the total accrual of civil fine prior to correcting the violation, shall immediately become due and collectible following reasonable notice to the violator, at the completion of all appeal proceedings; and\n\n(F) If no county agency exists to conduct appeal proceedings for a particular civil fine action taken by the county, then one shall be established by ordinance before the county shall impose the civil fine;\n\n(25) Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any county mayor, by executive order, may exempt donors, provider agencies, homeless facilities, and any other program for the homeless under part XVII of chapter 346 from real property taxes, water and sewer development fees, rates collected for water supplied to consumers and for use of sewers, and any other county taxes, charges, or fees; provided that any county may enact ordinances to regulate and grant the exemptions granted by this paragraph;\n\n(26) Any county may establish a captive insurance company pursuant to article 19, chapter 431; and\n\n(27) Each county shall have the power to enact and enforce ordinances regulating towing operations.

Rev. 136 (2019).\n\nState Constitution's conservation clause may obligate counties to use their authority to conserve public-trust resources, but it does not permit counties to exercise power that the State has not granted them. Therefore, it is irrelevant whether county ordinance is beyond the county's police power under this section because it is impliedly preempted by state law. 842 F.3d 669 (2016).\n\nWhere county passed an ordinance regarding pesticide use, court found that the State's statutory scheme for pesticides was comprehensive. Specifically, as with the county ordinance, the State's statutory scheme addressed permissible areas of pesticide application and warnings regarding the application of restricted use pesticides. Generally, the Hawaii pesticides law and its implementing rules addressed the entire life cycle of pesticides, including research/experimentation, transportation, storage, sale, use, and disposal. 842 F.3d 669 (2016).\n\nWhile no statute or agency rule specifically mentioned genetically engineered (GE) crops, the State's statutory scheme for regulation of potentially harmful plants was comprehensive, where, among other things, it governed the importation, sale, and eradication of potentially harmful plants; and disclosed a clear inference that the legislature intended for the State's regulation of potentially harmful plants to be exclusive of supplemental local regulations. Thus, court found that county ordinance was unenforceable and impliedly preempted by state law. 842 F.3d 688 (2016).\n\nCounty ordinance banning genetically engineered organisms was preempted by state law, where the ordinance's ban covered the subject matter embraced within a comprehensive scheme of state statutes and regulations intended to be exclusive and uniform throughout the State. Also, the ordinance's civil fine provisions were unenforceable, exceeding the maximum fine authorized by the county charter. 111 F. Supp. 3d 1088 (2015).\n\nPreemption of a county ordinance by state law does not turn on whether the ordinance addresses local, rather than statewide concerns. 111 F. Supp. 3d 1088 (2015).\n\nPublic utilities commission's regulatory powers over public utilities preempted power of counties to regulate height of utility poles. 72 H. 285, 814 P.2d 398.\n\nCounties' general power of eminent domain as set out in paragraph (6) not limited by § §46-61, 46-62, and 101-2; when a municipal ordinance may be preempted pursuant to paragraph (13), discussed. 76 H. 46, 868 P.2d 1193.\n\nFinancial responsibility law was not preempted by chapter 294, part I (chapter 294 is predecessor to chapter 431, article 10C), where plaintiff's preemption theories were grounded in §70-105 (predecessor to §46-1.5(13)). 76 H. 209, 873 P.2d 88.\n\nWhere city ordinance did not require that funds generated by a \"convicted persons\" charge be used to defray the city's investigative and prosecutorial costs associated with the individual payor's case, leaving open the possibility that the charge could be used for general revenue raising purposes, ordinance was not a \"service fee\" under paragraph (8), but a tax, which the State did not empower the city to impose; thus ordinance was invalid. 89 H. 361, 973 P.2d 736.\n\nParagraph (16) does not prohibit the condominium lease-to-fee conversion mechanism prescribed by Revised Ordinances of Honolulu chapter 38 with respect to oceanfront property. 98 H. 233, 47 P.3d 348.\n\nAs the plain language of paragraph (24)(A) establishes that its notice requirements apply under circumstances in which a county seeks to impose civil fines, where defendant was charged with criminal offenses and was sentenced to criminal penalties relating to a dog owner who negligently fails to control a dangerous dog, this paragraph did not apply to defendant's case. 120 H. 486 (App.), 210 P.3d 9.\n\nPursuant to the statutory grant of authority under this section, the city had the power to enact and enforce Revised Ordinances of Honolulu §7-7.2, which makes it a crime for a dog owner to negligently fail to control a dangerous dog. 120 H. 486 (App.), 210 P.3d 9.\n\nWhere a Hawaii county ordinance made the enforcement of marijuana laws the lowest enforcement priority in the county, the ordinance conflicted with the Hawaii Penal Code and covered the same subject matter that the legislature intended to govern under chapter 329, and, therefore, was preempted. 132 H. 511 (App.), 323 P.3d 155 (2014).",

Zoning shall be one of the tools available to the county to put the general plan into effect in an orderly manner. Zoning in the counties of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai means the establishment of districts of such number, shape, and area, and the adoption of regulations for each district to carry out the purposes of this section. In establishing or regulating the districts, full consideration shall be given to all available data as to soil classification and physical use capabilities of the land to allow and encourage the most beneficial use of the land consonant with good zoning practices. The zoning power granted herein shall be exercised by ordinance which may relate to:\n\n(1) The areas within which agriculture, forestry, industry, trade, and business may be conducted;\n\n(2) The areas in which residential uses may be regulated or prohibited;\n\n(3) The areas bordering natural watercourses, channels, and streams, in which trades or industries, filling or dumping, erection of structures, and the location of buildings may be prohibited or restricted;\n\n(4) The areas in which particular uses may be subjected to special restrictions;\n\n(5) The location of buildings and structures designed for specific uses and designation of uses for which buildings and structures may not be used or altered;\n\n(6) The location, height, bulk, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures;\n\n(7) The location of roads, schools, and recreation areas;\n\n(8) Building setback lines and future street lines;\n\n(9) The density and distribution of population;\n\n(10) The percentage of a lot that may be occupied, size of yards, courts, and other open spaces;\n\n(11) Minimum and maximum lot sizes; and\n\n(12) Other regulations the boards or city council find necessary and proper to permit and encourage the orderly development of land resources within their jurisdictions.\n\nThe council of any county shall prescribe rules, regulations, and administrative procedures and provide personnel it finds necessary to enforce this section and any ordinance enacted in accordance with this section. The ordinances may be enforced by appropriate fines and penalties, civil or criminal, or by court order at the suit of the county or the owner or owners of real estate directly affected by the ordinances.\n\nAny civil fine or penalty provided by ordinance under this section may be imposed by the district court, or by the zoning agency after an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to chapter 91. The proceeding shall not be a prerequisite for any injunctive relief ordered by the circuit court.\n\nNothing in this section shall invalidate any zoning ordinance or regulation adopted by any county or other agency of government pursuant to the statutes in effect prior to July 1, 1957.\n\nThe powers granted herein shall be liberally construed in favor of the county exercising them, and in such a manner as to promote the orderly development of each county or city and county in accordance with a long-range, comprehensive general plan to ensure the greatest benefit for the State as a whole. This section shall not be construed to limit or repeal any powers of any county to achieve these ends through zoning and building regulations, except insofar as forest and water reserve zones are concerned and as provided in subsections (c) and (d).\n\nNeither this section nor any ordinance enacted pursuant to this section shall prohibit the continued lawful use of any building or premises for any trade, industrial, residential, agricultural, or other purpose for which the building or premises is used at the time this section or the ordinance takes effect; provided that a zoning ordinance may provide for elimination of nonconforming uses as the uses are discontinued, or for the amortization or phasing out of nonconforming uses or signs over a reasonable period of time in commercial, industrial, resort, and apartment zoned areas only. In no event shall such amortization or phasing out of nonconforming uses apply to any existing building or premises used for residential (single-family or duplex) or agricultural uses. Nothing in this section shall affect or impair the powers and duties of the director of transportation as set forth in chapter 262.\n\n(b) Any final order of a zoning agency established under this section may be appealed to the circuit court of the circuit in which the land in question is found. The appeal shall be in accordance with the Hawaii rules of civil procedure.\n\n(c) Each county may adopt reasonable standards to allow the construction of two single-family dwelling units on any lot where a residential dwelling unit is permitted.\n\n(d) Neither this section nor any other law, county ordinance, or rule shall prohibit group living in facilities with eight or fewer residents for purposes or functions that are licensed, certified, registered, or monitored by the State; provided that a resident manager or a resident supervisor and the resident manager's or resident supervisor's family shall not be included in this resident count. These group living facilities shall meet all applicable county requirements not inconsistent with the intent of this subsection, including but not limited to building height, setback, maximum lot coverage, parking, and floor area requirements.\n\n(e) Neither this section nor any other law, county ordinance, or rule shall prohibit the use of land for employee housing and community buildings in plantation community subdivisions as defined in section 205-4.5(a)(12); in addition, no zoning ordinance shall provide for the elimination, amortization, or phasing out of plantation community subdivisions as a nonconforming use.\n\n(f) Neither this section nor any other law, county ordinance, or rule shall prohibit the use of land for medical cannabis production centers or medical cannabis dispensaries established and licensed pursuant to chapter 329D; provided that the land is otherwise zoned for agriculture, manufacturing, or retail purposes.

Despite the county's argument that the letter was insufficient notice of an actual claim, although not technically filed with the county clerk, it provided notice to the appropriate county officials.

The special improvement may also benefit property outside the district. The special taxes assessed pursuant to this section shall be a lien upon the property assessed. The lien shall have priority over all other liens except the lien of general real property taxes and the lien of assessments levied under section 46-80.

The ordinance shall also provide that if a lease requires the lessee to pay the proposed special tax, the ordinance shall state that the affected owner may waive this requirement in writing and that the affected owner refrain from imposing upon any successor lessee the obligation to pay the special tax. The ordinance shall also provide that if the affected owner fails to waive the requirement that the lessee pay the proposed tax, then all the rights for notice, hearing, and protest contained in this paragraph shall inure to the benefit of the original lessee or any subsequent lessee;\n\n(4) Provide notice to buyers or lessees of the property who would be required to pay the special tax;\n\n(5) Fixing, levying, collecting, and enforcing the special taxes against the properties affected thereby (including penalties for delinquent payment and sales for default);\n\n(6) Making changes in the community facilities district, in the special taxes, or in the special improvements to be financed or provided;\n\n(7) The acquisition or construction of the special improvements;\n\n(8) The issuance of bonds to pay all or part of the cost of the special improvements (including costs of issuance, reserves, capitalized interest, credit enhancement, and any other related expenses);\n\n(9) Refunding bonds previously issued;\n\n(10) The establishment and handling of a separate special fund or funds to pay or secure such bonds or to pay for acquisition or construction of special improvements or any other related expenses; and\n\n(11) Other matters as the council shall determine to be necessary or proper.\n\nThe amount of special taxes may include amounts determined by the council to be necessary or reasonable to cover administration and collection of the assessments, administration of the bonds or of the program authorized by this section, replenishment of reserves, arbitrage rebate, and a reasonable financing fee.\n\n(d) Each issue of bonds shall be authorized by ordinance, separate from the foregoing procedural ordinance, and shall be in such amounts, denominations, forms, executed in such manner, payable at such place or places, at such time or times, at such interest rate or rates (either fixed or variable), with such maturity date or dates and terms of redemption, security (including pledge of proceeds, special taxes and liens therefor), credit enhancement, administration, investment of proceeds and special tax receipts, default, remedy, or other terms and conditions as the council deems necessary or convenient.

Rev. 121.\n\nAvoiding the Next Hokuli €˜a: The Debate over Hawai €˜i's Agricultural Subdivisions. 27 UH L. Rev. 441.\n\n§46-121 Findings and purpose.The legislature finds that with land use laws taking on refinements that make the development of land complex, time consuming, and requiring advance financial commitments, the development approval process involves the expenditure of considerable sums of money. Generally speaking, the larger the project contemplated, the greater the expenses and the more time involved in complying with the conditions precedent to filing for a building permit.\n\nThe lack of certainty in the development approval process can result in a waste of resources, escalate the cost of housing and other development to the consumer, and discourage investment in and commitment to comprehensive planning. Predictability would encourage maximum efficient utilization of resources at the least economic cost to the public.\n\nPublic benefits derived from development agreements may include, but are not limited to, affordable housing, design standards, and on-and off-site infrastructure and other improvements. Such benefits may be negotiated for in return for the vesting of development rights for a specific period.\n\nUnder appropriate circumstances, development agreements could strengthen the public planning process, encourage private and public participation in the comprehensive planning process, reduce the economic cost of development, allow for the orderly planning of public facilities and services and the allocation of cost. As an administrative act, development agreements will provide assurances to the applicant for a particular development project, that upon approval of the project, the applicant may proceed with the project in accordance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, resolutions, rules, and policies in existence at the time the development agreement is executed and that the project will not be restricted or prohibited by the county's subsequent enactment or adoption of laws, ordinances, resolutions, rules, or policies.\n\nDevelopment agreements will encourage the vesting of property rights by protecting such rights from the effect of subsequently enacted county legislation which may conflict with any term or provision of the development agreement or in any way hinder, restrict, or prevent the development of the project. Development agreements are intended to provide a reasonable certainty as to the lawful requirements that must be met in protecting vested property rights, while maintaining the authority and duty of government to enact and enforce laws which promote the public safety, health, and general welfare of the citizens of our State. The purpose of this part is to provide a means by which an individual may be assured at a specific point in time that having met or having agreed to meet all of the terms and conditions of the development agreement, the individual's rights to develop a property in a certain manner shall be vested.

The study shall be prepared by an engineer, architect, or other qualified professional and shall identify service standard levels, project public facility capital improvement needs, and differentiate between existing and future needs.\n\n(b) The data sources and methodology upon which needs assessments and impact fees are based shall be set forth in the needs assessment study.\n\n(c) The pro rata amount of each impact fee shall be based upon the development and actual capital cost of public facility expansion, or a reasonable estimate thereof, to be incurred.\n\n(d) An impact fee shall be substantially related to the needs arising from the development and shall not exceed a proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred in accommodating the development. The following seven factors shall be considered in determining a proportionate share of public facility capital improvement costs:\n\n(1) The level of public facility capital improvements required to appropriately serve a development, based on a needs assessment study that identifies:\n\n(A) Deficiencies in existing public facilities;\n\n(B) The means, other than impact fees, by which existing deficiencies will be eliminated within a reasonable period of time; and\n\n(C) Additional demands anticipated to be placed on specified public facilities by a development;\n\n(2) The availability of other funding for public facility capital improvements, including but not limited to user charges, taxes, bonds, intergovernmental transfers, and special taxation or assessments;\n\n(3) The cost of existing public facility capital improvements;\n\n(4) The methods by which existing public facility capital improvements were financed;\n\n(5) The extent to which a developer required to pay impact fees has contributed in the previous five years to the cost of existing public facility capital improvements and received no reasonable benefit therefrom, and any credits that may be due to a development because of such contributions;\n\n(6) The extent to which a developer required to pay impact fees over the next twenty years may reasonably be anticipated to contribute to the cost of existing public facility capital improvements through user fees, debt service payments, or other payments, and any credits that may accrue to a development because of future payments; and\n\n(7) The extent to which a developer is required to pay impact fees as a condition precedent to the development of non-site related public facility capital improvements, and any offsets payable to a developer because of this provision.\n\n(e) The impact fee ordinance shall contain a provision setting forth the process by which a developer may contest the amount of the impact fee assessed.

These areas, if preserved and maintained in their present state, would constitute important physical, social, aesthetic, or economic assets to existing or impending urban and metropolitan development. The legislature further finds that the transfer of development rights from lands vulnerable to or adversely affected by sea level rise, coastal erosion, storm surge, or flooding to lands that are not at risk from these hazards would reduce property losses and result in long-term economic and fiscal benefits to communities and government. The legislature also finds that transferring development rights is a useful technique to achieve community objectives. Properly utilized, the concept can be fully consistent with comprehensive planning requirements. The legislature further finds and declares that the concept, utilizing the normal market in land, can provide a mechanism of just compensation to owners of property to be protected or preserved.

All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.\n\n(d) Regardless of whether the county proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 46-171 upon which the action was brought, then the court, to the extent the court considers appropriate, may reduce the share of the proceeds of the action that the person would otherwise receive under subsection (a), taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from the person's role in the violation of section 46-171, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. The dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the county to continue the action.\n\n(e) If the county does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was frivolous, vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.\n\n(f) In no event may a person bring an action under section 46-175:\n\n(1) Against any elected official of the county, if the action is based on evidence or information known to the county. For purposes of this section, evidence or information known only to the person or persons against whom an action is brought shall not be considered to be known to the county; or\n\n(2) That is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the county is already a party.
