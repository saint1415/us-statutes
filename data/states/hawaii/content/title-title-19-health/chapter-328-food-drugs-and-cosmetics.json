and\n\n(B) Such adequate warnings against use in those pathological conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous to health, or against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the protection of users;

provided that the method of packaging may be modified with the consent of the director, or if consent is obtained under the Federal Act. Whenever a drug is recognized in both the United States Pharmacopoeia and the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, it shall be subject to the requirements of the United States Pharmacopoeia with respect to the packaging and labeling unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homeopathic drug, in which case it shall be subject to the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States and not to the United States Pharmacopoeia; provided that in the event of inconsistency between the requirements of this paragraph and those of paragraph (5) as to the name by which the drug or its ingredients shall be designated, the requirements of paragraph (5) shall prevail.\n\n(8) If it has been found by the director to be a drug liable to deterioration, unless it is packaged in such form and manner, and its label bears a statement of such precautions, as the rules adopted by the director or regulations issued under the Federal Act require as necessary for the protection of public health.
