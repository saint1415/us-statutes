      "text": "§343-1 Findings and purpose.The legislature finds that the quality of humanity's environment is critical to humanity's well being, that humanity's activities have broad and profound effects upon the interrelations of all components of the environment, and that an environmental review process will integrate the review of environmental concerns with existing planning processes of the State and counties and alert decision makers to significant environmental effects which may result from the implementation of certain actions. The legislature further finds that the process of reviewing environmental effects is desirable because environmental consciousness is enhanced, cooperation and coordination are encouraged, and public participation during the review process benefits all parties involved and society as a whole.\n\nIt is the purpose of this chapter to establish a system of environmental review which will ensure that environmental concerns are given appropriate consideration in decision making along with economic and technical considerations.

When a conflict of interest may exist because the proposing agency and the agency making the determination are the same, the office may review the agency's determination, consult the agency, and advise the agency of potential conflicts, to comply with this section. The office shall publish the final determination for the public's information pursuant to section 343-3.\n\nThe draft and final statements, if required, shall be prepared by the agency and submitted to the office. The draft statement shall be made available for public review and comment through the office for a period of forty-five days. The office shall inform the public of the availability of the draft statement for public review and comment pursuant to section 343-3. The agency shall respond in writing to comments received during the review and prepare a final statement.\n\nThe office, when requested by the agency, may make a recommendation as to the acceptability of the final statement.\n\n(d) The final authority to accept a final statement shall rest with:\n\n(1) The governor, or the governor's authorized representative, whenever an action proposes the use of state lands or the use of state funds, or whenever a state agency proposes an action within the categories in subsection (a); or\n\n(2) The mayor, or the mayor's authorized representative, of the respective county whenever an action proposes only the use of county lands or county funds.\n\nAcceptance of a required final statement shall be a condition precedent to implementation of the proposed action. Upon acceptance or nonacceptance of the final statement, the governor or mayor, or the governor's or mayor's authorized representative, shall file notice of such determination with the office. The office, in turn, shall publish the determination of acceptance or nonacceptance pursuant to section 343-3.\n\n(e) Whenever an applicant proposes an action specified by subsection (a) that requires approval of an agency and that is not a specific type of action declared exempt under section 343-6, the agency initially receiving and agreeing to process the request for approval shall require the applicant to prepare an environmental assessment of the proposed action at the earliest practicable time to determine whether an environmental impact statement shall be required; provided that if the agency determines, through its judgment and experience, that an environmental impact statement is likely to be required, the agency may authorize the applicant to choose not to prepare an environmental assessment and instead prepare an environmental impact statement that begins with the preparation of an environmental impact statement preparation notice as provided by rules. The final approving agency for the request for approval is not required to be the accepting authority.\n\nFor environmental assessments for which a finding of no significant impact is anticipated:\n\n(1) A draft environmental assessment shall be made available for public review and comment for a period of thirty days;\n\n(2) The office shall inform the public of the availability of the draft environmental assessment for public review and comment pursuant to section 343-3; and\n\n(3) The applicant shall respond in writing to comments received during the review and the applicant shall prepare a final environmental assessment to determine whether an environmental impact statement shall be required. A statement shall be required if the agency finds that the proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment. The agency shall file notice of the agency's determination with the office, which, in turn, shall publish the agency's determination for the public's information pursuant to section 343-3.\n\nThe draft and final statements, if required, shall be prepared by the applicant, who shall file these statements with the office.\n\nThe draft statement shall be made available for public review and comment through the office for a period of forty-five days. The office shall inform the public of the availability of the draft statement for public review and comment pursuant to section 343-3.\n\nThe applicant shall respond in writing to comments received during the review and prepare a final statement. The office, when requested by the applicant or agency, may make a recommendation as to the acceptability of the final statement.\n\nThe authority to accept a final statement shall rest with the agency initially receiving and agreeing to process the request for approval. The final decision-making body or approving agency for the request for approval is not required to be the accepting authority. The planning department for the county in which the proposed action will occur shall be a permissible accepting authority for the final statement.\n\nAcceptance of a required final statement shall be a condition precedent to approval of the request and commencement of the proposed action. Upon acceptance or nonacceptance of the final statement, the agency shall file notice of the determination with the office. The office, in turn, shall publish the determination of acceptance or nonacceptance of the final statement pursuant to section 343-3.\n\nThe agency receiving the request, within thirty days of receipt of the final statement, shall notify the applicant and the office of the acceptance or nonacceptance of the final statement. The final statement shall be deemed to be accepted if the agency fails to accept or not accept the final statement within thirty days after receipt of the final statement; provided that the thirty-day period may be extended at the request of the applicant for a period not to exceed fifteen days.\n\nIn any acceptance or nonacceptance, the agency shall provide the applicant with the specific findings and reasons for its determination.\n\n(f) Whenever an applicant requests approval for a proposed action and there is a question as to which of two or more state or county agencies with jurisdiction has the responsibility of determining whether an environmental assessment is required, the office, after consultation with and assistance from the affected state or county agencies, shall determine which agency has the responsibility for determining whether an environmental assessment by the applicant is required, except in situations involving secondary actions under section 343-5.5; provided that in no case shall the office be considered the approving agency.\n\n(g) In preparing an environmental assessment, an agency may consider and, where applicable and appropriate, incorporate by reference, in whole or in part, previous determinations of whether a statement is required and previously accepted statements. The council, by rule, shall establish criteria and procedures for the use of previous determinations and statements.\n\n(h) Whenever an action is subject to both the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-190) and the requirements of this chapter, the office and agencies shall cooperate with federal agencies to the fullest extent possible to reduce duplication between federal and state requirements. Such cooperation, to the fullest extent possible, shall include joint environmental impact statements with concurrent public review and processing at both levels of government. Where federal law has environmental impact statement requirements in addition to but not in conflict with this chapter, the office and agencies shall cooperate in fulfilling these requirements so that one document shall comply with all applicable laws.\n\n(i) A statement that is accepted with respect to a particular action shall satisfy the requirements of this chapter, and no other statement for the proposed action shall be required.

The office, any agency responsible for approval of the action, or the applicant shall be adjudged an aggrieved party for the purposes of bringing judicial action under this subsection.

Any judicial proceeding, the subject of which is the determination that a statement is not required for a proposed action, shall be initiated within thirty days after the public has been informed of such determination pursuant to section 343-3. The applicant shall be adjudged an aggrieved party for the purposes of bringing judicial action under this subsection. Others, by environmental court action, may be adjudged aggrieved.\n\n(c) Any judicial proceeding, the subject of which is the acceptance or nonacceptance of an environmental impact statement required under section 343-5, shall be initiated within sixty days after the public has been informed pursuant to section 343-3 of the acceptance or nonacceptance of such statement.

Rev. 581 (2011).\n\nPlaintiff's claims that Hawai`i environmental policy act was violated were barred; plaintiff did not submit comment and filed suit more than sixty days after office of environmental quality control informed the public that the state final environmental impact statement had been accepted. 307 F. Supp. 2d 1149 (2004).\n\nCourt has no jurisdiction over actions initiated after time limit. 64 H. 126, 637 P.2d 776 (1981).\n\nDate of commission's decision to grant SMA permit triggered time period for appeal, not date when commission made express determination that no environmental assessment was required for project; plaintiff's challenge to lack of environmental assessment thus timely. 86 H. 66, 947 P.2d 378 (1997).\n\nWhere the federal construct of a procedural right was not germane to case because this section, the statute at issue, establishes who and under what circumstances the lack of an environmental assessment, may be challenged, and federal cases recognizing this standard were inapposite because they rested on non-analogous statutes, petitioner could not be afforded so-called \"procedural standing\" under subsection (a). 100 H. 242, 59 P.3d 877 (2002).\n\nWhere Hawaiian homes commission did not accept the proposal for an environmental impact statement, the subject of the judicial proceeding before the trial court was not the \"acceptance\" of such statement; intervenors were not required to provide written comments pursuant to subsection (c) as subsection (c) did not apply; intervenor's objections, therefore, were subject to judicial review under subsection (b). 106 H. 270, 103 P.3d 939 (2005).\n\nAppellants established standing where they showed threatened injuries under the traditional injury-in-fact test and procedural injuries based on a procedural right test; the threatened injury in fact was due to defendant's decision to go forward with harbor improvements and allow the superferry project to operate at Kahului harbor without conducting an environmental assessment; the procedural injury was based on various interests appellants identified that were threatened due to the violation of their procedural rights under this chapter. 115 H. 299, 167 P.3d 292 (2007).\n\nWhere this section waived the State's sovereign immunity against actions brought to challenge: (1) the lack of an environmental assessment; (2) the determination that an environmental impact statement is or is not required; and (3) the acceptance of an environmental impact statement, sovereign immunity did not prevent the application of the private attorney general doctrine against the State and the circuit court did not err in relying on the doctrine as a basis for its award of attorney's fees against the State and superferry jointly. 120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226 (2009).\n\nAlthough the subdivision application was part of the larger action (i.e., the project), the specific \"action\" for statute of limitations purposes was the date the subdivision application was approved, as opposed to when the project itself was originally approved; thus, where plaintiffs' initial complaint was filed within 120 days of the department of planning and permitting's approval of the subdivision application, plaintiffs' claims were not barred by this section. 123 H. 150, 231 P.3d 423 (2010).\n\nWhere there was no evidence that the city department of planning and permitting filed a notice with the office of environmental quality control pursuant to HAR §11-200-11.1 of its determination that a supplemental environmental impact statement was not required, there was no date from which to measure the thirty day limitation prescribed by subsection (b) and subsection (b) was thus inapplicable; in addition, given the plain and unambiguous language of this section and §343-3, coupled with the related administrative rules, actual knowledge cannot be substituted for the public notice requirement. 123 H. 150, 231 P.3d 423 (2010).\n\nCited: 134 H. 86 (App.), 332 P.3d 688 (2014).",
