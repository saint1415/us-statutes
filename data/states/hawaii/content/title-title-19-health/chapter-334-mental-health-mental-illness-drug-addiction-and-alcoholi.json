To see the definition of \"law enforcement officer\" by L 2013, c 221, see the 2013 Session Laws of Hawaii.\n\nAttorney General Opinions\n\nRegarding the meaning and functioning of this chapter and the assisted community treatment provisions under part VIII: (1) to be deemed \"imminently dangerous to self or others\", the individual does not need to be currently dangerous to self or others; (2) determinations surrounding whether a person is \"dangerous to self\" or \"imminently dangerous to self or others\" are mixed questions of fact and law; (3) if an individual is not \"imminently dangerous to self or others\", the individual may be placed under an assisted community treatment order, if appropriate; and (4) an individual may be forcibly medicated under an assisted community treatment order if the individual is within an emergency department or admitted to a hospital, it is determined there that the individual is \"imminently dangerous to self or others\", and the administration of medication pursuant to the assisted community treatment order is indicated by good medical practice. Att. Gen. Op. 23-01.\n\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\nFor description of procedure under chapter, see Thou Shalt Not Commit. V HBJ, no. 2, at 46 (1968).\n\nIn light of the definition of \"dangerous to self\" under this section, person's refusal to take medications and person's racist remarks to strangers constituted insufficient evidence to support family court's finding that person was imminently and substantially dangerous to person's self. 102 H. 528 (App.), 78 P.3d 341 (2003).",

An emergency admission may be initiated as follows:\n\n(1) If a law enforcement officer has reason to believe that a person is imminently dangerous to self or others, the officer shall call for assistance from the mental health emergency workers designated by the director. Upon determination by the mental health emergency workers that the person is imminently dangerous to self or others, the person shall be transported by ambulance or other suitable means, to a licensed psychiatric facility for further evaluation and possible emergency hospitalization. A law enforcement officer may also take into custody and transport to any facility designated by the director any person threatening or attempting suicide. The officer shall make application for the examination, observation, and diagnosis of the person in custody. The application shall state or shall be accompanied by a statement of the circumstances under which the person was taken into custody and the reasons therefor which shall be transmitted with the person to a physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or psychologist at the facility.\n\n(2) Upon written or oral application of any licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse, psychologist, attorney, member of the clergy, health or social service professional, or any state or county employee in the course of employment, a judge may issue an ex parte order orally, but shall reduce the order to writing by the close of the next court day following the application, stating that there is probable cause to believe the person is mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse, is imminently dangerous to self or others and in need of care or treatment, or both, giving the findings upon which the conclusion is based. The order shall direct that a law enforcement officer or other suitable individual take the person into custody and deliver the person to a designated mental health program, if subject to an assisted community treatment order issued pursuant to part VIII of this chapter, or to the nearest facility designated by the director for emergency examination and treatment, or both. The ex parte order shall be made a part of the patient's clinical record. If the application is oral, the person making the application shall reduce the application to writing and shall submit the same by noon of the next court day to the judge who issued the oral ex parte order. The written application shall be executed subject to the penalties of perjury but need not be sworn to before a notary public.\n\n(3) Any licensed physician, advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, or psychologist who has examined a person and has reason to believe the person is:\n\n(A) Mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse;\n\n(B) Imminently dangerous to self or others; and\n\n(C) In need of care or treatment;\n\nmay direct transportation, by ambulance or other suitable means, to a licensed psychiatric facility for further evaluation and possible emergency hospitalization. A licensed physician, an advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant may administer treatment as is medically necessary, for the person's safe transportation. A licensed psychologist may administer treatment as is psychologically necessary.\n\n(b) Emergency examination. A patient who is delivered for emergency examination and treatment to a psychiatric facility or a behavioral health crisis center shall be provided an examination, which shall include a screening to determine whether the criteria for involuntary hospitalization listed in section 334-60.2 persists, by a licensed physician, medical resident under the supervision of a licensed physician, or advanced practice registered nurse without unnecessary delay, and shall be provided such treatment as is indicated by good medical practice. If, after the examination, screening, and treatment, the licensed physician, medical resident under the supervision of a licensed physician, or advanced practice registered nurse determines that the involuntary hospitalization criteria persist, then a psychiatrist or advanced practice registered nurse who has prescriptive authority and who holds an accredited national certification in an advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric specialization shall further examine the patient to diagnose the presence or absence of a mental illness or substance use disorder, further assess the risk that the patient may be dangerous to self or others, and assess whether or not the patient needs to be hospitalized. If it is determined that hospitalization is not needed, an examination pursuant to section 334-121.5 shall be completed.\n\n(c) Release from emergency examination. If, after examination, the licensed physician, psychiatrist, or advanced practice registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who holds an accredited national certification in an advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric specialization determines that the involuntary hospitalization criteria set forth in section 334-60.2 are not met or do not persist and the examination pursuant to section 334-121.5, where required, has been completed, the patient shall be discharged expediently, unless the patient is under criminal charges, in which case the patient shall be returned to the custody of a law enforcement officer.\n\n(d) Emergency hospitalization. If the psychiatrist or advanced practice registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who holds an accredited national certification in an advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric specialization who performs the emergency examination has reason to believe that the patient is:\n\n(1) Mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse;\n\n(2) Imminently dangerous to self or others; and\n\n(3) In need of care or treatment, or both;\n\nthe psychiatrist or advanced practice registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who holds an accredited national certification in an advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric specialization shall direct that the patient be hospitalized on an emergency basis or cause the patient to be transferred to another psychiatric facility for emergency hospitalization, or both. The patient shall have the right immediately upon admission to telephone the patient's guardian or a family member including a reciprocal beneficiary, or an adult friend and an attorney. If the patient declines to exercise that right, the staff of the facility shall inform the adult patient of the right to waive notification to the family, including a reciprocal beneficiary, and shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the patient's guardian or family, including a reciprocal beneficiary, is notified of the emergency admission but the patient's family, including a reciprocal beneficiary, need not be notified if the patient is an adult and requests that there be no notification. The patient shall be allowed to confer with an attorney in private.\n\n(e) Release from emergency hospitalization. If at any time during the period of emergency hospitalization the treating physician determines that the patient no longer meets the criteria for emergency hospitalization and the examination pursuant to section 334-121.5 has been completed, the physician shall expediently discharge the patient. If the patient is under criminal charges, the patient shall be returned to the custody of a law enforcement officer. In any event, the patient shall be released within forty-eight hours of the patient's admission to a psychiatric facility, unless the patient voluntarily agrees to further hospitalization, or a proceeding for court-ordered evaluation or hospitalization, or both, is initiated as provided in section 334-60.3. If that time expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the time for initiation is extended to the close of the next court day. Upon initiation of the proceedings, the facility shall be authorized to detain the patient until further order of the court.

If application for admission is countersigned by a minor aged fifteen through seventeen years before a family court officer, no hearing shall be necessary. If the minor elects not to sign, involuntary hospitalization proceedings shall be initiated.\n\n(c) A facility shall discharge a voluntary patient who has sufficiently improved so that hospitalization is no longer desirable. A voluntary patient or the patient's guardian, representative, or attorney may request discharge in writing at any time following admission to the facility. If discharge would be dangerous to the patient or others, proceedings for involuntary hospitalization must be initiated as soon as possible but within twenty-four hours of the receipt by the administrator of the written request for discharge. If that time expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the time for initiation is extended to the close of the next court day. Upon the initiation of the proceedings, the facility is authorized to detain the patient until further order of the court.

Applicants may apply for operation under the following program elements:\n\n(1) A short-term crisis residential alternative to hospitalization for individuals experiencing an acute episode or situational crisis.

The primary focus of this element shall be on reduction of the crisis, stabilization, diagnostic evaluation, and assessment of the person's existing support system, including recommendations for referrals upon discharge. This service in the program shall be designed for persons who would otherwise be referred to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit;\n\n(2) A long-term residential treatment program for clients who would otherwise be living marginally in the community with little or no service support, and who would return many times to the hospital for treatment. It also will serve those who are referred to, and maintained in, state facilities or nursing homes, or private or public facilities or programs under contract with the director pursuant to section 334-2.5, because they require long-term, intensive support. This service shall be designed to provide a rehabilitation program for the so-called \"chronic\" patient who needs long-term support in order to develop independent living skills. This program goes beyond maintenance to provide an active rehabilitation focus for these individuals;\n\n(3) A transitional residential program designed for persons who are able to take part in programs in the general community, but who, without the support of counseling as well as the therapeutic community, would be at risk of returning to the hospital or becoming homeless by reason of serious and persistent mental health challenges. These programs may employ a variety of staffing patterns and are for persons who are expected to move toward a more independent living setting. The clients shall be expected to play a major role in the functioning of the household and shall be encouraged to accept increasing levels of responsibility, both in the residential community and in the community as a whole. Residents are required to be involved in daytime activities outside of the facility that are relevant to their personal goals and conducive to their achieving more self-sufficiency; or\n\n(4) A semisupervised, independent, but structured living arrangement for persons who do not need the intensive support of the system elements of paragraph (1), (2), or (3), but who, without some support and structure, are at risk of requiring hospitalization or becoming homeless by reason of serious and persistent mental health challenges. The small cooperative housing units shall function as independent households with direct linkages to staff support in case of emergencies, as well as for regular assessment and evaluation meetings. Individuals may use satellite housing as a transition to independent living or may remain in this setting indefinitely in order to avoid the need for more intensive settings.
