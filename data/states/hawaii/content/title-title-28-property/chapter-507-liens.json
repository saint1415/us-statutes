It is necessary to allege and prove the contractual relation. 16 H. 23 (1904).\n\nAs §480-12 voided the contract between homeowner and contractor, §480-12 and this section precluded the imposition of a lien under this section upon the homeowner's property by contractor who failed to comply with the requirements of §444-25.5. 96 H. 365 (App.), 31 P.3d 222 (2001).\n\nConstruction.\n\nStatute strictly construed and all the provisions of the statute must be strictly complied with. 9 H. 23, 25 (1893); 10 H. 151, 159 (1895); 25 H. 214, 218 (1919). But remedial portions should be liberally construed. 22 H. 765 (1915); 24 H. 39, 43 (1917); 40 H. 325 (1953). See 38 H. 372 (1949).\n\nMaterialman who is surety on contractor's bond to owner not estopped to assert materialman's lien. 9 H. 364 (1894). Materialman's lien cannot be destroyed by provisions in contract between owner and contractor against liens of which he was not a party and had no notice. 20 H. 693 (1911). Materialman does not waive lien by charging items on materialman's books to subcontractor. 14 H. 448 (1902). Assignment to materialman by the contractor of all moneys payable under the contract, accepted by the owner \"subject to all the conditions of the contract,\" does not estop the materialman from enforcing lien. 10 H. 151 (1895).\n\nMaterialman who fails to warn homeowner of financial precariousness of contractor, when estopped. 56 H. 251, 535 P.2d 129 (1975).\n\nActual or visible improvements must exist before lien can attach. 62 H. 13, 608 P.2d 405 (1980).\n\nCited: 59 H. 612, 585 P.2d 1265 (1978).\n\nLiability of owner.\n\nNot personally liable in assumpsit upon implied promise of subcontractor or materialman for materials furnished the contractor. 16 H. 23 (1904). Payment, waiver. 32 H. 913 (1933).\n\nLiability of vendor.\n\nUpon breach of covenant to pay by vendee. 40 H. 325 (1953).\n\nCannot exist or be enforced against a structure separately from the interest of the owner in the land. 20 H. 180 (1910); 21 H. 585 (1913). Nor can it exist unless the improvement is authorized by the owner. 20 H. 693, 697-698 (1911).\n\nWhen State is vendor, second paragraph of section making interest of vendor subject to lien is not applicable. 51 H. 87, 451 P.2d 809 (1969).\n\nFact that project site is owned by government in fee simple does not make private leasehold interest thereon immune from lien. 52 H. 298, 475 P.2d 362 (1970).\n\nEnforcement by trustees of employee benefit trust fund upheld. 63 H. 566, 633 P.2d 1106 (1981).\n\nWhere plaintiff did not provide to homeowners the lien disclosure notices before or upon signing of the contract or prior to the commencement of the work as required by §444-25.5(a), plaintiff's conduct was an unfair or deceptive practice that rendered its contract void and unenforceable at law or in equity under §480-12; thus, plaintiff was not entitled to a lien upon homeowners' property under this section, and trial court did not err in dismissing its lien application. 111 H. 349, 141 P.3d 996 (2006).\n\nPreparers of architectural and engineering plans entitled to mechanic's lien to the extent of the value of their services which are incorporated into the final structure. 3 H. App. 58, 641 P.2d 337 (1982).\n\nLien accrues.\n\nIn favor of subcontractors and materialmen independently of the original contractor and not by way of subrogation to the rights of the latter. 10 H. 151, 153, 154 (1895); 20 H. 693, 695 (1911). A person furnishing materials to a subcontractor comes within the statute. 14 H. 448 (1902). Lien runs to any person furnishing labor or materials. 20 H. 693, 695 (1911). Except a mere trespasser. 16 H. 23 (1904); 20 H. 693, 697-698 (1911).\n\nNo lien for materials furnished for but not incorporated in the building. 10 H. 151 (1895). Cash advanced is neither labor nor materials. 14 H. 448 (1902). Proof that materials were ordered for and delivered to the building is prima facie evidence that they were put into the building. 10 H. 151, 158 (1895); 12 H. 356 (1900). Lien cannot be enforced for lienable items under entire contract which includes non-lienable items unless price severable. 16 H. 418, 425 (1905), rev'd on other grounds, 205 U.S. 340 (1907).\n\nIncludes a lessor whose lease requires the erection of buildings although the lessee contracted for the building. 22 H. 765 (1915); 24 H. 181, 188 (1918). Lessor and lessee both owners. 22 H. 765 (1915); 24 H. 181, 188 (1918). Lien attaches to equitable interests. 30 H. 882 (1929).\n\nWhere a lease requires the construction of improvements by a lessee, the lessor's interest in the property is subject to mechanic's and materialman's liens. 2 H. App. 339, 631 P.2d 1211 (1981).\n\nPreemption.\n\nERISA does not explicitly or implicitly preempt this section; section may thus be used by laborers' trust fund to collect delinquent trust fund contributions. 81 H. 487, 918 P.2d 1143 (1996).\n\n\"For the price agreed upon\", see 10 H. 151, 154-155 (1895). The amount for which the property may be charged with a lien in favor of a subcontractor or materialman is not limited to the amount payable by the owner to the contractor. 10 H. 151, 153-154 (1895); 14 H. 448, 452, 453 (1902).\n\nWhere lien applicant contended that the value of the work exceeded the contract price, there was no merit in applicant's complaint that the court cut short applicant's presentation of evidence on the amount expended in doing the work. 2 H. App. 90, 626 P.2d 204 (1981).\n\nMaterialman may rely upon lien given by law as well as upon the personal liability of the subcontractor and in absence of any showing to the contrary it is presumed that he intended to avail himself of both remedies so far as necessary. 14 H. 448 (1902).\n\nRelieved by voluntary payments by owner, when. 32 H. 913 (1933).",

      "text": "§507-43 Filing notice, contents.(a) Requirements. Any person claiming a lien shall apply therefor to the circuit court of the circuit where the property is situated. Such \"Application For A Lien\" shall be accompanied by a written \"Notice Of Lien\" setting forth the alleged facts by virtue of which the person claims a lien. A copy of the Application and Notice shall be served in the manner prescribed by law for service of summons upon the owner of the property and any person with an interest therein and upon the party or parties who contracted for the improvements if other than the owner of the property or any person with an interest therein. If any person entitled to notice cannot be served as herein provided, notice may be given the person by posting the same on the improvement. The Application shall set forth the amount of the claim, the labor or material furnished, a description of the property sufficient to identify the same, and any other matter necessary to a clear understanding of the claim. If the claim has been assigned, the name of the assignor shall be stated. The Application shall specify the names of the parties who contracted for the improvement, the name of the general contractor and the names of the owners of the property and any person with an interest therein. The Application may (but need not) specify the names of the mortgagees or other encumbrancers of the property, if any, and the name of the surety of the general contractor, if any.\n\nThe Application and Notice shall be returnable not less than three nor more than ten days after service. On the return day, a hearing shall be held by the court to determine whether probable cause exists to permit the lien to attach to the property. Any person to whom notice is required to be given shall be permitted to offer testimony and documentary evidence on the issue of whether probable cause exists to permit the lien to attach. If the person who contracted for the improvement from which the requested lien arises claims a set-off against the lienor or if any person to whom notice is required to be given otherwise disputes the amount of the requested lien, the court shall hear and receive all admissible evidence offered and shall only permit the attachment of a lien in the net amount which the court determines is the reasonable probable outcome of any such dispute. The return day hearing may be continued at the order of the court so that the entire controversy need not be determined on the originally scheduled return day. The lien shall not attach to the property until the court finds probable cause exists and so orders. No such order shall be entered before the Application and Notice have been served on the party contracting for the improvement, the general contractor and the owner of the property, and they were given an opportunity to appear at the hearing.\n\n(b) Time for filing. The Application and Notice shall be filed not later than forty-five days after the date of completion of the improvement against which it is filed. Where title to the property involved, or any portion thereof, is registered in the land court and the lien is not claimed solely against the lessees' interest in one or more leasehold time share interests as described in section 501-20, it shall be incumbent upon the lienor to file a certified copy of the Order Directing Lien To Attach in the office of the assistant registrar of the land court within seven days after the entry thereof in order to preserve the lienor's rights against subsequent encumbrancers and purchasers of the property.\n\n(c) Joint owner. If the fee title to the land involved is held in joint or common ownership or as an estate by the entirety, service upon one of the owners of the Application and Notice in accordance with this section shall be deemed service upon all of the owners. Likewise, if the parties who contracted for the improvement, if other than the owner of fee title to the property involved, hold their interest in the premises in joint or common ownership, or as an estate by the entirety, service upon one of the parties of the Application and Notice in accordance with this section shall be deemed service upon all of the parties.\n\n(d) Owner acting through attorney-in-fact. In cases where materials have been furnished or labor was performed at the request, or upon the order, of a person acting under a duly executed and acknowledged power of attorney from the owner and:\n\n(1) The power of attorney has not been revoked; or\n\n(2) The power of attorney has been revoked subsequent to the furnishing of materials and labor upon request or order and the owner cannot be found within the State,\n\nservice of the Application and Notice upon the person acting under the power of attorney shall be deemed service upon the owner.\n\n(e) Duration of lien. The lien shall expire three months after the entry of the Order Directing Lien to Attach unless proceedings are commenced within that time to collect the amount due thereon by enforcing the same.\n\n(f) Date of completion, notice of. The term \"date of completion\" as used in this section means the time when the owner or the general contractor for the improvement completes the publication of a notice that the improvement has been completed or has been abandoned and an affidavit of the publication, together with a copy of the notice has been filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court where the property involved is situated; provided that notice of completion shall not be effective for any purpose unless prior to the notice there has been substantial completion of the improvement or the improvement has been actually abandoned; and provided further that the notice shall not be published by the contractor until after the contractor has first made written demand upon the owner to publish the notice and the owner has failed to publish the notice within five days from the date of the demand. The publication of the notice by the contractor or the owner shall not be construed as an admission by either that the improvement has been satisfactorily completed. The notice required herein shall be published twice, seven days apart, in a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in the county in which the property involved is situated, and the publishing newspaper shall promptly file the affidavit of publication above mentioned in the office of the clerk.\n\n(g) Failure to file or publish notice. If a valid notice of completion is not published and filed within one year after the actual completion or abandonment of the improvement the \"date of completion\" shall be deemed to be one year after actual completion or abandonment.

The owner or the owner's assigns on whose property the lien has attached may file a third-party action against a licensed contractor whom the owner has paid for improvements as provided for in section 444-28(g).

      "text": "§507-82 Liens on attorneys; certified shorthand reporter services.(a) Subject to the notice requirements in subsection (b) and the exemptions described in subsection (d), a certified shorthand reporter furnishing a stenographic record of any judicial proceeding, deposition, statement, or interview of a party in a proceeding or a copy of the stenographic record to an attorney at the attorney's request shall create a debt owing to the certified shorthand reporter by the attorney's firm, partnership, corporation, company, or other legal entity pursuant to which the attorney practices law, which may be enforced by the certified shorthand reporter in circuit or district court, as applicable. The amount of the debt shall not exceed the payment agreed to between the attorney and the certified shorthand reporter at the time the stenographic services are requested.\n\n(b) Concurrently with the delivery to the requesting attorney of the completed stenographic record or the final component or part thereof, or as soon as a tally of recoverable costs can be calculated, the certified shorthand reporter shall deliver an invoice listing the amount due for the stenographic services. If the requesting attorney does not pay for the stenographic record within sixty days of the receipt of the completed stenographic record and the invoice, the certified shorthand reporter may send a notice to the attorney that a lien in the amount described in subsection (a) shall be imposed on the assets of the attorney's firm, partnership, corporation, company, or other legal entity pursuant to which the attorney practices law, within fifteen calendar days. Thereafter, if payment is not made to the certified shorthand reporter, the lien may be enforced by the certified shorthand reporter as allowed by law.\n\n(c) The requesting attorney, or the attorney's firm, partnership, corporation, company, or other legal entity pursuant to which the attorney practices law, may dispute the amount due to the stenographic services listed in the invoice or the completeness or accuracy of the stenographic record at any time, and may seek declaratory relief from the circuit court that the debt is not owed. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an attorney or the attorney's firm, partnership, corporation, company, or other legal entity pursuant to which the attorney practices law, from pursuing a third-party claim against the requesting attorney's client for payment of stenographic services.\n\n(d) This section shall not apply when:\n\n(1) Payment to the certified shorthand reporter is otherwise provided by law; or\n\n(2) The attorney expressly disclaims responsibility for payment of the stenographic service or record, in writing, at the time that the attorney orders or requests that a record be made.
