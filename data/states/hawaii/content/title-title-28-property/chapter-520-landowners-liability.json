Supp. 256 (1988).\n\nWhere plaintiff alleged that the United States navy received a financial benefit from the Pearl Harbor bike path when its members commuted by bicycle on the bike path, reducing the need for parking spaces at Pearl Harbor naval station, and that the city of Honolulu's bicycle registration fee constituted a \"charge\" under Hawaii recreational use statute (HRUS), the United States did not charge plaintiff to enter the bike path and the \"charge\" exception to HRUS was not applicable. 180 F.

Supp. 226 (1986).\n\nFalse appearance of safety created by placement of inadequate or untrained lifeguards on beach, might result in potentially dangerous condition above and beyond natural danger created by ocean currents and surf; thus, government may be held liable to extent it created, and maliciously or wilfully failed to guard or warn against, the danger. 902 F. Supp. 1207 (1995).\n\nGiven staffing, training, and equipping of lifeguards on beach on day in question, beach was not rendered more dangerous than it would be for swimmers in its natural untouched state, where training of lifeguards was adequate; thus, question whether United States knew that its actions had rendered beach more dangerous for swimmers was answered in the negative, since United States' knowledge was irrelevant; plaintiff also failed to prove wilfulness. 916 F. Supp. 1511 (1996).\n\nWhere plaintiff alleged that the United States navy received a financial benefit from the Pearl Harbor bike path when its members commuted by bicycle on the bike path, reducing the need for parking spaces at Pearl Harbor naval station, and that the city of Honolulu's bicycle registration fee constituted a \"charge\" under Hawaii recreational use statute (HRUS), the United States did not charge plaintiff to enter the bike path and the \"charge\" exception to HRUS was not applicable. 180 F.
