Two or more pieces of real property shall be considered as a single contiguous area if they would be contiguous except for the interposition or existence of a road, street, stream, fee lot, or other like interference.\n\n\"Fair market value\" means that amount of money that a purchaser willing, but not obliged, to buy an interest in land would pay an owner willing, but not obliged, to sell it, taking into consideration all uses to which the land is adapted or might in reason be applied.\n\n\"Fee simple lands\" means absolute ownership of land for an indefinite duration, freely transferable and inheritable. For the purposes of this chapter, a lessee shall be deemed to own fee simple lands if such fee simple real property is held under any trust agreement or fiduciary arrangement in which another person holds legal title to the land and where the lessee, whether as trustee, co-trustee or beneficiary, holds or retains the controlling interest and right to direct the trust with regard to management or control of the trust or its assets.\n\n\"Fee simple owner\" and \"fee owner\" mean the person who owns the fee simple title to the land which is leased, including a life tenant with a remainder over, vested or contingent, and a holder of a defeasible estate, and the holder's heirs, successors, legal representatives, and assigns.\n\n\"Lease\" means a conveyance of land or an interest in land, by a fee simple owner as lessor, or by a lessee or sublessee as sublessor, to any person, in consideration of a return of rent or other recompense, for a term, measured from the initial date of the conveyance, twenty years or more (including any periods for which the lease may be extended or renewed at the option of the lessee).\n\n\"Leased fee\" and \"leased fee interest\" means all of the interests of the fee owner, lessor, and all legal and equitable owners of the land which is leased, other than the lessee's interest as defined by this chapter.\n\n\"Legal and equitable owners\" means the fee simple owner and all persons having legal or equitable interests in the fee or in the lessor's leasehold estate, including mortgagees, developers, lienors, and sublessors, and their respective heirs, successors, legal representatives, and assigns.\n\n\"Lessee\" means any person to whom land is leased or subleased, and the lessee's heirs, successors, legal representatives, and assigns.\n\n\"Lessor\" means any person who leases or subleases land to another, and the lessor's heirs, successors, legal representatives, and assigns.\n\nThe terms \"lessor\", \"lessee\", \"fee simple owner\", \"fee owner\", and \"legal and equitable owners\" include individuals, both masculine and feminine, and, except as to the term \"lessee\", the terms also include corporations, firms, associations, trusts, estates, and the State or its political subdivisions. When more than one person are the lessors, lessees, fee simple owners, fee owners, or legal and equitable owners of a lot, the terms apply to each of them, jointly and severally.\n\n\"Lot\", \"houselot\", \"residential lot\", and \"residential houselot\" mean a parcel of land, two acres or less in size, zoned for residential use, which is used or occupied or is developed, devoted, intended, or permitted to be used or occupied as a principal place of residence for one or two families.\n\n\"Offsite improvements\" means all physical improvements such as, but not limited to, roads, sewer lines, sewage treatment plants, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, fire hydrants, street lights, land dedicated for public purposes and underground electric cables, constructed or placed in a subdivision off the lots intended for occupancy, which improvements are to be used in common by occupants of all lots adjoining such improvements or by the occupants of all lots for whose benefit the improvements have been constructed or placed.\n\n\"Onsite improvements\" means all physical improvements placed on a residential lot intended for occupancy which improvements are for the benefits of occupants of that lot, including, but not limited to, dwelling units, garages, service buildings, stairs, walkways, driveways, walls, trees, shrubs, landscaping, and pools.\n\n\"Owner's basis\" means the value of the lessor's leased fee interest in the lot that would apply if the interests were normally traded on an open market. The fair market value of the owner's basis shall be established to provide the lessor with just compensation for the lessor's interests in the lot and shall take into consideration every interest and equity of the lessee in establishing that market value. The value may be determined by either of the following methods, or any other method that is normally used by qualified appraisers in establishing the fair market value of a lessor's leased fee interest in land:\n\n(1) The sum of:\n\n(A) The future rental income stream for the lot for the term of the lease discounted to present worth from the expiration date of the lease; and\n\n(B) The value of the lessor's reversionary interest in the lot discounted to present worth from the expiration date of the lease.\n\nThe discount rate shall be based on the maximum rate of return for insured passbook demand savings account paid by the savings and loan institutions in Hawaii plus three and three-fourths per cent; provided that the discount rate may be modified by mutual agreement of the lessor, lessee, and the corporation; or\n\n(2) The current fair market value of the lot, valued as if it were a fee simple lot and as if the fee title were unencumbered, and excluding onsite improvements, established by a market data approach utilizing comparable sales, less the following:\n\n(A) The value of the lease, including any rights therein, if any, that accrues to the lessee;\n\n(B) That percentage of the general enhancement of the neighborhood that has been paid for or contributed directly or indirectly by the lessee;\n\n(C) The current replacement cost of that portion of existing offsite improvements, including overhead and profit at prevailing rates, that were paid for or otherwise contributed, directly or indirectly, by the lessee;\n\n(D) That percentage of the general enhancement of the development tract and the lot caused by the onsite improvements on the lot paid for, or contributed, directly or indirectly, by the lessee;\n\n(E) That amount, not otherwise deducted herein, allocated to the lot that was paid for or otherwise contributed, directly or indirectly, by the original lessee, computed at prevailing rates for overhead and profit in developing the development tract established by existing practice in the community; and\n\n(F) That amount for fees and costs that would ordinarily be borne by the lessor in transferring interest to the lessee, including but not limited to attorneys' or realtors' commissions, other costs of sale, and similar fee;\n\nprovided that the values established by any one of the provisions in subparagraphs (A) to (F) shall not be duplicated in any one of the other provisions.\n\n\"Sustainable affordable development\" means a development tract that satisfies all of the following requirements:\n\n(1) The sales price at the time of initial sale of at least thirty per cent of all the residential lots in the development tract shall be limited in accordance with directly applicable state or county law, regulation, policy, or agreement, such that households earning not more than the required percentages of the median income for the applicable county (according to the directly applicable law, regulation, policy or agreement) will be required to spend no more than the allowable percentage of their gross incomes for housing costs as determined by secondary mortgage market standards or as otherwise agreed, all as determined as of the time of the initial sale of the residential lots;\n\n(2) The sales price at the time of the initial sale of at least fifty-one per cent of the residential lots in the development tract, including the lots subject to the requirements of paragraph (1), and the sales price at the time of a resale of at least fifty-one per cent of all the residential lots in the development tract, shall be no higher than eighty per cent of the fair market value of the residential lots in fee at the time of initial sale or resale, as appropriate, including all buildings and improvements, unencumbered by the restrictions of the lease;\n\n(3) All residential lots sold in satisfaction of paragraph (1) or (2) shall be leased under sustainable affordable leases;\n\n(4) The state or county agency that approves the sustainable affordable development may reduce the minimum percentage of residential lots to be sold in satisfaction of paragraph (1) or (2) upon a showing that the sustainable affordable development comprises a portion of a housing project that includes other housing, which together with the residential lots comprising the sustainable affordable development, satisfies the state or county agency's affordable housing requirements as set forth in the applicable state or county law, regulation, policy, or agreement; and\n\n(5) For the purposes of this chapter, the residential lots in a development tract comprising a sustainable affordable development are not required to be in a single contiguous area as long as all non-contiguous lots are:\n\n(A) Within a ten-mile radius of each other; and\n\n(B) Leased by the same fee owner under a sustainable affordable lease.\n\n\"Sustainable affordable lease\" means a residential lot lease in a sustainable affordable development that satisfies all of the following requirements:\n\n(1) The lease provides for a consideration to the fee owner below a fair market return on the fair market value of the land; provided that compensation to the fee owner for land, including lease rent, shall be either:\n\n(A) Totally capitalized into the initial sales price for the residential lot, including all buildings and improvements; or\n\n(B) Partially capitalized with a share of appreciation paid to the lessor upon resale of the residential lot;\n\n(2) In order to maintain the continued affordability of the residential lot, the lease limits the lessee's maximum sales price on the residential lot upon resale, including all buildings and improvements, to the lesser of:\n\n(A) The fair market value of the residential lot, including all buildings and improvements, encumbered by the restrictions of the lease; or\n\n(B) The sum of:\n\n(i) The lessee's purchase price for the residential lot, including all buildings and improvements;\n\n(ii) Any appreciation on the residential lot, including all buildings and improvements as measured by multiplying the amount in clause (i) by the increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers as determined by the United States Department of Labor for the applicable county (or if not published for the county, then for the State), from the date of the purchase to the date of the contract for resale; and\n\n(iii) The fair market value of all lessor-approved capital improvements made by the lessee; and\n\n(3) The lease may allow the lessor to receive a share of the appreciation in accordance with paragraph (2), as agreed to by the lessor and lessee, and as set forth in the sustainable affordable lease.

If the purchaser disagrees with the value, the purchaser may appoint the purchaser's own appraiser at the purchaser's own cost and any further disagreement on the value may be resolved by negotiation or otherwise.\n\n(b) Within sixty days after the receipt of the notice the corporation shall in writing notify the purchaser at the address so specified whether it elects to exercise its option. The date of election to purchase shall constitute the date of valuation for repurchase. Nonpayment of the purchase price by the corporation within ninety days from the date of election shall constitute a default and shall void the election and terminate the right to exercise the option by the corporation. If the corporation refuses, or fails within the sixty-day period to reply to the offer, the purchaser may sell the fee simple interest in the property, or lease the property for a period not to exceed one year, to any person, free from any price restrictions; provided that if the purchaser leases the property, the purchaser shall, upon expiration of the term of the lease, again comply with the requirements of subsection (a) whenever the expiration date of the term of the lease is within the ten-year period stated in subsection (a); further provided that if the purchaser notifies the corporation of the purchaser's intention to sell the property, but does not sell or lease the property within two years after the date the notice was received by the corporation, the purchaser must again comply with the requirements of subsection (a) if the ten-year period stated in subsection (a) has not expired.\n\n(c) The corporation may lease, rent, or resell, any lot and improvements purchased by it under this part.\n\n(d) Any original lease, deed, agreement of sale, mortgage, and other instruments of conveyance issued by the corporation under this part shall expressly contain the restriction on sale and use of the residential lot as prescribed by this section.

      "heading": "Legislative findings and declaration of necessity; purpose.",
      "text": "§516-83 Legislative findings and declaration of necessity; purpose.(a) The legislature finds that:\n\n(1) There is a concentration of land ownership in the State in the hands of a few landowners who have refused to sell the fee simple titles to their lands and who have instead engaged in the practice of leasing their lands under long-term leases;\n\n(2) The refusal of such landowners to sell the fee simple titles to their lands and the proliferation of such practice of leasing rather than selling land has resulted in a serious shortage of fee simple residential land and in an artificial inflation of residential land values in the State;\n\n(3) Due to such shortage of fee simple residential land and such artificial inflation of residential land values, the people of the State have been deprived of a choice to own or take a lease of the land on which their homes are situated and have been required instead to accept long-term leases of such land which contain terms and conditions that are financially disadvantageous, that restrict their freedom to fully enjoy such land and that are weighted heavily in favor of the few landowners of such land;\n\n(4) The economy of the State and the public interest, health, welfare, security, and happiness of the people of the State are adversely affected by such shortage of fee simple residential land and artificial inflation of residential land values and by such deprivation of the people of the State of the choice to own or take a lease of the land on which their homes are situated and the required acceptance of such long-term leases of such lands;\n\n(5) The acquisition of residential land in fee simple, absolute or otherwise, at fair and reasonable prices by people who are lessees under long-term leases of such land and on which such land their homes are situated and the ability of such people to fully enjoy such land through ownership of such land in fee simple will alleviate these conditions and will promote the economy of the State and public interest, health, welfare, security, and happiness of the people of the State;\n\n(6) The cost of living in Hawaii is and has been high. In recent years inflation has drastically increased the cost of living in the State. The spiraling cost of living affects all people through erosion of the purchasing power of whatever monetary resources they command. For a growing proportion of Hawaii's population, quite possibly a majority, the high cost of living is denying them such basic necessities as sufficient nutritional intake, safe and healthy housing accommodations, clothing, and adequate preventive and curative health services. A substantive and significant contributing factor to the high and rising cost of living is the high cost of land whether leasehold or fee. Stabilizing the costs of land or, at least, slowing the artificial inflation of land values would curb the rising cost of living in Hawaii and, ultimately, contribute to the welfare of all people of the State by improving their standard of living;\n\n(7) The Constitution of the State of Hawaii provides the State the power to provide assistance for persons unable to maintain a standard of living compatible with decency and health. The rising cost of land tied to other cost of living increases is swelling the ranks of those persons unable to maintain a decent and healthful standard of life. If the inflationary trend of land continues unchecked, the resultant inflationary total cost of living could create such a large population of persons deprived of decent and healthful standards of life that the consequent disruptions in lawful social behavior could irreparably rend the social fabric which now protectively covers the life and safety of all Hawaii's people. The threat posed by this possibility is sufficiently real and imminent to warrant state action to redistribute land as a means of curbing continuing inflationary rises in land values;\n\n(8) The right to own land is not an irrevocable grant of a special privilege where it operates against the general welfare of the many for the particular benefit of the few;\n\n(9) Land, in common with other natural resources, is of finite quantity; a fact particularly obvious in Hawaii. In recent decades there has been growing general agreement that the wise conservation, preservation, use and management of exhaustible natural resources such as land are matters mandating an active governmental role. There is an intimate relationship between the monetary values accorded land in Hawaii and the stability and strength of the State's economy as a whole. Land values, artificially inflated by the high concentration of ownership, skew the state economy toward unnecessarily high levels. The pervasive and substantial contribution made to inflation by high land values creates a potential for economic instability and disruption. Economic inflation, instability and disruptions have real and potential damaging consequences for all members of an affected society. Checking inflation, improving the stability of the economy, and forestalling disadvantageous economic disruptions all are productive of general benefit to all members of the Hawaiian society. The sound and wise conservation, preservation, use and management of land cannot be separated from the subject of patterns of land ownership. To accomplish the public purposes of wisely conserving, preserving, using, and managing the land in the State requires changing present patterns of land ownership. Public laws, expenditures, programs, and policies which contribute to the realization of these public purposes serve a public use since they ultimately benefit the entire community. Changing present patterns of land ownership by allowing lessees under long-term leases of residential land to purchase in fee simple, absolute or otherwise, the land on which their homes are situated, through governmental intervention including exercise of the power of eminent domain to acquire fee simple title to such land and public financing of such purchase and such condemnation and payment through the issuance of bonds, the expenditure of general revenue funds, and the use of private funds which are at the disposal of the State, will help satisfy the pressing public necessity for a secure, strong and stable economy;\n\n(10) The State's acquisition of residential lands held in fee simple, through the exercise of the power of eminent domain, for the purposes of this chapter is for the public use and purpose of protecting the public safety, health and welfare of all people in Hawaii;\n\n(11) Inflation lessens the quality of life of all members of this afflicted society and is particularly invidious in its impact on the ninety plus per cent of the population who are in the poverty, and low through middle income groups. The State has limited abilities to curb inflation and, perhaps, the only useful means available is the State's power to control land values. There is a pressing public necessity for the State to do whatever it can to curb inflation and to keep the cost of living at a level where it is possible and manageable to provide all citizens a decent and healthful standard of life. The public use and purpose of providing all citizens a decent and healthful standard of life will be directly and substantially furthered by the State's acquisition of residential lands held in fee simple, through the exercise of the power of eminent domain, for the purposes of this chapter;\n\n(12) The use of the power of eminent domain to condemn the fee simple title to residential land and the payment of just compensation therefor for the purpose of making the fee simple title thereto and the use thereof available for acquisition by people who are lessees under long-term leases of such land and on which such land their homes are situated is for a public use and purpose;\n\n(13) Legislation providing to people who are lessees under long-term leases of residential land on which their homes are situated the ability to fully enjoy such land through ownership of such land in fee simple, absolute or otherwise, is for a public purpose.\n\n(b) It is therefore declared to be necessary and it is the purpose of this chapter to alleviate the conditions found in subsection (a) of this section by providing for the right of any person who is a lessee under a long-term lease of residential land in the State to purchase at a fair and reasonable price the fee simple title to such land, by providing for the condemnation of the fee simple title to such land and the payment of just compensation therefor by the State through the use of the power of eminent domain and by providing for the public financing of such purchase and such condemnation and payment through the issuance of bonds, the expenditure of general revenue funds, and the use of private funds which are at the disposal of the State.
