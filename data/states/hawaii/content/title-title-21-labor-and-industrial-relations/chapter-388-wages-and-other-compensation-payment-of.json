Supp. 2d 1145 (2011).\n\nIn reading §388-3 in the context of the entire statute and in light of the common law, the trial court did not err in concluding that payment for unused vacation upon separation from employment did not constitute \"wages\" under the plain meaning of this section. 108 H. 411, 121 P.3d 391 (2005).\n\nWhere defendant had authority over the operation of the hotels at which plaintiffs were employed, and defendant failed to raise an argument regarding defendant's status as \"employer\" until after the court had entered its final judgment, the circuit court did not err in concluding that defendant was an \"employer\" under this chapter. 133 H. 1, 323 P.3d 792 (2014).",

Supp. 1501 (1992).\n\nTo the extent that the legislative history of §481B-14 is relevant to the question of whether employees may sue for unpaid wages under this section based on violations of §481B-14, that legislative history, as interpreted by the Hawaii supreme court, provides support for the idea that employees may do so. 810 F. Supp. 2d 1145 (2011).\n\nPlaintiff resort employees' claim for unpaid wages brought pursuant to this section was not preempted by section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §185(a) where there was no need to look to, much less interpret the collective bargaining agreement (agreement) between defendant resort and plaintiffs, no need to consult or interpret the agreement, and defendants presented no evidence that there was a clear and unmistakable waiver in the agreement, as they are required to, if they seek to assert a party has waived a state-law right. 818 F. Supp. 2d 1240 (2010).\n\nThe legislative history of §481B-14, as interpreted by the Hawaii supreme court in Davis, allows plaintiff hotel employees to recover for unpaid service charges imposed without the requisite disclosure set forth in §481B-14, through a claim brought pursuant to § §388-10 and 388-11 and this section. 835 F. Supp. 2d 914 (2011).\n\nPlaintiffs could not bring a statutory claim under this section where plaintiffs sought to recover wages to which they failed to demonstrate they were legally entitled. Plaintiffs could not assert a legal right as third party beneficiaries to the amounts allegedly withheld by virtue of defendant employer's failure to pay the bargaining unit wage rates as set forth in the 2006 Addendum to defendant employer's contract and plaintiffs did not seek to recover withheld wages pursuant to a contractual agreement between plaintiffs and defendant employer. 105 F. Supp. 3d 1165 (2015).\n\nWhen a hotel or restaurant applying a service charge for the sale of food or beverage services allegedly violates §481B-14 by: (1) not distributing the full service charge directly to its employees as \"tip income\" (in other words, as \"wages and tips of employees\"); and (2) failing to disclose this practice to the purchaser of the services, the employees may bring an action under § §388-8 and 388-10 and this section to enforce the employees' rights and seek remedies. 130 H. 130, 306 P.3d 175 (2013).\n\nWhere employers imposed a service charge at banquets and other functions held at employers' hotels, and retained a portion of the service charge income without disclosing that practice to customers, the circuit court correctly held that \"tip income\" retained by employers in violation of §481B-14 constitutes \"compensation\" earned by service employees for purposes of bringing a claim under this section and § §388-10 and 388-11. 133 H. 1, 323 P.3d 792 (2014).",

With the consent of the assigning employee at the time of the assignment the director may settle and adjust any such claim to the same extent as might the assigning employee.

The general contractor's liability under this section shall extend only to unpaid wages to the claimant, including any interest owed, but shall not extend to penalties, consequential or liquidated damages, or any benefit, fringe benefit, or contribution claims.\n\nA general contractor shall not evade or commit any act that negates the requirements of this section; provided that this section does not prohibit a general contractor or subcontractor from contracting with or enforcing any lawful remedies against a subcontractor for the liability created by the nonpayment of wages by the subcontractor or by a subcontractor at any tier working under another subcontractor.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, actions to enforce a general contractor's liability for unpaid wages may include the following:\n\n(1) The director may enforce liability for unpaid wages established by subsection (a) against a general contractor; provided that the general contractor's liability shall be limited to unpaid wages, including any interest owed; or\n\n(2) A joint labor-management cooperation committee established pursuant to section 175a of the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978 (29 U.S.C. 175a) may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against a general contractor or subcontractor at any tier for unpaid wages owed to a claimant by the general contractor or subcontractor for the performance of private construction work not subject to chapter 104, including unpaid wages owed by the general contractor, pursuant to subsection (a). The court may award a prevailing party in the action reasonable attorney's fees and costs, including expert witness fees; provided that attorney's fees and costs, including expert witness fees, shall not be awarded against a general contractor for unpaid wages except for those of its direct employees. As a condition precedent to an action against a general contractor to enforce the liability established by subsection (a), the committee shall provide written notice to the general contractor and subcontractor who employed the claimant, within ninety days from the date on which the person did or performed the labor for which claim is made, but no later than forty-five days after the date of completion as defined in section 507-43, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party for whom the labor was done or performed.

The payroll records shall be marked or obliterated only to prevent disclosure of an employee's full social security number, except that the last four digits of the employee's social security number shall be provided. Upon request of a general contractor to a subcontractor, the subcontractor and any lower tier subcontractors under contract with the subcontractor shall provide the general contractor with award information that includes the project name, name and address of the subcontractor, lower-tier subcontractor with whom the subcontractor is under contract, anticipated start date, duration, estimated journeyperson and apprentice hours, and contact information for the subcontractors on the project. A subcontractor's failure to comply with this subsection shall not relieve a general contractor from any of the obligations contained in this section.\n\n(g) The obligations and remedies in this section shall be in addition to any obligations and remedies otherwise provided by law, except that nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability on a general contractor for anything other than unpaid wages to the claimant, including any interest owed, and shall not extend to penalties, consequential or liquidated damages, or any benefit, fringe benefit, or contribution claims.\n\n(h) Nothing in this section shall alter an owner's obligation to pay a general contractor, or the general contractor's obligation to pay a subcontractor, in a timely manner; provided that a general contractor may withhold all sums owed to a subcontractor if the subcontractor does not provide the information requested under subsection (f) in a timely manner and until the time that the information is provided.\n\n(i) The provisions of this section shall be severable. If any provision of this section or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.\n\n(j) For purposes of this section:\n\n\"General contractor\" means a contractor who has a direct contractual relationship with an owner.\n\n\"Subcontractor\" means a contractor who does not have a direct contractual relationship with an owner. \"Subcontractor\" includes a contractor who has a contractual relationship with a general contractor or with another subcontractor.
