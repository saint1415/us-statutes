Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine whether benefits are not payable to them because of their alien status shall be uniformly required from all applicants for benefits.

Evidence includes:\n\n(A) Certified or exemplified restraining orders, injunctions against harassment, and documents from criminal cases;\n\n(B) Documentation from a victim services organization or domestic or sexual violence program, agency, or facility, including a shelter or safe house for victims of domestic or sexual violence;\n\n(C) Documentation from a medical professional, mental health care provider, attorney, advocate, social worker, or member of the clergy from whom the employee or the employee's minor child has sought assistance in relation to the domestic or sexual violence; or\n\n(D) Statements from the individual, or other corroborating evidence.\n\nAs used in this paragraph, \"domestic or sexual violence\" includes domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking; or\n\n(13) Any other factor relevant to a determination of good cause.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section:\n\n\"Part-time\" means less than twenty hours per week or on-call or casual or intermittent.

Such election shall not be terminable by the organization for that and the next calendar year.\n\n(E) The department may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election, or a notice of termination, must be filed and may permit an election to be retroactive but not any earlier than with respect to benefits paid after December 31, 1971.\n\n(F) The department, in accordance with such regulations as the director of labor and industrial relations may prescribe, shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination which it may make of such organization's status as an employer and of the effective date of any election which such organization makes and of any termination of such election. Such determination shall be conclusive upon such organization unless, within fifteen days after the notice thereof was mailed to its last known address or otherwise delivered to it, such organization files with the department an application for review and redetermination, setting forth the reasons therefor. The department shall promptly review and reconsider its determination and shall thereafter issue a redetermination in any case in which such application has been filed. Any such redetermination shall be conclusive upon the organization unless, within fifteen days after the redetermination was mailed to its last known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files written notice of appeal with the department, setting forth the reasons for the appeal.

Any such redetermination shall be conclusive on the organization unless, within fifteen days after the redetermination was mailed to its last known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization filed written notice of appeal with the department, setting forth the reasons for the appeal. The appeal shall be heard by a referee in accordance with applicable provisions of sections 383-38 and 383-39, and the decision of the referee shall be subject to the provisions of section 383-41.\n\n(3) Provision of security.

If the nonprofit organization did not pay wages in each of the four calendar quarters of such calendar year, the amount of the deposit shall be as determined by the department.\n\n(B) Any deposit of money in accordance with this paragraph shall be retained by the department in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereinafter provided. The department may deduct from the money deposited under this paragraph by a nonprofit organization to the extent necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid payments in lieu of contributions. The department shall require the organization within thirty days following any deduction from a money deposit under the provisions of this subparagraph to deposit sufficient additional money to make whole the organization's deposit at the prior level. The department may, at any time, review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as a result of such review, the department determines that an adjustment is necessary, it shall require the organization to make additional deposit within thirty days of written notice of its determination or shall return to the organization such portion of the deposit as it no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate. Disposition of income from moneys held in escrow shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the state law.\n\n(C) If any nonprofit organization fails to make a deposit, or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided under this paragraph, the department may terminate such organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions and such termination shall continue for not less than the four-consecutive-calendar-quarter period beginning with the quarter in which such termination becomes effective; provided that the department may extend for good cause the applicable deposit or adjustment period by not more than thirty days.\n\n(e) Each employer, other than government employers, that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions under this section shall pay to the director of labor and industrial relations for the fund the amount of regular benefits plus the amount of one-half of extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employer. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one employer and one or more of such employers are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount payable to the fund by each employer that is liable for such payments shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) or paragraph (2).\n\n(1) Proportionate allocation when fewer than all base-period employers are liable for reimbursement. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by one or more employers that are liable for payments in lieu of contributions and on wages paid by one or more employers that are liable for contributions, the amount of benefits payable by each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base-period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base-period wages paid to the individual by all of the individual's base-period employers.\n\n(2) Proportionate allocation when all base-period employers are liable for reimbursement. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by two or more employers that are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount of benefits payable by each such employer shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base-period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base-period wages paid to the individual by all of the individual's base-period employers.\n\n(f) Two or more employers, including governmental employers, that have become liable for payments in lieu of contributions, may file a joint application to the department of labor and industrial relations for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each such application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group's agent for purposes of this subsection. Upon its approval of the application, the department shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the department receives the application, and it shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than two years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the department or upon application by the group. The director of labor and industrial relations shall prescribe such regulations as the director deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this paragraph, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this paragraph by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.\n\n(g) When a nonprofit organization terminates its self-financing status and elects to pay contributions under this chapter, any remaining amount of positive reserve balance in its self-financing account will be transferred to its contributory reserve account. The department shall determine the contribution rate of such employer in accordance with provisions of section [383-66(a)(2)].

      "text": "§383-66 Contribution rates, how determined.(a) The department, for the nine-month period April 1, 1941, to December 31, 1941, and for each calendar year thereafter, except as otherwise provided in this part, shall classify employers in accordance with their actual experience in the payment of contributions and with respect to benefits charged against their accounts with a view to fixing the contribution rates to reflect this experience. The department shall determine the contribution rate of each employer in accordance with the following requirements:\n\n(1) The standard rate of contributions payable by each employer for any calendar year through 1984 shall be three per cent. For calendar years 1985 and thereafter, the standard rate of contributions payable by each employer shall be five and four-tenths per cent;\n\n(2) No employer's rate for the calendar year 1942 and for any calendar year thereafter shall be other than the maximum rate unless and until the employer's account has been chargeable with benefits throughout the thirty-six consecutive calendar month period ending on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, except that, for the calendar year 1956 and for each calendar year thereafter, an employer who has not been subject to the law for a sufficient period to meet this requirement may qualify for a rate other than the maximum rate if the employer's account has been chargeable throughout a lesser period but in no event less than the twelve consecutive calendar month period ending on December 31 of the preceding calendar year. For the calendar years 1985 through 1991, the contribution rate for a new or newly covered employer shall be the sum of the employer's basic contribution rate of three and six-tenths per cent and the fund solvency contribution rate determined for that year pursuant to section 383-68(a), until the employer's account has been chargeable with benefits throughout the twelve consecutive calendar month period ending on December 31 of the preceding calendar year; except that no employer's contribution rate shall be greater than five and four-tenths per cent and no employer with a negative reserve ratio shall have a contribution rate less than the employer's basic contribution rate. For calendar years 1992 and thereafter, the contribution rate for a new or newly covered employer shall be the contribution rate assigned to any employer with .0000 reserve ratio, until the employer's account has been chargeable with benefits throughout the twelve consecutive calendar month period ending on December 31 of the preceding calendar year;\n\n(3) Any amount credited to this State under section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended, which has been appropriated for expenses of administration, whether or not withdrawn from the trust fund, shall be excluded from the fund for the purposes of this paragraph. Any advance that may be made to this State under section 1201 of the Social Security Act, whether or not withdrawn from this trust fund, shall be excluded from the fund for the purposes of this paragraph. No employer's rate shall be reduced in any amount that is not allowable as an additional credit, against the tax levied by the federal Unemployment Tax Act pursuant to section 3302(b) of the federal Internal Revenue Code or pursuant to any other federal statute, successor to section 3302(b), which provides for the additional credit now provided for in section 3302(b);\n\n(4) If, when any classification of employers is to be made (which may be after the commencement of the period for which the classification is to be made), the department finds that any employer has failed to file any report required in connection therewith or has filed a report that the department finds incorrect or insufficient, the department shall notify the employer thereof by mail addressed to the employer's last known address. Unless the employer files the report or a corrected or sufficient report, as the case may be, within fifteen days after the mailing of the notice, the maximum rate of contributions shall be payable by the employer for the period for which the contribution rate is to be fixed. Effective January 1, 1987, the director, for excusable failure, may redetermine the assignment of the maximum contribution rate in accordance with this section, provided the employer files all reports as required by the department and submits a written request for redetermination before December 31 of the year for which the contribution rate is to be fixed;\n\n(5) For the purpose of sections 383-63 to 383-69, if after December 31, 1939, any employing unit in any manner succeeds to or acquires the organization, trade, or business, or substantially all the assets thereof (whether or not the successor or acquiring unit was an \"employing unit\", as that term is defined in section 383-1 prior to the acquisition), or after December 31, 1988 and prior to December 31, 1992, acquires a clearly identifiable and segregable portion of the organization, trade, or business of another that at the time of the acquisition was an employer subject to this chapter, and the successor continues or resumes the organization, trade, or business and continues to employ all or nearly all of the predecessor's employees, or the successor continues or resumes the clearly identifiable and segregable portion of the organization, trade, or business and continues to employ all or nearly all of the employees of the clearly identifiable and segregable portion, an application may be made for transfer of the predecessor's experience record. If the predecessor employer has submitted all information and reports required by the department including amended quarterly wage reports identifying the employees transferred or retained and executed and filed with the department before December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the acquisition occurred on a form approved by the department a waiver relinquishing the rights to all or the clearly identifiable and segregable portion of the predecessor's prior experience record with respect to its separate account, actual contribution payment, and benefit chargeability experience, annual payrolls and other data for the purpose of obtaining a reduced rate, and requesting the department to permit the experience record to inure to the benefit of the successor employing unit upon request of the successor employing unit, the experience record for rate computation purposes of the predecessor shall thereupon be deemed the experience record of the successor and the experience record shall be transferred by the department to the successor employing unit and shall become the separate account of the employing unit as of the date of the acquisition. Benefits chargeable to the predecessor employer or successor employer in case of an acquisition of a clearly identifiable and segregable portion of the organization, trade, or business, after the date of acquisition on account of employment prior to the date of the acquisition shall be charged to the separate account of the successor employing unit. In case of an acquisition of a clearly identifiable and segregable portion of the organization, trade, or business, the experience record that inures to the benefit of the successor employer shall be determined as follows:\n\n(A) Wages, as used in section 383-61, attributable to the clearly identifiable and segregable portion shall be for the period beginning with the most recent three consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the determination of rates under sections 383-63 to 383-69 and through the date of acquisition; and\n\n(B) Reserve balance attributable to the clearly identifiable and segregable portion shall be the amount determined by dividing the wages, as used in section 383-61, of the clearly identifiable and segregable portion in the three calendar years (or that lesser period as the clearly identifiable and segregable portion may have been in operation) immediately preceding the computation date of the rating period prior to which the acquisition occurred by the total taxable payrolls of the predecessor for the three-year period (or that lesser period as the clearly identifiable and segregable portion may have been in operation) and multiplying the quotient by the reserve balance of the predecessor employer calculated as of the acquisition date;\n\nprovided the waiver or waivers required herein are filed with the department within sixty days after the date of acquisition, the successor employing unit, unless already an employer subject to this chapter, shall be subject from the date of acquisition to the rate of contribution of the predecessor or of two or more predecessors if they have the same contribution rate. If there are two or more predecessors having different contribution rates, the successor shall be subject to the rate prescribed for new or newly covered employers under paragraph (2) until the next determination of rates under sections 383-63 to 383-69, at which time the experience records of the predecessors and successor shall be combined and shall be deemed to be the experience record of a single employing unit and the successor's rate shall thereupon be determined upon the basis of the combined experience. If the successor at the time of the transfer is an employer subject to this chapter, the rate of contribution to which the successor is then subject shall remain the same until the next determination of rates under sections 383-63 to 383-69, at which time the experience records of the predecessor and successor shall be combined and shall be deemed to be the experience record of a single employing unit and the successor's rate shall thereupon be determined upon the basis of the combined experience. For the purpose of determination of rates under sections 383-63 to 383-69 of all successor employing units, waivers as required herein, if not previously filed as hereinabove provided, shall be filed with the department not later than March 1 of the year for which the rate is determined; provided that no waiver shall be accepted by the department for filing unless the employing unit executing the waiver has filed all reports and paid all contributions required by this chapter;\n\n(6) The department may prescribe rules for the establishment, maintenance, and dissolution of joint accounts by two or more employers, and, in accordance with the rules and upon application by two or more employers to establish such an account, or to merge their several individual accounts in a joint account, shall maintain the joint account as if it constituted a single employer's account. The rules shall be consistent with the federal requirements for additional credit allowance in section 3303 of the federal Internal Revenue Code and consistent with this chapter;\n\n(7) Whenever there is an amendment to this chapter which, if immediately effective, would change an employer's rate of contributions, the rate of the employer shall be changed in accordance with the amendment and the new rate shall apply for the remainder of the calendar year beginning with the calendar quarter immediately following the effective date of the amendment providing for the change, unless otherwise provided by the amendment;\n\n(8) For the purposes of this section, \"contribution rate\" shall mean the basic contribution rate as defined in section 383-68 when applied to calendar year 1978 or any calendar year thereafter; and\n\n(9) For the purposes of this section, the terms \"employing unit\", \"employer\", \"predecessor\", and \"successor\" shall include both the singular and the plural of each term. Nothing in this section shall prevent two or more successor employing units, which each succeed to or acquire a clearly identifiable and segregable portion of a predecessor employing unit, from gaining the benefit of the clearly identifiable and segregable portion of the predecessor's experience record;\n\nprovided that the terms of this section are complied with, nothing herein shall bar a predecessor employer from waiving the rights to all or the clearly identifiable and segregable portion of the predecessor's prior experience record in favor of a successor employer where the successor acquired a clearly identifiable and segregable portion of the predecessor's organization, trade, or business after December 31, 1988 and prior to December 31, 1992.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following shall apply regarding assignment of rates and transfers of experience:\n\n(1) If an employing unit transfers its organization, trade, or business, or a portion thereof, to another employing unit and, at the time of the transfer, there is substantially common ownership, management, or control of the two employing units, both employing units shall file a notification of the transfer with the department on a form approved by the department within thirty days after the date of the transfer. The department shall transfer the experience records attributable to the transferred organization, trade, or business to the employing unit to whom the organization, trade, or business is transferred.

If any employer is in default in the payment of any contributions required to be paid by the employer pursuant to this chapter, the director of labor and industrial relations may, when the amount of the contributions with respect to which the employer is delinquent is determined, either by the report of the employer or by the assessment by the department of labor and industrial relations, proceed to collect payment of the same by action in assumpsit, in the director's own name, on behalf of the State, for the amount of the contributions, costs, penalties, and interest. In such actions the several district courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts, irrespective of the amount claimed. Actions brought under this section shall be heard by the court at the earliest possible date and shall be entitled to preference upon the calendar of the court over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review under this chapter and cases arising under the workers' compensation law.\n\nNo proceedings in court for the collection of delinquent contributions shall be begun after the expiration of four years from the last day of the month following the last month of the quarter for which the contributions are due; provided that in the case of a false or fraudulent return or the wilful failure to file a return with intent to evade the payment of contributions, a proceeding in court for the collection of the contributions may be begun at any time.\n\n(b) Distraint. If the amount of contributions or interest assessed is not paid when due the director may collect payment of same by distress upon so much of the delinquent employer's goods, chattels, moneys, or intangibles represented by negotiable evidences of indebtedness, as the director may deem sufficient to satisfy the payment of contributions due, penalties, and interest if any, and the costs and expenses of distress. In the case of moneys, distress shall be effected by seizure, and in other cases distress shall be effected by seizure and sale of the property. The director shall take possession and keep the distrained property until the sale. After taking possession, the director shall sell the delinquent employer's interest in the property at public auction after first giving fifteen days' public notice of the time and place of the sale in the county where the sale is to be held, and by posting notice in at least three public places in the county where the sale is to be held. The director may require the assistance of any sheriff or authorized police officer of any county to aid in the seizure and sale of the distrained personal property. The director may further retain the services of any person competent and qualified to aid the sale of the distrained personal property, provided that the consent of the delinquent employer is obtained. Any sheriff or the person so retained by the director shall be paid a fair and reasonable fee but in no case shall the fee exceed ten per cent of the gross proceeds of the sale. Any person other than a sheriff so retained by the director to assist the director may be required to furnish a bond in an amount to be determined by the director. The fees and the cost of the bond shall constitute a part of the costs and expenses of the distress.\n\nThe sale shall take place within twenty days after seizure; provided that by public announcement at the sale, or at the time and place previously set for the sale, it may be extended for one week. Any further extension of the sale shall be with the consent of the delinquent employer. The sale, in any event shall be completed within forty-five days after seizure of the property. Sufficient property shall be sold to pay all contributions, penalties, interest, costs, and expenses. On payment of the price bid for any property sold, the delivery thereof with a bill of sale from the director shall vest the title of the property in the purchaser. No charge shall be made for the bill of sale. All surplus received upon any sale after the payment of the contributions, penalties, interest, costs, and expenses, shall be returned to the owner of the property sold, and until claimed shall be deposited in the director's office subject to the order of the owner. Any unsold portion of the property seized may be left at the place of sale at the risk of the owner. If the owner of the property seized desires to retain or regain possession thereof, the owner may give a sufficient bond and surety to produce the property at the time and place of sale or pay all contributions, penalties, interest, costs, and expenses.\n\n(c) Liens, foreclosure. The claim of the department for any contributions, including penalties and interest thereon, not paid when due, shall be a lien upon property as provided by section 231-33, and the powers conferred on the director of taxation by that section apply to these contributions, the same as other state taxes. However, as to the powers conferred on the director of taxation by section 231-33(h), such powers are, as to these contributions, conferred on the director of labor and industrial relations, and the lien may be foreclosed in a court proceeding or by distraint under this section.
