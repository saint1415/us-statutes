      "text": "§392-2 Findings and purpose.A large portion of the labor force of this State annually is disabled from pursuing gainful employment by reason of nonoccupational sickness or accident and as a result suffers serious loss of income. In approximately ten per cent of the cases such sickness or accident can be expected to cause disability of more than one week's duration. More than two-fifths of the employees in private employment have either no fixed legal protection against wage loss from disabling nonoccupational sickness or accident, or only protection for a period of one workweek or less; more than one-third of the workers covered by formal sick leave plans are not protected against disability extending beyond two workweeks. Since the hardship for workers and their families mounts with the extension of the duration of the disability from whatever cause, there is a need to fill the existing gaps in protection and to provide benefits to individuals in current employment that will afford to them reasonable compensation for wage loss caused by disabling nonoccupational sickness or accident where the disability is temporary in nature and exceeds the period of one workweek. This legislation is designed not to impede the growth of voluntary plans which afford additional protection.\n\nThis chapter shall be liberally construed in the light of the stated reasons for its enactment and its declared purpose. [L 1969, c 148, pt of §1]\n\nAttorney General Opinions\n\nWhere department has a TDI plan for its full-time teachers and a TDI plan for A+ employees, and an individual is employed by department as both a full-time teacher and an A+ employee and becomes disabled for both jobs, allowing department to pay only under one TDI plan would produce a harsh result that is contrary to the legislative intent to provide benefits commensurate with wage loss from all employments and this section's command to construe the statute \"liberally ... in the light of the stated reasons for its enactment\". Att. Gen. Op. 97-9.\n\nCited: 73 H. 403, 833 P.2d 890 (1992).",

Any plan or agreement referred to in this subparagraph may be extended, with or without modification, by agreement or collective bargaining between the employer or employers or an association of employers and an association of employees; provided the benefits under the plan or agreement, as extended or modified, are found by the director to be at least as favorable as the disability benefits required by this chapter.\n\n(B) Any other plan or agreement in existence on January 1, 1970, which the employer may, by the employer's sole act, terminate at any time, or with respect to which the employer is not obligated to continue for any period to make contributions, may be accepted by the director as satisfying the obligation to provide for the payment of benefits under this chapter if the plan or agreement provides benefits at least as favorable as the disability benefits required by this chapter and does not require contributions of any employee or of any class or classes of employees in excess of the amount authorized in section 392-43, except by agreement and provided the contribution is reasonably related to the value of the benefits as determined by the director. The director may require the employer to enter into an agreement in writing with the director that until the employer shall have filed written notice with the director of the employer's election to terminate such plan or agreement or to discontinue making necessary contributions toward the cost of providing benefits under the plan or agreement, the employer will continue to provide for the payment of the disability benefits under the plan or agreement.

Any employer applying for such insurance or any insured under such plan and any insurer affected may appeal to the commissioner from any ruling or decision of the manager or committee designated to operate such plan. All orders of the commissioner in connection with any such plan shall be subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 91.\n\n(g) All insurers shall in form prescribed by the director notify employer applicants who are unable to procure the required insurance through ordinary methods, the availability of the plan described in [subsection] (f) above.
