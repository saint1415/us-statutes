After the payment of the expenses and attorneys' fees, there shall be applied out of the amount of the judgment for damages, or settlement proceeds an amount sufficient to reimburse the employer for the amount of the employer's expenditure for compensation and any excess shall be paid to the injured employee or other person entitled thereto.\n\n(h) If the parties are unable to agree upon the amount of reasonable litigation expenses and the amount of attorneys' fees under this section, the expenses and attorneys' fees shall be fixed by the court.\n\n(i) After reimbursement for the employer's compensation payments, the employer shall be relieved from the obligation to make further compensation payments to the employee under this chapter up to the entire amount of the balance of the settlement or the judgment, if satisfied, as the case may be, after deducting the cost and expenses, including attorneys' fees.\n\n(j) The amount of compensation paid by the employer or the amount of compensation to which the injured employee is entitled shall not be admissible in evidence in any action brought to recover damages.\n\n(k) Another employee of the same employer shall not be relieved of that employee's liability as a third party, if the personal injury is caused by that employee's wilful and wanton misconduct.\n\n(l) If the special compensation fund has paid or is liable for any compensation under this chapter, the fund shall be entitled to all the rights and remedies granted an employer under this section; provided that the employer's right to reimbursement for compensation payments and expenses under this chapter shall have priority.

The liability for the medical care, services, and supplies shall be subject to the deductible under section 386-100.\n\n(b) Whenever medical care is needed, the injured employee may select any physician or surgeon who is practicing on the island where the injury was incurred to render medical care. If the services of a specialist are indicated, the employee may select any physician or surgeon practicing in the State. The director may authorize the selection of a specialist practicing outside the State where no comparable medical attendance within the State is available. Upon procuring the services of a physician or surgeon, the injured employee shall give proper notice of the employee's selection to the employer within a reasonable time after the beginning of the treatment. If for any reason during the period when medical care is needed, the employee wishes to change to another physician or surgeon, the employee may do so in accordance with rules prescribed by the director. If the employee is unable to select a physician or surgeon and the emergency nature of the injury requires immediate medical attendance, or if the employee does not desire to select a physician or surgeon and so advises the employer, the employer shall select the physician or surgeon. The selection, however, shall not deprive the employee of the employee's right of subsequently selecting a physician or surgeon for continuance of needed medical care.\n\n(c) The liability of the employer for medical care, services, and supplies shall be limited to the charges computed as set forth in this section. The director shall make determinations of the charges and adopt fee schedules based upon those determinations. Effective January 1, 1997, and for each succeeding calendar year thereafter, the charges shall not exceed one hundred ten per cent of fees prescribed in the Medicare Resource Based Relative Value Scale applicable to Hawaii as prepared by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, except as provided in this subsection. The rates or fees provided for in this section shall be adequate to ensure at all times the standard of services and care intended by this chapter to injured employees.\n\nIf the director determines that an allowance under the medicare program is not reasonable or if a medical treatment, accommodation, product, or service existing as of June 29, 1995, is not covered under the medicare program, the director, at any time, may establish an additional fee schedule or schedules not exceeding the prevalent charge for fees for services actually received by providers of health care services, to cover charges for that treatment, accommodation, product, or service. If no prevalent charge for a fee for service has been established for a given service or procedure, the director shall adopt a reasonable rate which shall be the same for all providers of health care services to be paid for that service or procedure.\n\nThe director shall update the schedules required by this section every three years or annually, as required. The updates shall be based upon:\n\n(1) Future charges or additions prescribed in the Medicare Resource Based Relative Value Scale applicable to Hawaii as prepared by the United States Department of Health and Human Services; or\n\n(2) A statistically valid survey by the director of prevalent charges for fees for services actually received by providers of health care services or based upon the information provided to the director by the appropriate state agency having access to prevalent charges for medical fee information.\n\nWhen a dispute exists between an insurer or self-insured employer and a medical services provider regarding the amount of a fee for medical services, the director may resolve the dispute in a summary manner as the director may prescribe; provided that a provider shall not charge more than the provider's private patient charge for the service rendered.\n\nWhen a dispute exists between an employee and the employer or the employer's insurer regarding the proposed treatment plan or whether medical services should be continued, the employee shall continue to receive essential medical services prescribed by the treating physician necessary to prevent deterioration of the employee's condition or further injury until the director issues a decision on whether the employee's medical treatment should be continued. The director shall make a decision within thirty days of the filing of a dispute. If the director determines that medical services pursuant to the treatment plan should be or should have been discontinued, the director shall designate the date after which medical services for that treatment plan are denied. The employer or the employer's insurer may recover from the employee's personal health care provider qualified pursuant to section 386-27, or from any other appropriate occupational or non-occupational insurer, all the sums paid for medical services rendered after the date designated by the director. Under no circumstances shall the employee be charged for the disallowed services, unless the services were obtained in violation of section 386-98. The attending physician, employee, employer, or insurance carrier may request in writing that the director review the denial of the treatment plan or the continuation of medical services.\n\n(d) The director, with input from stakeholders in the workers' compensation system, including but not limited to insurers, health care providers, employers, and employees, shall establish standardized forms for health care providers to use when reporting on and billing for injuries compensable under this chapter. The forms may be in triplicate, or in any other configuration so as to minimize, to the extent practicable, the need for a health care provider to fill out multiple forms describing the same workers' compensation case to the department, the injured employee's employer, and the employer's insurer.\n\n(e) If it appears to the director that the injured employee has wilfully refused to accept the services of a competent physician or surgeon selected as provided in this section, or has wilfully obstructed the physician or surgeon, or medical, surgical, or hospital services or supplies, the director may consider such refusal or obstruction on the part of the injured employee to be a waiver in whole or in part of the right to medical care, services, and supplies, and may suspend the weekly benefit payments, if any, to which the employee is entitled so long as the refusal or obstruction continues.\n\n(f) Any funds as are periodically necessary to the department to implement the foregoing provisions may be charged to and paid from the special compensation fund provided by section 386-151.\n\n(g) In cases where the compensability of the claim is not contested by the employer, the medical services provider shall notify or bill the employer, insurer, or the special compensation fund for services rendered relating to the compensable injury within two years of the date services were rendered. Failure to bill the employer, insurer, or the special compensation fund within the two-year period shall result in the forfeiture of the medical services provider's right to payment. The medical [services] provider shall not directly charge the injured employee for treatments relating to the compensable injury.

The employee shall not be entitled to temporary total disability compensation for any week during this period where the wages equal or exceed the average weekly wages at the time of injury.\n\n(l) The director shall adopt rules for additional living expenses necessitated by the rehabilitation program, together with all reasonable and necessary vocational training.\n\n(m) If the rehabilitation unit determines that vocational rehabilitation is not possible or feasible, it shall certify the determination to the director.\n\n(n) Except as otherwise provided, determinations of the rehabilitation unit shall be final unless a written request for reconsideration is filed with the rehabilitation unit within ten calendar days of the date of the determination.\n\nThe rehabilitation unit shall issue a reconsideration determination to affirm, reverse, or modify the determination or refer the request for reconsideration for hearing.\n\n(o) A reconsideration determination shall be final unless a written request for hearing is filed within ten calendar days from the date of the reconsideration determination.

Where a work injury causes permanent total disability the employer shall pay the injured employee a weekly benefit equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wages, subject to the following limitation:\n\nBeginning January 1, 1975, and during each succeeding twelve-month period thereafter, not more than the state average weekly wage last determined by the director, rounded to the nearest dollar, nor less than $38 or twenty-five per cent of the foregoing maximum amount, rounded to the nearest dollar, whichever is higher.\n\nIn the case of the following injuries, the disability caused thereby shall be deemed permanent and total:\n\n(1) The permanent and total loss of sight in both eyes;\n\n(2) The loss of both feet at or before the ankle;\n\n(3) The loss of both hands at or above the wrist;\n\n(4) The loss of one hand and one foot;\n\n(5) An injury to the spine resulting in permanent and complete paralysis of both legs or both arms or one leg and one arm;\n\n(6) An injury to the skull resulting in incurable imbecility or insanity.\n\nIn all other cases the permanency and totality of the disability shall be determined on the facts. No adjudication of permanent total disability shall be made until after two weeks from the date of the injury.\n\n(b) Temporary total disability. Where a work injury causes total disability not determined to be permanent in character, the employer, for the duration of the disability, but not including the first three calendar days thereof, shall pay the injured employee a weekly benefit at the rate of sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wages, subject to the limitations on weekly benefit rates prescribed in subsection (a), or if the employee's average weekly wages are less than the minimum weekly benefit rate prescribed in subsection (a), at the rate of one hundred per cent of the employee's average weekly wages.\n\nIf an employee is unable to complete a regular daily work shift due to a work injury, the employee shall be deemed totally disabled for work for that day.\n\nThe employer shall pay temporary total disability benefits promptly as they accrue to the person entitled thereto without waiting for a decision from the director, unless this right is controverted by the employer in the employer's initial report of industrial injury. The first payment of benefits shall become due and shall be paid no later than on the tenth day after the employer has been notified of the occurrence of the total disability, and thereafter the benefits due shall be paid weekly except as otherwise authorized pursuant to section 386-53.\n\nThe payment of these benefits shall only be terminated upon order of the director or if the employee is able to resume work. When the employer is of the opinion that temporary total disability benefits should be terminated because the injured employee is able to resume work, the employer shall notify the employee and the director in writing of an intent to terminate the benefits at least two weeks prior to the date when the last payment is to be made. The notice shall give the reason for stopping payment and shall inform the employee that the employee may make a written request to the director for a hearing if the employee disagrees with the employer. Upon receipt of the request from the employee, the director shall conduct a hearing as expeditiously as possible and render a prompt decision as specified in section 386-86. If the employee is unable to perform light work, if offered, temporary total disability benefits shall not be discontinued based solely on the inability to perform or continue to perform light work.\n\nAn employer or insurance carrier who fails to comply with this section shall pay not more than $5,000 into the special compensation fund upon the order of the director, in addition to other penalties prescribed in section 386-92.\n\n(1) If the director determines, based upon a review of medical records and reports and other relevant documentary evidence, that an injured employee's medical condition may be stabilized and the employee is unable to return to the employee's regular job, the director shall issue a preliminary decision regarding the employee's entitlement and limitation to benefits and rights under Hawaii's workers' compensation laws. The preliminary decision shall be sent to the affected employee and the employee's designated representative and the employer and the employer's designated representative and shall state that any party disagreeing with the director's preliminary findings of medical stabilization and work limitations may request a hearing within twenty days of the date of the decision. The director shall be available to answer any questions during the twenty-day period from the injured employee and affected employer. If neither party requests a hearing challenging the director's finding the determination shall be deemed accepted and binding upon the parties. In any case where a hearing is held on the preliminary findings, any person aggrieved by the director's decision and order may appeal under section 386-87.\n\nA preliminary decision of the director shall inform the injured employee and the employer of the following responsibilities, benefits, and limitations on vocational rehabilitation benefits that are designed to facilitate the injured employee's early return to suitable gainful employment:\n\n(A) That the injured employee may invoke the employee's rights under section 378-2, 378-32, or 386-142, or all of them, in the event of unlawful discrimination or other unlawful employment practice by the employer; and\n\n(B) That after termination of temporary total disability benefits, an injured employee who resumes work may be entitled to permanent partial disability benefits, which if awarded, shall be paid regardless of the earnings or employment status of the disabled employee at the time.\n\n(2) If the rehabilitation unit determines that an injured employee is not a feasible candidate for rehabilitation and that the employee is unable to resume the employee's regular job, it shall promptly certify the same to the director. Soon thereafter, the director shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the injured employee remains temporarily totally disabled, or whether the employee is permanently partially disabled, or permanently totally disabled.

Where a work injury causes permanent partial disability, the employer shall pay the injured worker compensation in an amount determined by multiplying the effective maximum weekly benefit rate prescribed in section 386-31 by the number of weeks specified for the disability as follows:\n\nThumb. For the loss of thumb, seventy-five weeks;\n\nFirst finger. For the loss of a first finger, commonly called index finger, forty-six weeks;\n\nSecond finger. For the loss of a second finger, commonly called the middle finger, thirty weeks;\n\nThird finger. For the loss of a third finger, commonly called the ring finger, twenty-five weeks;\n\nFourth finger. For the loss of a fourth finger, commonly called the little finger, fifteen weeks;\n\nPhalanx of thumb or finger. Loss of the first phalanx of the thumb shall be equal to the loss of three-fourths of the thumb, and compensation shall be three-fourths of the amount above specified for the loss of the thumb. The loss of the first phalanx of any finger shall be equal to the loss of one-half of the finger, and compensation shall be one-half of the amount above specified for loss of the finger. The loss of more than one phalanx of the thumb or any finger shall be considered as loss of the entire thumb or finger;\n\nGreat toe. For the loss of a great toe, thirty-eight weeks;\n\nOther toes. For the loss of one of the toes other than the great toe, sixteen weeks;\n\nPhalanx of toe. Loss of the first phalanx of any toe shall be equal to the loss of one-half of the toe, and the compensation shall be one-half of the amount specified for the loss of the toe. The loss of more than one phalanx of any toe shall be considered as the loss of the entire toe;\n\nHand. For the loss of a hand, two hundred forty-four weeks;\n\nArm. For the loss of an arm, three hundred twelve weeks;\n\nFoot. For the loss of a foot, two hundred five weeks;\n\nLeg. For the loss of a leg, two hundred eighty-eight weeks;\n\nEye. For the loss of an eye by enucleation, one hundred sixty weeks. For the loss of vision in an eye, one hundred forty weeks. Loss of binocular vision or of eighty per cent of the vision of an eye shall be considered loss of vision of the eye;\n\nEar. For the permanent and complete loss of hearing in both ears, two hundred weeks. For the permanent and complete loss of hearing in one ear, fifty-two weeks. For the loss of both ears, eighty weeks. For the loss of one ear, forty weeks;\n\nLoss of use. Permanent loss of the use of a hand, arm, foot, leg, thumb, finger, toe, or phalanx shall be equal to and compensated as the loss of a hand, arm, foot, leg, thumb, finger, toe, or phalanx;\n\nPartial loss or loss of use of member named in schedule. Where a work injury causes permanent partial disability resulting from partial loss of use of a member named in this schedule, and where the disability is not otherwise compensated in this schedule, compensation shall be paid for a period that stands in the same proportion to the period specified for the total loss or loss of use of the member as the partial loss or loss of use of that member stands to the total loss or loss of use thereof;\n\nMore than one finger or toe of same hand or foot. In cases of permanent partial disability resulting from simultaneous injury to the thumb and one or more fingers of one hand, or to two or more fingers of one hand, or to the great toe and one or more toes other than the great toe of one foot, or to two or more toes other than the great toe of one foot, the disability may be rated as a partial loss or loss of use of the hand or the foot and the period of benefit payments shall be measured accordingly. In no case shall the compensation for loss or loss of use of more than one finger or toe of the same hand or foot exceed the amount provided in this schedule for the loss of a hand or foot;\n\nAmputation. Amputation between the elbow and the wrist shall be rated as the equivalent of the loss of a hand. Amputation between the knee and the ankle shall be rated as the equivalent of the loss of a foot. Amputation at or above the elbow shall be rated as the loss of an arm. Amputation at or above the knee shall be rated as the loss of a leg;\n\nDisfigurement. In cases of personal injury resulting in disfigurement the director may award compensation not to exceed $30,000 as the director deems proper and equitable in view of the disfigurement. Disfigurement shall be separate from other permanent partial disabilities and shall include scarring and other disfiguring consequences caused by medical, surgical, and hospital treatment of the employee;\n\nOther cases. In all other cases of permanent partial disability resulting from the loss or loss of use of a part of the body or from the impairment of any physical function, weekly benefits shall be paid at the rate and subject to the limitations specified in this subsection for a period that bears the same relation to a period named in the schedule as the disability sustained bears to a comparable disability named in the schedule. In cases in which the permanent partial disability must be rated as a percentage of the total loss or impairment of a physical or mental function of the whole person, the maximum compensation shall be computed on the basis of the corresponding percentage of the product of three hundred twelve times the effective maximum weekly benefit rate prescribed in section 386-31.\n\nPayment of compensation for permanent partial disability. Compensation for permanent partial disability shall be paid in weekly installments at the rate of sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the worker's average weekly wage, subject to the limitations on weekly benefit rates prescribed in section 386-31.\n\nUnconditional nature and time of commencement of payment. Compensation for permanent partial disability shall be paid regardless of the earnings of the disabled employee subsequent to the injury. Payments shall not commence until after termination of any temporary total disability that may be caused by the injury.\n\n(b) Temporary partial disability. Where a work injury causes partial disability, not determined to be permanent, which diminishes the employee's capacity for work, the employer, beginning with the first day of the disability and during the continuance thereof, shall pay the injured employee weekly benefits equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the difference between the employee's average weekly wages before the injury and the employee's weekly earnings thereafter, subject to the schedule for the maximum and minimum weekly benefit rates prescribed in section 386-31.\n\n(c) Provisions common to permanent and temporary partial disability. No determination of partial disability shall be made until two weeks from the date of the injury.

Where a work injury causes death, the employer shall pay funeral expenses not to exceed ten times the maximum weekly benefit rate to the mortician and burial expenses not to exceed five times the maximum weekly benefit rate to the cemetery selected by the family including a reciprocal beneficiary or next of kin of the deceased or in the absence of such family including a reciprocal beneficiary or next of kin, by the employer. Such payments shall be made directly to the mortician and cemetery; provided that when the deceased has a prepaid funeral and burial plan such payments for funeral and burial expenses, not to exceed the foregoing limits, shall be made directly to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary or the decedent's estate if there is no surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary.\n\n(b) Weekly benefits for dependents. In addition, the employer shall pay weekly benefits to the deceased's dependents at the percentages of the deceased's average weekly wages specified below, taking into account not more than the maximum weekly benefit rate prescribed in section 386-31 divided by .6667 and not less than the minimum prescribed in the section divided by .6667.\n\nTo the dependent widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary, if there are no dependent children, fifty per cent.\n\nTo the dependent widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary, if there are one or more dependent children of the deceased, sixty-six and two-thirds per cent. The compensation to the widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary shall be for the use and benefit of the widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary and of the dependent children, and the director of labor and industrial relations from time to time may apportion the compensation between them in such way as the director deems best.\n\nIf there is no dependent widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary, but a dependent child, then to the child forty per cent, and if there is more than one dependent child, then to the children in equal parts sixty-six and two-thirds per cent.\n\nIf there is no dependent widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary, or child, but there is a dependent parent, then to the parent, if wholly dependent fifty per cent, or if partially dependent twenty-five per cent; if both parents are dependent, then one-half of the foregoing compensation to each of them; if there is no dependent parent, but one or more dependent grandparents, then to each of them the same compensation as to a parent.\n\nIf there is no dependent widow, widower, or reciprocal beneficiary, child, parent or grandparent, but there is a dependent grandchild, brother, or sister, or two or more of them, then to those dependents thirty-five per cent for one dependent, increased by fifteen per cent for each additional dependent, to be divided equally among the dependents if more than one.\n\n(c) Maximum weekly amounts. The sum of all weekly benefits payable to the dependents of the deceased employee shall not exceed sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wages, computed by observing the limits specified in subsection (b), if necessary, the individual benefits shall be proportionally reduced.\n\n(d) Liability in the absence of dependents. If there be no dependents who are entitled to benefits under this section, the employer shall pay an amount equal to twenty-five per cent of three hundred and twelve times the effective maximum weekly benefit rate provided in section 386-31, to the nondependent parent or parents. If there be no such parent or parents, the employer shall pay the sum into the special compensation fund, pursuant to an order made by the director. The employer, pursuant to an order made by the director, shall pay any remaining balance into the special compensation fund, if the weekly benefits to which dependents are entitled terminate without totalling the amounts as calculated above.

Preliminary showing that injury occurred in course of employment not required. 63 H. 642, 636 P.2d 721 (1981).\n\nWhere labor and industrial relations appeals board failed expressly to acknowledge statutory presumption of compensability in its decision, issue deemed not to be whether board had explicitly referred to the presumption, but whether the presumption had been rebutted by substantial evidence; board €™s conclusion that claimant was not engaged in employment-related activity when claimant sustained injury was supported by substantial evidence. 77 H. 100, 881 P.2d 1246 (1994).\n\nStatutory presumption of paragraph (1) not triggered where claimant conceded that accident was not work-related. 77 H. 152, 883 P.2d 73 (1994).\n\nEmployee's disability was compensable under this chapter where labor appeals board failed to apply statutory presumption in favor of compensability of employee's claim under this section, and employers failed to demonstrate by substantial evidence that employee's disease (1) was not caused by conditions that are characteristic of or peculiar to employee's employment as a dental hygienist, (2) did not result from employee's actual exposure to such conditions, and (3) was not due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment in general. 94 H. 70, 9 P.3d 382 (2000).\n\nIn any proceeding on a claim for compensation due to an alleged compensable consequence of a work-related injury, this section creates a presumption in favor of the claimant that the subsequent injury is causally related to the primary injury. 94 H. 297, 12 P.3d 1238 (2000).\n\nWhere the paragraph (1) presumption of work-connectedness was neither applicable nor relevant to any issue on appeal, as a matter of law, the appellate court erred in applying the presumption to the issue in the case. 97 H. 86, 34 P.3d 16 (2001).\n\nAppellate court did not err in applying paragraph (1) presumptions where whether the cause of claimant's permanent disability was work-related or caused by prior injury and other personal and/or psychological stresses was clearly at issue in the proceedings. 97 H. 402, 38 P.3d 570 (2001).\n\nIn order to overcome the paragraph (1) presumption of work-relatedness, the employer must introduce substantial evidence to the contrary; once the trier of fact determines that the employer has adduced substantial evidence to overcome the presumption, it must weigh the evidence elicited by the employer against the evidence elicited by the claimant. 97 H. 402, 38 P.3d 570 (2001).\n\nAppeals board's decision denying employee's claim not clearly erroneous where employer adduced substantial evidence rebutting the presumption of compensability for employee's alleged stress-related workplace injury through psychiatrist's report that employee suffered from preexisting paranoid schizophrenia that was triggered by wage garnishment, which was not an incident of employment. 98 H. 263, 47 P.3d 730 (2002).\n\nDepartment of education failed to present substantial evidence to overcome the statutory presumption of compensability, where evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that employee's exposure to vog at work, combined with the surrounding circumstances of employee's employment and employee's preexisting condition, resulted in the exacerbation of employee's asthma. 131 H. 545, 319 P.3d 464 (2014).\n\nEmployer failed to present substantial evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that employee's shoulder injuries were related to a work accident where employer's physicians did not do more than opine generally that employee had injuries predating employee's employment and did not consider how employee's prior injuries might have been affected or aggravated by the work accident. 136 H. 448, 363 P.3d 296 (2015).\n\nState did not provide substantial evidence sufficient to rebut presumption of workers' compensation coverage for employee's knee injury where the only medical evidence the State presented was medical reports that were conclusory in nature, did not do more than opine generally that employee's injury predated the work incident, and did not provide any reasonable degree of specificity in explaining why the work incident did not cause or aggravate employee's injury. 137 H. 437, 375 P.3d 216 (2016).\n\nInjury or death arises in course of employment when it takes place within the period of employment, at place where the employee may reasonably be, and while fulfilling duties or engaged in something incidental thereto. 1 H. App. 77, 613 P.2d 927 (1980).\n\nPursuant to requirements of §91-12, appeals board should generally state whether or not it has applied presumption of paragraph (1). But failure to do so in instant case did not prejudice appellant's substantial rights. 1 H. App. 77, 613 P.2d 927 (1980).\n\nSubstantial evidence defined. 1 H. App. 77, 613 P.2d 927 (1980).\n\nScope and nature of presumption discussed. 3 H. App. 39, 640 P.2d 1175 (1982).\n\nBoard failed to correctly apply presumption of compensability; decision that claimant's low back condition was not a compensable consequence of a work injury was clearly erroneous in light of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the whole record. 94 H. 257 (App.), 12 P.3d 357 (2000).\n\nIn light of the strong presumption of work-relatedness under Hawaii workers' compensation law, as well as the lack of any non-speculative evidence to explain the cause of claimant's injuries from non-witnessed fall while claimant was performing employment duties at claimant's place of employment during working hours, employer failed to satisfy its heavy burden of adducing a \"high quantum\" of \"relevant and credible evidence of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify a conclusion by a reasonable person\" that claimant's fall and consequent injuries were not work-related. 101 H. 293 (App.), 67 P.3d 792 (2003).\n\nEmployer presented substantial evidence to rebut the presumption that employee's injuries were work-related where the undisputed evidence showed employee was injured while on unpaid leave, was injured while bowling, an activity that was not part of employee's work duties, at an off work site that was not operated or controlled by employer; employee's attendance there was strictly voluntary; employer did not finance the tournament; employer did not require employees to participate; and employer derived no substantial direct benefit from the bowling tournament beyond the intangible value of improvement in employee morale. 118 H. 239 (App.), 188 P.3d 753 (2008).\n\nWhere employee performed trail maintenance while carrying a thirty- to fifty-pound backpack and claimed work-related injury to knee, and medical doctor explained how injury to employee's knee could have been affected by work, employer did not present substantial evidence that injury was unrelated to employment. Medical evidence from employer consisted of generalized opinions when the primary focus of medical testimony should have been a discussion on whether the employment effort, whether great or little, in any way aggravated employee's condition. 137 H. 162 (App.), 366 P.3d 1041 (2016).\n\nMentioned: 52 H. 242, 473 P.2d 561 (1970); 4 H.

App. 543, 812 P.2d 1199 (1991).\n\nWhere there was no rational basis for board's refusing to consider additional evidence submitted by claimant, and no cogent explanation for board's failure to consider evidence in light of its direct effect on board's finding and conclusion, board abused its discretion in denying claimant's motion to reopen case. 93 H. 116 (App.), 997 P.2d 42 (2000).\n\nClaimant's appeal of director's decision was untimely where appeal was not filed for that decision within twenty-day deadline as required under subsection (a), notwithstanding that other issues were yet to be decided. 98 H. 508 (App.), 51 P.3d 375 (2002).\n\nAt the time plaintiff's appeals matured, where plaintiff was precluded by Hawaii administrative rule §12-15-94(d) from appealing the director's decisions to the labor and industrial relations appeals board, plaintiff could not be faulted for failing to file notices of appeal with the board within the twenty-day time limit as required by this section; thus, plaintiff was given twenty days from the effective date of this judgment to file appeals of the director's decisions with the board. 120 H. 101 (App.), 201 P.3d 614 (2009).\n\nSection 386-73 and this section set forth the right to appeal from the decisions of the director in workers' compensation cases and it gives a party the right to appeal the decision of the director in a medical fee dispute to the labor and industrial relations appeals board; thus, the no-appeal provision of Hawaii administrative rule §12-15-94(d) was invalid as inconsistent with this chapter, and the director exceeded the director's rulemaking authority in making the director's decisions in medical fee disputes final and non-appealable. 120 H. 101 (App.), 201 P.3d 614 (2009).\n\nPetitioner's September 7, 2010 appeal was timely, where petitioner's June 14, 2010 letter to the disability compensation division (DCD) objecting to the director's approval of petitioner's attorney's fees and requesting a hearing, followed by petitioner's subsequent letters, was an application to reopen the case pursuant to §386-89(a) to permit the introduction of newly discovered evidence and the DCD's August 30, 2010 letter was the director's final decision denying the application to reopen the case. 132 H. 320, 321 P.3d 671 (2014).\n\nWhere employee appealed the director of labor and industrial relations' (director) decision, which deferred determination of compensability on employee's workers' compensation claim until employee complied with the ordered independent medical examination, the labor and industrial relations appeals board (LIRAB) was required to exercise jurisdiction over the appeal because the LIRAB's failure to review the director's decision until entry of a final decision on employee's entitlement to benefits would deprive employee of adequate relief. 134 H. 99 (App.), 332 P.3d 701 (2014).\n\nThe labor and industrial relations appeals board (board) erred when it dismissed workers' compensation appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based upon the appellants' filing of an unsigned notice of appeal, where: (1) appellants' intent to appeal could be fairly inferred and was in fact acted upon by all parties and the board; and (2) the opposing party was not misled by the deficiency in the form of appellants' notice of appeal. 134 H. 103 (App.), 332 P.3d 705 (2014).\n\nWhere claimant filed a motion to reopen record and for reconsideration for the purpose of submitting an MRI report, the labor and industrial relations board abused its discretion when it denied the motion. Although the board has wide discretion in managing evidence, the equities of the case, and the overriding purpose of Hawaii's workers' compensation scheme, required the board to reopen the record and consider the MRI report. 137 H. 162 (App.), 366 P.3d 1041 (2016).\n\nCited: 27 H. 431, 433 (1923); 31 H. 672, 676 (1930); 31 H. 814, 815 (1931); 32 H. 699, 700 (1933); 32 H. 928 (1933); 37 H. 556 (1947); 37 H. 583 (1947); 39 H. 258 (1952).",
