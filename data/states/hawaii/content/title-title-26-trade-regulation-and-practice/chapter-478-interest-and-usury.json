Neither an agreement providing for an overdraft line of credit nor an agreement for a line of credit secured by equity in real property becomes a credit card agreement for the purposes of this chapter because a cardholder can access it through the use of a credit card.\n\n\"Finance charge\" has the same meaning given such term by the Truth in Lending Act.\n\n\"Home business loan\" means a credit transaction (1) in which the principal amount does not exceed $250,000 or in which there is an express written commitment to extend credit in a principal amount not exceeding $250,000; (2) which is not a consumer credit transaction; and (3) which is secured by a mortgage of the principal dwelling of any natural person who is a mortgagor named in the mortgage given as security in connection with the credit transaction.\n\n\"Real property\" includes stock in a cooperative housing corporation and personal property used or intended to be used as a consumer's residence.\n\n\"Truth in Lending Act\" means the federal Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.), Regulation Z of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Official Staff Commentary to Regulation Z prepared by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board, and amendments of the Act, Regulation Z, and such Commentary.
