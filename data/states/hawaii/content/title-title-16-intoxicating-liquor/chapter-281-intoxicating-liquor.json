A transfer of license shall be for the same class, kind, and category of license. No license issued under this chapter shall be transferable or be transferred except upon written application to the commission by the proposed transferee, and after prior inspection of the premises, reference to, and report by an inspector, and a public hearing held by the commission not less than fourteen days after one publication of notice thereof, but without sending notice of the hearing by mail to persons being the owners or lessees of real estate situated within the vicinity of the premises and without the right to the owners or lessees to protest the transfer of a license. Exceptions are class 5 and 11 licensees who shall comply with the requirements as set forth in sections 281-57 to 281-60. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, a class 2 license shall be transferrable; provided that the transferee certifies that the transferee intends to and shall derive no less than thirty per cent of the establishment's gross revenue from the sale of foods.\n\n(b) A county may increase the requirements for transfers of class 5, category (1)(B) and (D), and class 11 licenses by ordinance designating one or more areas within the county as special liquor districts and specifying the requirements applicable to transfers of any of these licenses within each district.\n\n(c) For the purpose of this section, \"special liquor district\" means an area designated by a county for restoration, reservation, historic preservation, redevelopment, rejuvenation, or residential protection, in which development is guided to protect or enhance the physical and visual aspects of the area for the benefit of the community as a whole.\n\n(d) Where a license is held by a partnership, the commission may, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, approve the transfer of the partnership interest, without publication of notice at a public hearing, to any remaining partner or partners, upon the death or withdrawal of a partner of the partnership, or to a trust of which the partner is the trustee.\n\n(e) Where a license is held by a partnership, limited partnership, or limited liability partnership, the admission or withdrawal of a partner, limited partner, or partner of a limited liability partnership shall not be deemed a transfer of the license; provided that the licensee shall, within thirty days from the date of the admission or withdrawal, so notify the commission in writing, stating the name of the partner, limited partner, or partner of a limited liability partnership who has been admitted or withdrawn, and any other information as may be required by the commission. If the commission finds that the partner or limited partner for whom notification is required as specified in this subsection does not meet statutory requirements to hold a license in the partner's or limited partner's own right pursuant to section 281-45, it may, in its discretion, revoke the license or suspend the license until the partner or limited partner is removed or replaced by a partner or limited partner who meets the statutory requirements to hold a license pursuant to section 281-45.\n\n(f) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the same procedure shall be followed in regard to the transfer of a license as is prescribed by this chapter for obtaining a license. Sections 281-51 to 281-60, except where inconsistent with this section, are applicable to the transfers. The word \"applicant\", as used in sections 281-51 to 281-60, shall include each proposed transferee, and the words, \"application for a license or for the renewal of a license\", as used in those sections, shall include an application for the transfer of a license.\n\n(g) Upon the hearing, the commission shall consider the application and any objections to the granting thereof and hear the parties in interest. It shall inquire into the propriety of each transfer and determine whether the proposed transferee is a fit person to hold the license. It may approve a transfer or refuse to approve a transfer and the refusal by the commission to approve a transfer shall be final and conclusive, unless an appeal is taken as provided in chapter 91.\n\n(h) If any licensee without prior approval, approval of a temporary license, or approval of a management agreement transfers to any other person the licensee's business for which the licensee's license was issued, either openly or under any undisclosed arrangement, whereby any person, other than the licensee, comes into exclusive possession or control of the business or takes in any partner or associate who would not meet statutory requirements to hold a license pursuant to section 281-45, the commission may in its discretion suspend or cancel the license. For purposes of this subsection, \"management agreement\" means a written agreement under which a licensee allows a manager to manage and operate the licensee's business on behalf of the licensee.\n\n(i) If the licensee is a corporation or limited liability company, a change in ownership of any outstanding capital stock or membership interest shall not be deemed a transfer of a license; provided that, in the case of a change in ownership of twenty-five per cent or more of the voting capital stock or membership interest or in the case of change in ownership of any number of shares of the stock or membership interest that results in the transferee thereof becoming the owner of twenty-five per cent or more of the outstanding voting capital stock or membership interest, the corporate or limited liability company licensee shall, within thirty days of the date of the transfer, apply for the approval of the transfer from the commission in writing. If the commission finds that the transferee does not meet statutory requirements to hold a license in the transferee's own right pursuant to section 281-45, it shall not approve the transfer. If any transfer is made without the approval of the commission, the commission may in its discretion revoke or suspend the license until it determines that the transferee meets the statutory requirements to hold a license, and if the commission finds that the transferee does not meet the statutory requirements to hold a license, until a retransfer or new transfer of the capital stock or membership interest is made to a person who meets the statutory requirements to hold a license pursuant to section 281-45. In addition, the corporate or limited liability company licensee, if not a publicly-traded company, or an entity ultimately solely owned by a publicly-traded company, shall, within thirty days from the date of election or admission of any officer, director, manager, or member, notify the commission in writing of the name, age, and place of residence of the officer, director, manager, or member, and any other information as may be required by the commission. A publicly-traded corporation or limited liability company, or a corporation or limited liability company ultimately solely owned by a publicly-traded company, shall, within thirty days from the date of election or admission of any replacement of an officer, director, manager, or member designated as a primary decision-maker regarding the purchase and sale of liquor, notify the commission in writing of the name, age, and place of residence of the officer, director, manager, or member. If the commission finds that the officer, director, manager, or member for whom notification is required to be given as specified in this subsection, does not meet statutory requirements to hold a license in the officer's, director's, manager's, or member's own right pursuant to section 281-45, it may in its discretion revoke the license or suspend the license until the officer, director, manager, or member is removed or replaced by a person who meets statutory requirements to hold a license pursuant to section 281-45.\n\n(j) If a licensee closes out the business for which the license is held, during the term for which the license was issued, the licensee shall, within five days from the date of closing the same, give the commission written notice thereof and surrender the licensee's license for cancellation, unless the licensee obtains prior approval from the commission to place its license with the commission for safekeeping. For the purposes of this subsection, \"safekeeping\" means the holding of a liquor license at the commission office while the licensee is not operating.\n\n(k) The conversion of an entity into any other form of entity or the merger of any entity with any other entity shall not be deemed a transfer of the license; provided that the licensee, within thirty days of the conversion or merger, shall apply for and secure the approval of the commission without any requirement for publication of notice. The foregoing shall not preclude compliance with subsection (e) upon a change in any of the partners or with subsection (i) upon change of any shareholders, officers, directors, managers, or members of any entity occurring concurrently with a conversion or merger.\n\nAs used in this subsection, \"entity\" means a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability company.\n\n(l) Any officer, director, partner, limited partner, manager, or member not designated as a primary decision-maker shall be prohibited from coercing, pressuring, or otherwise unduly influencing the decision of a designated primary decision-maker to engage in any unlawful activity relating to the purchase and sale of liquor. If the commission finds that coercion, pressure, or other undue influence has been placed on a primary decision-maker by any officer, director, manager, or member who is not a designated primary decision-maker, the commission may in its discretion suspend or cancel the license.

Notice by mail may be addressed to the last known address of the person concerned or to the address as shown in the current real property tax record of the person or the person's agent or representative;\n\n(2) In counties with a population of five hundred thousand or more, not less than two-thirds of the registered voters residing within, and small businesses situated within, a distance of five hundred feet from the nearest point of the premises for which the license is asked; provided that in meeting this requirement, the applicant shall mail notices to not less than three-fourths of the registered voters residing within, and small businesses situated within, a distance of one hundred feet from the nearest point of the premises for which the license is asked. This paragraph shall not apply to applications for class 2, class 4, class 12, and class 15 licenses. A notice sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be addressed to the \"occupant\" of the residential unit or small business; and\n\n(3) For each condominium project and cooperative apartment within the five hundred-foot area, one notice of the hearing shall be sent by mail addressed \"To the Residents, Care of the Manager\", followed by the name and address of the condominium or cooperative apartment involved.\n\nThe notices required under this subsection shall be mailed at least forty-five days prior to the date set for the hearing. No promotional information shall be allowed on, or accompany the notice. Before the hearing, and within seven business days of having mailed the notices, the applicant shall file with the commission an affidavit that the notices have been mailed in compliance with this subsection. In addition to the affidavit (which shall be made available within the same seven-business-day period with proof of having mailed the notices), the applicant shall include both a master list of one hundred per cent of addressees and addresses required by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), and another mailing list consisting of the portion of addressees and their respective addresses who were mailed the notice purposely needed to meet the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3). The affidavit, master list, and mailing list shall be made available within seven business days (of the mailing of the notice by the applicant) by the commission for public review upon request. For purposes of this section, \"master list\" means every owner and lessee who would otherwise be required to receive notice of the public hearing according to the requirement of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), even if they were not actually included in the two-third or three-fourths requirement (as the case may be) of paragraph (1) or (2), and every condominium project and cooperative apartment qualifying in paragraph (3). When the requirements of this section have not been met, the commission may cancel the hearing or continue the public hearing subject to the provisions of this section.\n\n(d) For purposes of this section, notice to one co-owner and one co-lessee of real estate shall be sufficient notice to all co-owners and all co-lessees of that real estate; and one notice is sufficient to an owner or lessee of multiple parcels; except that one notice shall be sent to each individual unit of a cooperative apartment as provided in this section.

A protest submitted by the majority of the co-owners or the majority of the co-lessees of a property shall constitute a protest by all the owners or lessees of record of that property. A protest filed by owners or lessees who own more than one property shall be counted for each property.\n\n(b) The liquor commission shall make available to the applicant and any protester for review before the public hearing, the protest list of those persons who filed a protest or objection to the application; provided that the applicant shall not use the protest list to attempt to influence in any way any protester to withdraw the protest or objection. All applicants and protesters may submit corrections, additions, and subtractions to the master list and the protest list at the public hearing; provided that additions or corrections to the voter registration list shall be certified by the clerk of the county. The liquor commission shall rule on proposed corrections, additions, and subtractions and give reasons for the ruling.\n\n(c) The commission may also, with like discretion:\n\n(1) Grant a license to one person in preference to another, without reference to any priority in the order of filing of the applications; and\n\n(2) Of its own motion, or on the suggestion of any member, or of the investigator take notice of any matter or thing which in the opinion of a majority of its members would be a sufficient objection to the granting of a license; but in such case if the objection is one to which the applicant should be given a reasonable time to answer, a continuance may be granted in the discretion of the commission;\n\nprovided that in any case where any person affected by such decision petitions the commission for a rehearing of the application and on oath alleges facts and grounds for consideration which were not formerly presented or considered, or any other matter of fact which in the judgment of the commission seems sufficient to warrant a rehearing, such rehearing may be granted by the commission in its discretion upon the publication of notice of rehearing at least seven days before the date of the rehearing.
