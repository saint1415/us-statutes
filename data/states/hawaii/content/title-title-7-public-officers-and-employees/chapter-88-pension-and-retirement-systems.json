Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code requires that the \"entire interest\" of a member be distributed or that distribution of the member's benefits begin no later than the member's \"required beginning date\".\n\n(b) For the purposes of this section, \"required beginning date\" means April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which a member terminates service or attains age seventy and one-half, whichever is later.\n\n(c) A member or former member's accumulated contributions or hypothetical account balance, as defined in section 88-311, shall be paid to the member or former member, or payment of the benefits payable under part II, VII, or VIII of this chapter shall commence, no later than the member's or former member's required beginning date. The payment or payments shall be made on, or beginning no later than, the member's or former member's required beginning date even if the member or former member does not apply for payment or file a retirement application.\n\n(d) If, by a member's or former member's required beginning date:\n\n(1) The member or former member's accumulated contributions or hypothetical account balance, as defined in section 88-311, are not paid to the member or former member; or\n\n(2) Payment of the benefits payable under part II, VII, or VIII of this chapter do not commence,\n\nthe system shall pay the service retirement benefits for which the member or former member is eligible pursuant to part II, VII, or VIII of this chapter, as applicable, retroactive to the member's or former member's required beginning date with regular interest.\n\n(e) If the system does not receive a written election from the member or former member under section 88-83, 88-283, or 88-333, as applicable, prior to the later of the member's or former member's required beginning date or sixty days following the receipt by the member or former member of notice from the system that the member or former member is required to make an election, the following election shall be deemed to have been made as of the member or former member's required beginning date:\n\n(1) If the member or former member is unmarried or has no reciprocal beneficiary, the member or former member shall be deemed to have elected the maximum retirement allowance; or\n\n(2) If the member or former member is married or has a reciprocal beneficiary, the member or former member shall be deemed to have elected option 3 under section 88-83, or option A under section 88-283, as applicable, and to have designated the member's or former member's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary as the member's or former member's beneficiary;\n\nprovided that if the system receives the written election after the member's or former member's required beginning date, but within sixty days following receipt by the member or former member of notice from the system that the member or former member is required to make the election, the written election shall apply, and the member's or former member's retirement benefit shall be recomputed, based on the written election, retroactive to the member or former member's required beginning date. The amount of any underpayment resulting from recomputing the benefit shall bear regular interest. If recomputing the benefit results in an overpayment, payments shall be adjusted so that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member or former member was correctly entitled shall be paid.\n\n(f) If the system does not have current information about the member's or former member's marital or reciprocal beneficiary status at the time of a deemed election, the following presumptions shall apply:\n\n(1) If the member or former member was married or had a reciprocal beneficiary at the time the member or former member last provided information to the system about the member's or former member's marital or reciprocal beneficiary status, it shall be presumed that the member or former member is still married to the same spouse or is in the same reciprocal beneficiary relationship. If the system does not have information as to the age of the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary shall be presumed to be forty years younger than the member or former member for purposes of computing the member's or former member's benefit; and\n\n(2) If the member or former member was unmarried and did not have a reciprocal beneficiary at the time the member or former member last provided information to the system about the member or former member's marital status, it shall be presumed that the member or former member is married and that the spouse of the member or former member is forty years younger than the member or former member.\n\n(g) The presumptions in subsection (f) shall cease to apply when the member or former member provides the system with current information as to the member's or former member's marital or reciprocal beneficiary status and the age of the member or former member's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, if any, on the member's or former member's required beginning date. The information shall be provided in a form satisfactory to the system. At that time, the member's or former member's retirement allowance shall be recomputed, retroactive to the member's or former member's required beginning date, based on the updated information; provided that, except as provided in subsection (e), the member or former member shall not be permitted to change the member's or former member's retirement allowance option election or beneficiary; provided further that the benefit being paid to any member or former member who, on the member's or former member's required beginning date, was unmarried and did not have a reciprocal beneficiary, but who was deemed to elect option 3 or option A with an assumed spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, shall be converted to the maximum retirement allowance retroactive to the member's or former member's required beginning date. The amount of any underpayment resulting from recomputing the benefit shall bear regular interest. If recomputing the benefit results in an overpayment, payments shall be adjusted so that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member or former member was correctly entitled shall be paid.\n\n(h) If the system cannot locate the member or former member, the member's or former member's benefit shall be payable only until the end of the member's or former member's life expectancy, as determined at the member's or former member's required beginning date. If the member or former member has not by that time made a claim for benefits, the member or former member shall be deemed to be deceased at that time. Interest under subsection (d) shall cease on benefits presumed to be abandoned property, pursuant to part I of chapter 523A, upon payment of the property to the administrator under part I of chapter 523A.\n\n(i) Rules necessary for the purposes of this section shall be adopted as provided in section 88-22.5.

Op. 85-10.\n\nIn general, the calculation of retirement benefits of elective officers who were elective officers on July 1, 1997, pursuant to Act 374, Session Laws of Hawaii 1997, should be made thus: the law as it existed before the effective date of Act 374 (July 1, 1997) is applied to service accrued before the effective date of the Act (i.e., elective officers can apply a high average final compensation to years of possibly multiple types of services, including elective service) and the amount derived from that calculation is added to the amount arrived at by applying the Act to service accrued after the effective date of the Act (which is segregated by service category). This results in using different average final compensations for pre- and post-Act service. Att. Gen. Op. 2000-1.",

At the member's retirement, there shall be established an amount of initial insurance that shall be computed on the basis of actuarial factors adopted by the board. Upon the death of the retirant, there shall be paid to the retirant's designated beneficiary, otherwise to the retirant's estate: any balance remaining in the initial insurance reserve, after deducting the retirement allowance and, if the retirant retired after November 30, 2004, the post retirement allowances paid to the retirant prior to death. In lieu of the lump sum balance, the beneficiary may, if the beneficiary is a natural person, elect to receive an allowance for life based on the value of the balance; provided that the allowance is not less than $100 per month.

If the beneficiary dies prior to the retirant, all further payments shall cease upon the death of the retirant; provided that for members retiring after November 30, 2004, if the retirant's designated beneficiary dies at any time after the retirant retired, but before the death of the retirant, the retirant, upon the death of the retirant's designated beneficiary, shall receive a retirement allowance, including cumulative post retirement allowances, calculated as if the retirant had selected the maximum retirement allowance to which the retirant is entitled. Only one beneficiary shall be designated under this option. The beneficiary designated under this option shall be a natural person, and benefits under this option shall only be paid to a natural person.\n\nOption 3: The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and have one-half of the allowance, including fifty per cent of all cumulative post retirement allowances, if applicable, continued after the member's death to the member's beneficiary designated at the time of the member's retirement, for the life of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies prior to the retirant, all further payments shall cease upon the death of the retirant; provided that for members retiring after November 30, 2004, if the retirant's designated beneficiary dies at any time after the retirant retired, but before the death of the retirant, the retirant, upon the death of the retirant's designated beneficiary, shall receive a retirement allowance, including cumulative post retirement allowances, calculated as if the retirant had selected the maximum retirement allowance to which the retirant is entitled.

Upon the death of the retirant, all further payments shall cease. Only a member retiring from service having at least ten years of credited service or for disability may elect this retirement allowance option.\n\nTo receive benefits, the beneficiary must have been designated by the member in the form and manner prescribed by the board.\n\n(b) In the event of the death of a member after the date of the filing of the member's written application to retire but prior to the retirement date designated by the member, and, if the member was eligible to retire on the date of the member's death, the member's designated beneficiary, or otherwise the personal representative of the member's estate, may elect to receive either the death benefit under section 88-84 or the allowance under the option selected by the member that would have been payable had the member retired.

If death benefits are payable under section 88-85, the death benefits shall be in lieu of any benefits payable pursuant to this section.\n\n(c) No election by a member under this section shall take effect unless:\n\n(1) The spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of the member is furnished written notification that:\n\n(A) Specifies the retirement date, the benefit option selected, and the beneficiary designated by the member;\n\n(B) Provides information indicating the effect of the election; and\n\n(C) Is determined adequate by rules adopted by the board in accordance with chapter 91;\n\n(2) The member selects option 2 or option 3 and designates the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary as the beneficiary; or\n\n(3) It is established to the satisfaction of the board that the notice required under paragraph (1) cannot be provided because:\n\n(A) There is no spouse or reciprocal beneficiary;\n\n(B) The spouse or reciprocal beneficiary cannot be located;\n\n(C) The member has failed to notify the system that the member has a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, or has failed to provide the system with the name and address of the member's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary; or\n\n(D) Of other reasons, as established by board rules adopted in accordance with chapter 91.\n\nAny notice provided to a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, or determination that the notification of a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary cannot be provided, shall be effective only with respect to that spouse or reciprocal beneficiary.

The retirant shall notify the system in writing and provide a certified copy of the beneficiary's death certificate. The system shall make retroactive benefit payments to the retirant, not to exceed six months from the date the written notification and the certified copy of the death certificate are received by the system. The retroactive payments shall be without interest.\n\n(h) Upon a member's retirement:\n\n(1) The member's election of a retirement allowance option shall be irrevocable; and\n\n(2) The member's designation of a beneficiary shall be irrevocable if the retirement allowance option elected by the member is:\n\n(A) Option 2 or 3;\n\n(B) An option that includes option 2 or 3 in combination with some other form of benefit payment; or\n\n(C) Any other option for which the actuarial equivalent of the option to the maximum retirement allowance is determined at the time of the member's retirement based in whole or in part on the age of the member's designated beneficiary.\n\n(i) A claim under this section by a retirant's or member's beneficiary for benefits upon the death of a retirant or member shall be filed no later than three years from the date of the retirant's or member's death.

and\n\n(4) That the order applies to the system.\n\n(c) If, pursuant to a Hawaii domestic relations order, an alternate payee is receiving all or a portion of a retirant's pension, annuity, or retirement allowance, the alternate payee shall be entitled to receive a post retirement allowance as provided by section 88-90.\n\n(d) A Hawaii domestic relations order shall not:\n\n(1) Purport to require the designation by the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant of a particular person as the recipient of benefits upon the death of the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant;\n\n(2) Purport to require the selection of a particular benefit payment plan or option or to limit the benefit payment plans or options from which the member or former member with vested benefit status may select;\n\n(3) Require any action on the part of the system contrary to its governing laws or plan provisions other than the direct payment of the benefit awarded to an alternate payee;\n\n(4) Make the award to the alternate payee an interest that is contingent on any condition other than those conditions resulting in the liability of the system for payment under its plan provisions;\n\n(5) Purport to give to someone other than a member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant the right to designate a beneficiary or to choose any retirement plan or option available from the system;\n\n(6) Attach a lien to any part of amounts payable with respect to a member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant;\n\n(7) Award an alternate payee a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant under the system and purport to require the system to make a lump sum payment of the awarded portion of the benefits to the alternate payee that are not payable in a lump sum;\n\n(8) Purport to require the system, without action by the member, to terminate a member from membership or employment, to refund contributions, or to retire a member or former member with vested benefit status;\n\n(9) Provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided by the system;\n\n(10) Provide increased benefits, determined on the basis of actuarial value; or\n\n(11) Require the system to provide benefits or refunds to an alternate payee that are required to be paid to another alternate payee pursuant to an earlier Hawaii domestic relations order.\n\n(e) Upon receipt of a copy of the complaint for divorce, certified by the clerk of the court in which the complaint was filed, or a copy of the divorce decree certified by the clerk of the court in which the divorce decree was filed, and a written request that identifies the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant by name and social security number and states the date of the marriage, the system shall provide the spouse or former spouse of a member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant with the same information that would be provided to the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant on the member's, former member's with vested benefit status, or retirant's benefits that is relevant to the spouse's or former spouse's interest in the member's, former member's with vested benefit status, or retirant's benefits.\n\n(f) A person who wishes to have the system review a domestic relations order or a proposed domestic relations order to establish whether the order or proposed order meets the requirements for a Hawaii domestic relations order shall submit to the system a written request for review and a copy of the order or proposed order. If the order has been entered by a court, the copy of the order shall be certified by the clerk of the court that entered the order. The order or proposed order shall be reviewed as provided by this section.\n\nThe filing fee in effect at the time that an order or proposed order is submitted shall be paid before the order or proposed order is processed or reviewed. In addition, the system shall charge for legal and actuarial services as provided by subsection (s).\n\nBefore any legal or actuarial services are performed, the system shall notify the person who requested the review of the order or proposed order that the services will be needed as part of the review. The notification shall include an estimate of the extent of the services and the estimated costs relating to those services. The charges for legal and actuarial services shall be paid before the system may issue notification of determination on an order or notification whether or not a proposed order meets the requirements for a Hawaii domestic relations order.\n\nIf a domestic relations order is submitted for review after it has been entered by the court and is thereafter amended with the intention that it shall be a Hawaii domestic relations order, the member, former member with vested benefit status, retirant, or the alternate payee shall submit a certified copy of the amended order to the system. The system shall review any amended order that it receives according to the same rules applicable to all other orders.\n\n(g) The system shall review an order or proposed order for compliance with the requirements imposed by this section. Upon completion of the review:\n\n(1) The system shall not issue a determination that a proposed order is or is not a Hawaii domestic relations order but shall notify the person who submitted the proposed order, in writing, whether the proposed order meets the requirements for a Hawaii domestic relations order, identifying any provisions of this section that the proposed order does not meet. The notification may also be provided to the member, former member with vested benefit status, retirant, or alternate payee. The system's notification is advisory, and shall not constitute a determination that a proposed domestic relations order is or is not a Hawaii domestic relations order; and\n\n(2) If the order has been entered by the court, the system shall notify the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant and the alternate payee in writing of the determination that the domestic relations order is or is not a Hawaii domestic relations order, identifying any provisions of this section that the order does not meet.\n\n(h) During any period not exceeding eighteen months, beginning on the date on which the first payment would be required to be made to the alternate payee under the domestic relations order, in which a domestic relations order is under review to determine whether it is a Hawaii domestic relations order, or in which a determination that an order is not qualified is on appeal to the board or to a court, the system shall limit the member's, former member's with vested benefit status, or retirant's rights in the member's, former member's with vested benefit status, or retirant's benefits to the extent the system deems appropriate to protect the largest amount that would be payable to the proposed alternate payee under the system's interpretation of the domestic relations order. Any amounts not paid to the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant during this eighteen-month period shall be separately accounted for. If the domestic relations order is determined to be a Hawaii domestic relations order before the end of the eighteen-month period, the system shall pay benefits to the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant and the alternate payee in accordance with the Hawaii domestic relations order and the terms of the plan, including any benefits separately accounted for during the period between the date on which the first payment was to be made under the Hawaii domestic relations order and the date the determination is made. If the domestic relations order is finally determined not to be a Hawaii domestic relations order, or if the eighteen-month period expires without a determination that the domestic relations order is a Hawaii domestic relations order, none of the amounts separately accounted for shall be paid to the alternate payee, and the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant shall be entitled to the member's, former member's with vested benefit status, or retirant's full benefits in accordance with the terms of this chapter, including any benefits that had been separately accounted for and withheld from the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant. If the domestic relations order is determined to be a Hawaii domestic relations order after the end of the eighteen-month period, or if the system later receives another domestic relations order that is determined to be a Hawaii domestic relations order, the Hawaii domestic relations order shall apply prospectively only and shall not affect benefits already paid to the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant.\n\n(i) Subject to the limitations of applicable statutes and this section, if a domestic relations order is determined to be a Hawaii domestic relations order, the system shall pay benefits in accordance with the order at the time benefits become payable to, or in the case of contributions or hypothetical account balances, are withdrawn by, the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant. Any determination that an order is a Hawaii domestic relations order is voidable or subject to modification if the system determines that the provisions of the order have been changed or that circumstances relevant to the determination have changed.\n\n(j) If a member or former member with vested benefit status terminates membership in the system by withdrawal of contributions or hypothetical account balance, the system shall pay all or a portion of the amount withdrawn to any alternate payee as directed by a Hawaii domestic relations order. Payment to any alternate payee pursuant to this subsection shall be in a lump sum. If after terminating membership in the system by withdrawal of contributions or hypothetical account balance, the former member later resumes membership in the system, the system shall pay to an alternate payee no portion of any benefits that result from the resumption of membership, even if those benefits result in part from reinstatement of service credit initially credited during the marriage.\n\n(k) In order to receive credit for all service represented by withdrawn or refunded contributions, a member, in reinstating service credit by repaying amounts previously withdrawn or refunded, shall repay the entire amount withdrawn or refunded, regardless of whether a portion or all of the amount was paid to an alternate payee.\n\n(l) When the system has not yet begun to make payment to an alternate payee under this section and is provided with proof of the death of the alternate payee, benefits payable with respect to the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant shall be paid without regard to the Hawaii domestic relations order.\n\n(m) When the system receives a certified copy of a domestic relations order prior to a member's retirement, and if the domestic relations order is determined to be a Hawaii domestic relations order, the system, except as provided in subsection (j), shall pay the alternate payee a portion of the retirement benefit the member or former member with vested benefit status is expected to receive as follows:\n\n(1) If the alternate payee will be named beneficiary under any option elected by the retirant at retirement, the benefit to which the retirant is entitled, without regard to the Hawaii domestic relations order, shall be apportioned between the retirant and the alternate payee according to the terms of the Hawaii domestic relations order. Upon the death of the retirant or the alternate payee, the benefit amount to be paid to the survivor shall be the amount required under the option elected by the retirant at retirement, as though no Hawaii domestic relations order had existed; or\n\n(2) If the alternate payee will not be a named beneficiary under the option elected by the retirant at retirement, the benefit to which the retirant is entitled without regard to the Hawaii domestic relations order, shall be apportioned between the retirant and the alternate payee according to the terms of the Hawaii domestic relations order. If the retirant predeceases the alternate payee, payments to the alternate payee shall cease and payments to the retirant's named beneficiary or beneficiaries shall be made as required under the option elected by the retirant at retirement, as though no Hawaii domestic relations order had existed. If the alternate payee predeceases the retirant, the benefit then being paid to the retirant shall be increased by the amount of the benefit that was being paid to the alternate payee at time of death.\n\nPayment of the alternate payee's interest under this subsection shall be effective as of the same date that benefit payments are effective for the member.\n\n(n) When the system receives a certified copy of a domestic relations order subsequent to the member's or former member's with vested benefit status retirement, and if the domestic relations order is determined to be a Hawaii domestic relations order, the interest awarded to the alternate payee by the Hawaii domestic relations order shall be paid as a portion of the retirement benefit the retirant is receiving as follows:\n\n(1) If the alternate payee is already a named beneficiary under any option elected by the retirant at retirement, the benefit to which the retirant is entitled, without regard to the Hawaii domestic relations order, shall be apportioned between the retirant and the alternate payee according to the terms of the Hawaii domestic relations order. Upon the death of the retirant or the alternate payee, the benefit amount to be paid to the survivor shall be the amount required under the option elected by the retirant at retirement, as though no Hawaii domestic relations order had existed; or\n\n(2) If the alternate payee is not a named beneficiary under the option elected by the retirant at retirement, the benefit to which the retirant is entitled without regard to the Hawaii domestic relations order, shall be apportioned between the retirant and the alternate payee according to the terms of the Hawaii domestic relations order. If the retirant predeceases the alternate payee, payments to the alternate payee shall cease and payments to the retirant's named beneficiary or beneficiaries shall be made as required under the option elected by the retirant at retirement, as though no Hawaii domestic relations order had existed. If the alternate payee predeceases the retirant, the benefit then being paid to the retirant shall be increased by the amount of the benefit that was being paid to the alternate payee at time of death.\n\nPayment according to the terms of the Hawaii domestic relations order under this subsection shall commence as of the first day of the month following the date upon which the order is determined to be qualified, unless the parties jointly direct that payment shall commence at a later date.\n\n(o) If a retirant returns to employment requiring active membership in the system:\n\n(1) Payments to an alternate payee pursuant to a Hawaii domestic relations order shall not be suspended; and\n\n(2) The system shall pay to an alternate payee no portion of any benefits payable to the retirant that result from the resumption of membership.\n\n(p) For the purpose of calculating earnings limitations for retirants who have been restored to service, the retirant's maximum retirement allowance shall be considered to be the amount that would have been paid if there had not been any Hawaii domestic relations order applicable to the retirant.\n\n(q) A court does not have jurisdiction over the system with respect to a divorce or other domestic relations action in which an alternate payee's right to receive all or a portion of the benefits payable to a member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant is created or established. A determination by the system that a domestic relations order is not a Hawaii domestic relations order shall be subject to review as provided in chapter 91 and the system's rules relating to contested cases. The system shall not be made party to any other judicial proceedings except as provided in this subsection. A party to any action who attempts to make the system a party to the action contrary to this subsection shall be liable to the system for the system's costs and attorney's fees in the action, including attorneys' fee and costs for obtaining a dismissal.\n\n(r) If a member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant, or the beneficiary or estate of any, receives the amount of any distribution that should have been paid by the system to the spouse or former spouse of the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant, the recipient shall be designated a constructive trustee for the amount received and shall immediately transmit that amount to the person to whom the amount should have been paid. If a spouse or former spouse of a member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant, or the estate, heirs, or legatees of the spouse or former spouse receive any amount of a distribution that should have been paid to a member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant, or the estate, heirs, or legatees of any, the recipient shall be designated a constructive trustee for the amount received and shall immediately transmit that amount to the member, former member with vested benefit status, or retirant or other person to whom the amount should have been paid. If a member, former member with vested benefit status, retirant, or the beneficiary, estate, heirs, or legatees of any, receives any amount that should not have been paid by the system, the recipient shall be designated a constructive trustee for the amount received and shall immediately transmit that amount to the system. If an alternate payee or the estate, heirs, or legatee of the alternate payee, receives any amount that should not have been paid by the system, the recipient shall be designated a constructive trustee for the amount received and shall immediately transmit that amount to the system.\n\n(s) The board shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 91, and adopt forms as it deems necessary to effectuate this section. The board, by motion at a duly noticed meeting of the board, may establish and revise from time to time:\n\n(1) A filing fee for processing and review of domestic relations orders and proposed domestic relations orders for the purposes of this section;\n\n(2) A schedule of charges for legal and actuarial services incurred by the system in the review and processing of domestic relations orders and proposed Hawaii domestic relations orders for the purposes of this section; and\n\n(3) A required form or forms for Hawaii domestic relations orders.\n\n(t) Payments made to alternate payees according to the terms of Hawaii domestic relations orders are payments received by the retirant for purposes of sections 88-83(f) and 88-333(c), and the benefit that the retirant received for purposes of section 88-283(g).\n\n(u) The priority of Hawaii domestic relations orders shall be determined by the order in which the certified copies of domestic relations orders are received by the system for qualification as a Hawaii domestic relations order, and not by the order in which domestic relations orders are determined to be Hawaii domestic relations orders, the order in which the domestic relations orders are entered by the court, the date the complaint for divorce is filed, the date upon which an order of divorce is entered, or the date of marriage.

For example, if a retirant's maximum retirement allowance upon the retirant's initial retirement was limited by section 88-74 to eighty per cent of the retirant's average final compensation, and the retirant retired with a maximum allowance equal to seventy per cent of the retirant's average final compensation, the retirant's maximum allowance for the retirant's period of reemployment may not exceed ten per cent of the retirant's average final compensation for the retirant's period of reemployment; and\n\n(2) If the retirant's maximum retirement allowance upon the retirant's initial retirement was equal to or greater than the applicable limit under section 88-74, the retirant shall not earn service credit or earn any additional retirement allowance during the retirant's period of reemployment, and the reemployed retirant shall not make any contributions under section 88-45.\n\n(d) If a retirant's designation of beneficiary was irrevocable upon the retirant's initial retirement, the retirant may not change the retirant's designated beneficiary when the retirant returns to service or when the former retirant again retires.\n\n(e) A retirant who returns to service shall not be considered to be \"in service\", for the purposes of section 88-75, 88-79, 88-84, or 88-85, or any other provision of this chapter providing for benefits arising out of the disability or death of a member.

A member's election to convert class C credited service to class H credited service shall be deemed revoked as to any service for which payments by deductions from compensation do not commence, or for which the lump sum payment is not made, within the time required by this subsection.\n\n(e) The option to convert class C credited service to class H credited service pursuant to this section shall be applicable only to the extent that the conversion may be achieved without affecting the eligibility of the system as a qualified plan under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the eligibility of the employer pick up under section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
