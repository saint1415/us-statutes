      "text": "§235-3 Legislative intent, how Internal Revenue Code shall apply, in general.(a) It is the intent of this chapter, in addition to the essential purpose of raising revenue, to conform the income tax law of the State as closely as may be with the Internal Revenue Code in order to simplify the filing of returns and minimize the taxpayer's burdens in complying with the income tax law. The rules and regulations, forms and procedures adopted and established under this chapter shall conform as nearly as possible, and unless there is good reason to the contrary, to the rules and regulations, forms and procedures adopted and established under the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(b) The Internal Revenue Code, so far as made operative by this chapter, is a statute adopted and incorporated by reference. The Internal Revenue Code shall be applied using changes in nomenclature and other language, including the omission of inapplicable language, where necessary to effectuate the intent of this section. In the Internal Revenue Code, references to terms such as:\n\n(1) \"Secretary or his delegate\" shall refer to the director of taxation and the director's duly authorized subordinates;\n\n(2) \"Estate taxes\" shall refer to the estate and transfer tax imposed by chapter 236D or the estate and generation-skipping [transfer] tax imposed by chapter 236E, as applicable;\n\n(3) \"The highest rate of tax imposed upon individuals\" or \"39.6 per cent\" shall refer to the highest rate imposed upon individuals under section 235-51;\n\n(4) \"The highest rate of tax imposed upon corporations\" shall refer to the highest rate imposed upon corporations under section 235-71; and\n\n(5) \"Interest at the underpayment rate\" or \"interest at the overpayment rate\" shall refer to the interest rate set forth in section 231-39(b)(4) or section 231-23(d)(1), as the case may be.\n\n(c) Where, under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code made operative in this chapter, the allowance or disallowance to a taxpayer of a deduction, exclusion, adjustment, credit, or exemption is dependent on whether, under the Internal Revenue Code or a prior applicable federal income tax law, the following was or was not, is or is not, in relation to the same taxpayer or another taxpayer, for the same taxable year or a prior taxable year, an operative factor: the imposition or payment of an income tax, an inclusion in gross income, an exclusion from gross income, or a deduction from gross income--the allowance or disallowance under this chapter of such deduction, exclusion, adjustment, credit, or exemption shall depend on the operativeness of such factor or factors under this chapter or a prior applicable income tax law of the State. This subsection shall govern the application of such sections of the Internal Revenue Code as, for example, sections 111, 215, 668(b), and 7852(c) and all matters of a similar nature.\n\n(d) Whenever, in a taxable year of a corporation or its shareholders not governed by the income tax law of 1957, a distribution of money, stock, securities, or other property (whether in complete or partial liquidation or otherwise) has been made by a corporation to shareholders owning such shares in the State, or stock, securities, or other property has been transferred to a corporation, or corporate stock or securities exchanged, in the course of a corporate organization or reorganization effected under the laws of the State, in the application of the income tax law of 1957 effect shall be given to the recognition of income by the income tax laws of 1901 and 1932, if any, to the extent necessary to avoid double taxation, for example, in determining the earnings and profits of any corporation involved or the basis of any stock, securities, or other property so received, transferred, or exchanged. No increase in basis shall be allowed on account of such events in taxable years not governed by the income tax law of 1957, except as provided by this subsection. As used in this subsection the words \"double taxation\" mean and refer to double taxation of the same taxpayer, or taxation of both a corporation and its shareholders when the taxation of both would not have occurred had the income tax law of 1957 governed prior taxable years.\n\n(e) In the determination of the basis or adjusted basis of any stock, securities, or other property:\n\n(1) If the property was acquired by an exchange (including an involuntary conversion or the sale of an old residence and purchase of a new residence where both occur within a one-year period) the \"cost\" thereof to the taxpayer shall be deemed to include among other things, any income of the taxpayer recognized by the income tax laws of 1901 and 1932 as a result of the exchange;\n\n(2) If the basis is dependent upon acquisition from a decedent, the property shall be deemed to have been acquired from a decedent if deemed so acquired for the purposes of chapter 236 prior to July 1, 1983, or after June 30, 1983, under this chapter but not otherwise, and the residence or nonresidence of the decedent, the location of the property, and chapter 236 for property acquired prior to July 1, 1983, or this chapter where the property has been acquired after June 30, 1983, shall be considered;\n\n(3) If the basis is dependent upon deductions, exclusions, or exemptions taken or allowable, under the Internal Revenue Code or a prior applicable federal income tax law, in a prior year, it shall depend upon deductions, exclusions, or exemptions taken or allowable under the income tax law of the State governing such prior years;\n\n(4) If the basis is dependent upon the election provided for by section 307, Internal Revenue Code, it shall be governed by the election actually made under the Internal Revenue Code for the taxable year, whether or not the taxable year was governed by the income tax law of 1957.

In the case of a nonresident, the tax applies to the income received or derived from property owned, personal services performed, trade, or business carried on, and any and every other source in the State.\n\nIn the case of a nonresident spouse filing a joint return with a resident spouse, the tax applies to the entire income of the nonresident spouse computed without regard to source in the State.\n\n(c) Change of status. Except where a joint return is filed, when the status of a taxpayer changes during the taxable year from resident to nonresident, or from nonresident to resident, the tax imposed by this chapter applies to the entire income earned during the period of residence in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section and during the period of nonresidence the tax shall apply upon the income received or derived as a nonresident in the manner provided in subsection (b) of this section; provided that if it cannot be determined whether income was received or derived during the period of residence or during the period of nonresidence, there shall be attributed to the State such portion of the income as is determined by applying to such income for the whole taxable year the ratio which the period of residence in the State bears to the whole taxable year, unless the taxpayer shows to the satisfaction of the department of taxation that the result is to attribute to the state income, dependent upon residence, received or derived during the period of nonresidence, in which event the amount of income as to which such showing is made shall be excluded.\n\nThe apportionment of income provided by this subsection shall not apply where one spouse is a resident of this State and a joint return is filed with the nonresident spouse in which event the tax shall be computed on their aggregate income in the manner provided in section 235-52 without regard to source in the State. Where, however, both spouses change their status from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident, their income shall be apportioned in the manner provided in this subsection.\n\n(d) A corporation, foreign or domestic, is taxable upon the income received or derived from property owned, trade or business carried on, and any and every other source in the State. In addition thereto a domestic corporation is taxable upon its income from property owned, trade or business carried on, and any and every other source outside the State, unless subjected to income tax thereon in any other jurisdiction.

The income of a nonresident estate or trust shall be that received or derived from sources in the State.\n\n(2) A beneficiary of an estate or trust, or person treated as the owner of any portion of a trust, who is taxable upon income thereof under the Internal Revenue Code, shall be taxed thereon as herein provided, irrespective of the taxability of the estate or trust or whether it is required to make a fiduciary return under this chapter. If all such income consists of income which would be taxable under this chapter if received directly by the beneficiary or person, the beneficiary or person shall be taxed upon all of it. If some of it consists of income which would not be taxable if received directly by the beneficiary or person, then unless the trust instrument provides otherwise the income of each such beneficiary or person shall be conclusively presumed to have been received or derived out of each class of income of the estate or trust, and the beneficiary or person shall be taxed upon such part of it as would be taxable if received directly by the beneficiary or person.\n\n(3) Each estate or trust shall include in its return all of the information necessary to determine the taxability of the income of the estate or trust, regardless of source.

Upon the total disability of an individual for whose benefit an individual housing account has been established, the individual or the individual's authorized representative may elect to continue the account or terminate the account and be paid the assets; provided that if the account was held jointly by a totally disabled person and a spouse of that person, then the spouse or an authorized representative may elect to continue the account or terminate the account and be paid the assets.\n\n(h) If the individual for whose benefit the individual housing account was established subsequently marries a person who has or has had any interest in residential property, the individual's housing account shall be terminated, the funds therein shall be distributed to the individual, and the amount of the funds shall be includable in the individual's gross income for the taxable year in which such marriage took place; provided that the tax liability defined under subsection (f) shall not be imposed.\n\n(i) The trustee of an individual housing account shall make reports regarding the account to the director and to the individual for whom the account is maintained with respect to contributions, distributions, and other matters as the director may require under rules.

and\n\n(3) If the principal place of employment is at a plant or facility, and there is a strike or lockout involving vocational rehabilitation referrals at the plant or facility, amounts paid or incurred by the employer to the vocational rehabilitation referral for services which are the same as, or substantially similar to, those services performed by employees participating in, or affected by, the strike or lockout during the period of strike or lockout.\n\n(d) The following shall apply to certifications of vocational rehabilitation referrals:\n\n(1) An individual shall not be treated as a vocational rehabilitation referral unless, on or before the day on which the individual begins work for the employer, the employer:\n\n(A) Has received a certification from the department of human services vocational rehabilitation and services for the blind division that the individual is a qualified vocational rehabilitation referral; or\n\n(B) Has requested in writing the certification from the department of human services vocational rehabilitation and services for the blind division that the individual is a qualified vocational rehabilitation referral.\n\nFor purposes of the preceding sentence, if on or before the day on which the individual begins work for the employer, the individual has received from the department of human services vocational rehabilitation and services for the blind division a written preliminary determination that the individual is a vocational rehabilitation referral, then \"the fifth day\" shall be substituted for \"the day\" in the preceding sentence.\n\n(2) If an individual has been certified as a vocational rehabilitation referral and the certification is incorrect because it was based on false information provided by the individual, the certification shall be revoked and wages paid by the employer after the date on which notice of revocation is received by the employer shall not be treated as qualified wages.\n\n(3) In any request for a certification of an individual as vocational rehabilitation referral, the employer shall certify that a good faith effort was made to determine that such individual is a vocational rehabilitation referral.\n\n(e) The following wages paid to vocational rehabilitation referrals are ineligible to be claimed by the employer for this credit:\n\n(1) No wages shall be taken into account under this section with respect to a vocational rehabilitation referral who:\n\n(A) Bears any of the relationships described in section 152(d)(2)(A) to (G) of the Internal Revenue Code to the taxpayer, or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, to an individual who owns, directly or indirectly, more than fifty per cent in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation (determined with the application of section 267(c) of the Internal Revenue Code);\n\n(B) If the taxpayer is an estate or trust, is a grantor, beneficiary, or fiduciary of the estate or trust, or is an individual who bears any of the relationships described in section 152(d)(2)(A) to (G) of the Internal Revenue Code to a grantor, beneficiary, or fiduciary of the estate or trust;

      "text": "§235-61 Withholding of tax on wages.(a) As used in this section:\n\n\"Employee\" includes an officer or elected official, or any other employee.\n\n\"Employer\" means:\n\n(1) The person or government for whom an individual performs or performed any service, of whatever nature, as the employee of that person or government;\n\n(2) The person having control of the payment of the wages if the employer as heretofore defined does not have control thereof; and\n\n(3) Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the State and paying wages on behalf of an employer as heretofore defined if the employer is not subject to the jurisdiction of the State;\n\nprovided that the term employer shall not include any government that is not subject to the laws of the State except as, and to the extent that, it consents to the application of sections 235-61 to 235-67 to it.\n\n\"Wages\" means wages, commissions, fees, salaries, bonuses, and every and all other kinds of remuneration for, or compensation attributable to, services performed by an employee for the employee's employer, including the cash value of all remuneration paid in any medium other than cash and the cost-of-living allowances and other payments included in gross income by section 235-7(b), but excluding income excluded from gross income by section 235-7 or other provisions of this chapter.\n\n(b) Every employer, as defined herein, making payment of wages, as herein defined, to employees, shall deduct and withhold from such wages an amount of tax determined as provided in this section.\n\n(c) For each withholding period (whether weekly, biweekly, monthly, or otherwise) the amount of tax to be withheld under this section shall be at a rate that, for the taxable year, will yield the tax imposed by section 235-51 upon each employee's annual wage, as estimated from the employee's current wage in any withholding period, but for the purposes of this subsection of the rates provided by section 235-51 the maximum to be taken into consideration shall be eight per cent. The tax for the taxable year shall be calculated upon the following assumptions:\n\n(1) That the employee's annual wage, as estimated from the employee's current wage in the withholding period, will be the employee's sole income for the taxable year;\n\n(2) That there will be no deductions therefrom in determining adjusted gross income;\n\n(3) That in determining taxable income there shall be a standard deduction allowance, which shall be an amount equal to one exemption (or more than one exemption if so prescribed by the director) unless the taxpayer:\n\n(A) Is married and the taxpayer's spouse is an employee receiving wages subject to withholding; or\n\n(B) Has withholding exemption certificates in effect with respect to more than one employer.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, any standard deduction allowance under this paragraph shall be treated as if it were denominated a withholding exemption;\n\n(4) That in determining taxable income there also will be deducted the amount of exemptions and withholding allowances granted to the employee in the computation of taxable income, as shown by a certificate to be filed with the employer as provided by subsection (f); and\n\n(5) If it appears from the certificate filed pursuant to subsection (f) that the employee, under section 235-93, is entitled to make a joint return, that the employee and the employee's spouse will so elect.\n\n(d) Alternatively, at the election of the employer, the employer may deduct and withhold from each employee an amount of tax determined on the basis of tables to be prepared and furnished by the department of taxation, which amount of tax shall be substantially equivalent to the amount of tax provided by subsection (c) hereof.\n\n(e) The department, by rule, may require the deduction and withholding of tax from any remuneration or compensation paid for or attributable to services that are not subject to the general excise tax imposed by chapter 237, whether or not a withholding is provided for hereinabove. Every person so required to deduct and withhold tax, or from whom tax is required to be deducted and withheld, shall be subject to sections 235-61 to 235-67, and every person so required to deduct and withhold tax shall be deemed an employer for the purposes of this chapter.\n\nThe department, by rule, may exempt any employer from the requirement of deduction and withholding of taxes, even though the requirement is imposed by this section, if and to the extent that the department finds the requirement unduly onerous or impracticable of enforcement.\n\n(f) On or before the date of the commencement of employment with an employer, the employee shall furnish the employer with a signed certificate relating to the number of exemptions which the employee claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which the employee is entitled on the basis of the existing facts, and also showing whether the employee is married and is, under section 235-93, entitled to make a joint return. The certificate shall be in such form and contain such information as may be prescribed by the department.\n\nIf, on any day during the calendar year, there is a change in the employee's marital status and the employee no longer is entitled to make a joint return, or the number of exemptions to which the employee is entitled is less than the number of exemptions claimed by the employee on the certificate then in effect with respect to the employee, the employee shall within ten days thereafter furnish the employer with a new certificate showing the employee's present marital status, or relating to the number of exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which the employee is entitled on the basis of the existing facts. If, on any day during the calendar year, there is a change in the employee's marital status and though previously not entitled to make a joint return the employee now is so entitled, or the number of exemptions to which the employee is entitled is greater than the number of exemptions claimed, the employee may furnish the employer with a new certificate showing the employee's present marital status, or relating to the number of exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which the employee is entitled on the basis of the existing facts.\n\nSuch certificate shall take effect at the times set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(g) In determining the deduction allowed by subsection (c)(4) an employee shall be entitled to withholding allowances or additional reductions in withholding under this subsection. In determining the number of additional withholding allowances or the amount of additional reductions in withholding under this subsection, the employee may take into account (to the extent and in the manner provided by rules) estimated itemized deductions and tax credits allowable under this chapter; and such additional deductions and other items as may be specified by the director in rules. For the purposes of this subsection a fractional number shall not be taken into account unless it amounts to one-half or more, in which case it shall be increased to the next whole number.\n\n(1) As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\n(A) \"Estimated itemized deductions\" means the aggregate amount which the employee reasonably expects will be allowed as deductions under sections 235-2.3, 235-2.4, 235-2.45, and 235-7, other than the deductions referred to in Internal Revenue Code section 151 and those deductions required to be taken into account in determining adjusted gross income under Internal Revenue Code section 62(a) (with the exception of paragraph 10 thereof) for the estimation year. In no case shall the aggregate amount be greater than the sum of:\n\n(i) The amount of the deductions reflected in the employee's net income tax return for the taxable year preceding the estimation year of (if a return has not been filed for the preceding taxable year at the time the withholding exemption certificate is furnished the employer) the second taxable year preceding the estimation year; or\n\n(ii) The amount of estimated itemized deductions and tax credits allowable under this chapter and any additional deductions to which entitled; and\n\n(iii) The amount of the employee's determinable additional deductions for the estimation year;\n\n(B) \"Estimated wages\" means the aggregate amount which the employee reasonably expects will constitute wages for the estimation year;\n\n(C) \"Determinable additional deductions\" means those estimated itemized deductions which:\n\n(i) Are in excess of the deductions referred to in subparagraph (A) reflected on the employee's net income tax return for the taxable year preceding the estimation year; and\n\n(ii) Are demonstrably attributable to an identifiable event during the estimation year or the preceding taxable year which can reasonably be expected to cause an increase in the amount of such deductions on the net income tax return for the estimation year;\n\n(D) \"Estimation year\", in the case of an employee who files the employee's return on the basis of a calendar year, means the calendar year in which the wages are paid; provided that in the case of an employee who files the employee's return on a basis other than the calendar year, the employee's estimation year, and the amounts deducted and withheld to be governed by the estimation year, shall be determined under rules prescribed by the director of taxation.\n\n(2) Under this subsection, the following special rules shall apply:\n\n(A) Married individuals. The number of withholding allowances to which a husband and wife are entitled under this subsection shall be determined on the basis of their combined wages and deductions. This subparagraph shall not apply to a husband and wife who filed separate returns for the taxable year preceding the estimation year and who reasonably expect to file separate returns for the estimation year;\n\n(B) Limitation. In the case of employees whose estimated wages are at levels at which the amounts deducted and withheld under this chapter generally are insufficient (taking into account a reasonable allowance for deductions and exceptions) to offset the liability for tax under this chapter with respect to the wages from which the amounts are deducted and withheld, the director may by rule reduce the withholding allowances to which those employees would, but for this subparagraph, be entitled under this subsection;\n\n(C) Treatment of allowances. For purposes of this chapter, any withholding allowance under this subsection shall be treated as if it were denominated a withholding exemption.\n\n(3) The director may prescribe tables by rule under chapter 91 pursuant to which employees shall determine the number of withholding allowances to which they are entitled under this subsection.\n\n(h) The director of taxation may adopt by rule under chapter 91 the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Secretary of Treasury or a delegate of the Secretary relating to the provisions of subtitle C, chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code operative in this section.

      "text": "§235-97 Estimates; tax payments; returns.\n\n(a)(1) Individuals, corporations (including S corporations), estates, and trusts, shall annually furnish the department of taxation with a declaration of estimated tax for the current taxable year. Declarations of estimated tax, except as otherwise provided by rule, shall be governed by the provisions as to returns contained in sections 235-94, 235-98, 235-99, and 235-128. The declarations shall be made on estimated tax payment voucher forms. The payment voucher shall be filed, in the case of taxpayers on the calendar year basis, on or before April 20. In the case of a husband and wife who are entitled to submit a joint payment voucher for federal purposes, a single payment voucher may be submitted by them jointly, in which case the liability with respect to the estimated tax shall be joint and several; if a joint payment voucher is submitted but a joint income tax return is not made for the taxable year, the estimated tax for the year may be treated as the estimated tax of either the husband or the wife or may be divided between them.\n\n(2) Each taxpayer shall transmit, with the payment voucher, payment of one-quarter of the estimated tax for the current taxable year. In determining this quarterly payment and all other installments, there first shall be deducted from the total estimated tax the amount of estimated tax withholding or collection at source for the taxable year. Thereafter, on the twentieth day of June and September, the taxpayer shall transmit with the payment voucher, payment of one-quarter of the estimated tax. The fourth quarter payment of the estimated tax shall be transmitted with the payment voucher by January 20 of the year following the taxable year for which the estimate was made.\n\n(3) Taxpayers operating on a fiscal year basis shall make similar estimates and tax payments, on or before the twentieth day of the fourth month of the fiscal year and periodically thereafter so as to conform to the payments and returns required in the case of those on a calendar year basis.\n\n(4) The department by rule may excuse individuals from filing an estimate in those cases where the gross income and exemptions are such that no tax is expected to accrue under this chapter, or are such that substantially all the tax will be collected through tax withholding or at the source.\n\n(5) In the case of a foreign corporation, the department may excuse the filing of an estimate and the payment of estimated tax if it is satisfied that less than fifteen per cent of the corporation's business for the taxable year will be attributable to the State. For the purposes of this paragraph, fifteen per cent of a corporation's business shall be deemed attributable to the State if fifteen per cent or more of the entire gross income of the corporation (which for the purposes of this paragraph means gross income computed without regard to source in the State) is attributable to the State under sections 235-21 to 235-39 or other provisions of this chapter.\n\n(6) In the case of a taxpayer whose tax liability is less than $500, the filing of an estimate and the payment of estimated tax shall not be required.\n\n(b) Net income returns for the taxable year shall be filed with the department on or before the twentieth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year, and shall be accompanied by payment of the balance of the tax for the taxable year, or the entire tax for the taxable year, as the case may be. These returns shall be filed both by persons required to make declarations of estimated tax pursuant to this section and by persons not required to make declarations of estimated tax.\n\n(c) At the election of the taxpayer, any installment of the estimated tax may be paid prior to the date prescribed for its payment.\n\n(d) A person who, under the regulations of the department adopted pursuant to subsection (a)(4), is relieved of filing an estimate, shall if the regulations cease to apply by reason of a change of circumstances during the taxable year, file the required estimate on the first quarterly payment date prescribed for payment of estimated taxes, following such change of circumstances, and pay the estimated tax in equal installments computed by allocating the entire amount shown by the estimate for the current taxable year to the remaining quarterly payment dates.\n\n(e) An amendment of an estimate may be filed, under regulations prescribed by the department. If an amendment is filed, the remaining installments, if any, shall be ratably increased or decreased to reflect the increase or decrease in the estimate. The amended estimate may be accompanied by payment of the amount of underpayment, if any, and if so this shall be considered in determining the period of the underpayment as provided in subsection (g).\n\n(f) In the case of any underpayment of estimated tax, except as provided by this subsection, there shall be added to the tax for the taxable year an amount determined at the rate of two-thirds of one per cent a month or fraction of a month upon the amount of the underpayment for the period of the underpayment.\n\n(1) The amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of:\n\n(A) The required installment, over\n\n(B) The amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the due date for the installment.\n\n(2) The period of the underpayment shall run from the due date for the installment to whichever of the following dates is the earlier:\n\n(A) The twentieth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year, or\n\n(B) With respect to any portion of the underpayment, the date on which the portion is paid. For purposes of this paragraph, a payment of estimated tax on any installment date shall be credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which the installments are required to be paid.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this section, the term \"tax\" means the tax imposed under this chapter reduced by any credits available to the taxpayer other than the credit for amounts withheld from the taxpayer's wages or taxes withheld at the source, if any, or estimated tax payments or payments remitted with extension requests for the taxable year.\n\n(4) Sections 6654(d), (e)(2), (e)(3), (h), (i), (j), (k), and (l), (with respect to failure by an individual to pay estimated income tax), and 6655(d), (e), (g)(2), (g)(3), (g)(4), and (i) (with respect to failure by a corporation to pay estimated income tax) of the Internal Revenue Code, as of the date set forth in section 235-2.3(a), shall be operative for the purposes of this section; provided that the due dates contained in any of the preceding Internal Revenue Code sections shall be deemed to be the twentieth day of the applicable month; and provided further that, for purposes of this chapter in applying section 6654(d), the required annual payment shall be the lesser of sixty per cent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year (or, if no return is filed, sixty per cent of the tax for the taxable year) or one hundred per cent of the tax shown on the return of the individual for the preceding taxable year.\n\n(g) The amounts of taxes withheld from wages or collected at source shall be deemed payments of estimated tax, and an equal part of any such amount shall be deemed paid on each installment date for the taxable year, unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld or collected, in which case the amounts so withheld or collected shall be deemed payments of estimated tax on the dates on which such amounts were actually withheld or collected.

The tax credit shall be as follows:\n\n(1) In the year the investment was made, thirty-five per cent;\n\n(2) In the first year following the year in which the investment was made, twenty-five per cent;\n\n(3) In the second year following the investment, twenty per cent;\n\n(4) In the third year following the investment, ten per cent; and\n\n(5) In the fourth year following the investment, ten per cent;\n\nof the investment made by the taxpayer in each qualified high technology business, up to a maximum allowed credit in the year the investment was made, $700,000; in the first year following the year in which the investment was made, $500,000; in the second year following the year in which the investment was made, $400,000; in the third year following the year in which the investment was made, $200,000; and in the fourth year following the year in which the investment was made, $200,000.\n\n(b) The credit allowed under this section shall be claimed against the net income tax liability for the taxable year. For the purpose of this section, \"net income tax liability\" means net income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed under this chapter.\n\n(c) If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for any of the five years that the credit is taken, the excess of the tax credit over liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted. Every claim, including amended claims, for a tax credit under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed. Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.\n\n(d) If at the close of any taxable year in the five-year period in subsection (a):\n\n(1) The business no longer qualifies as a qualified high technology business;\n\n(2) The business or an interest in the business has been sold by the taxpayer investing in the qualified high technology business; or\n\n(3) The taxpayer has withdrawn the taxpayer's investment wholly or partially from the qualified high technology business;\n\nthe credit claimed under this section shall be recaptured. The recapture shall be equal to ten per cent of the amount of the total tax credit claimed under this section in the preceding two taxable years. The amount of the credit recaptured shall apply only to the investment in the particular qualified high technology business that meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), or (3). The recapture provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a tax credit claimed for a qualified high technology business that does not fall within the provisions of paragraph (1), (2), or (3). The amount of the recaptured tax credit determined under this subsection shall be added to the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year in which the recapture occurs under this subsection.\n\n(e) Every taxpayer, before March 31 of each year in which an investment in a qualified high technology business was made in the previous taxable year, shall submit a written, certified statement to the director of taxation identifying:\n\n(1) Qualified investments, if any, expended in the previous taxable year; and\n\n(2) The amount of tax credits claimed pursuant to this section, if any, in the previous taxable year.\n\n(f) The department shall:\n\n(1) Maintain records of the names and addresses of the taxpayers claiming the credits under this section and the total amount of the qualified investment costs upon which the tax credit is based;\n\n(2) Verify the nature and amount of the qualifying investments;\n\n(3) Total all qualifying and cumulative investments that the department certifies; and\n\n(4) Certify the amount of the tax credit for each taxable year and cumulative amount of the tax credit.\n\nUpon each determination made under this subsection, the department shall issue a certificate to the taxpayer verifying information submitted to the department, including qualifying investment amounts, the credit amount certified for each taxable year, and the cumulative amount of the tax credit during the credit period. The taxpayer shall file the certificate with the taxpayer's tax return with the department.\n\nThe director of taxation may assess and collect a fee to offset the costs of certifying tax credits claims under this section. All fees collected under this section shall be deposited into the tax administration special fund established under section 235-20.5.\n\n(g) As used in this section:\n\n\"Investment tax credit allocation ratio\" means, with respect to a taxpayer that has made an investment in a qualified high technology business, the ratio of:\n\n(1) The amount of the credit under this section that is, or is to be, received by or allocated to the taxpayer over the life of the investment, as a result of the investment; to\n\n(2) The amount of the investment in the qualified high technology business.\n\n\"Qualified high technology business\" means a business, employing or owning capital or property, or maintaining an office, in this State; provided that:\n\n(1) More than fifty per cent of its total business activities are qualified research; and provided further that the business conducts more than seventy-five per cent of its qualified research in this State; or\n\n(2) More than seventy-five per cent of its gross income is derived from qualified research; and provided further that this income is received from:\n\n(A) Products sold from, manufactured in, or produced in this State; or\n\n(B) Services performed in this State.\n\n\"Qualified research\" means the same as defined in section 235-7.3.\n\n(h) Common law principles, including the doctrine of economic substance and business purpose, shall apply to any investment. There exists a presumption that a transaction satisfies the doctrine of economic substance and business purpose to the extent that the special allocation of the high technology business tax credit has an investment tax credit ratio of 1.5 or less of credit for every dollar invested.\n\nTransactions for which an investment tax credit allocation ratio greater than 1.5 but not more than 2.0 of credit for every dollar invested and claimed may be reviewed by the department for applicable doctrines of economic substance and business purpose.\n\nBusinesses claiming a tax credit for transactions with investment tax credit allocation ratios greater than 2.0 of credit for every dollar invested shall substantiate economic merit and business purpose consistent with this section.\n\n(i) For investments made on or after May 1, 2009, notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, no allocations, special or otherwise, of credits under this section may exceed the amount of the investment made by the taxpayer ultimately claiming this credit; and investment tax credit allocation ratios greater than 1.0 of credit for every dollar invested shall not be allowed. In addition, the credit shall be allowed only in accordance with subsection (a).\n\n(j) This section shall not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010.

The cost upon which the credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level and the distribution and share of the tax credit shall be determined pursuant to section 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nIf a deduction is taken under section 179 (with respect to election to expense depreciable business assets) of the Internal Revenue Code, no tax credit shall be allowed for that portion of the qualified expense for which the deduction is taken.\n\nThe basis of eligible property for depreciation or accelerated cost recovery system purposes for state income taxes shall be reduced by the amount of credit allowable and claimed. In the alternative, the taxpayer shall treat the amount of the credit allowable and claimed as a taxable income item for the taxable year in which it is properly recognized under the method of accounting used to compute taxable income.\n\n(c) The amount of a historic preservation income tax credit that is certified by qualified staff of the state historic preservation division of the department of land and natural resources shall be thirty per cent of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures.\n\n(d) The tax credit allowed under this section shall be available in the taxable year in which the substantially rehabilitated certified historic structure is placed into service. In the case of projects completed in phases, the tax credit shall be prorated to the substantially rehabilitated identifiable portion of the certified historic structure placed into service during that taxable year.\n\n(e) If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of the credit over liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's income tax liability in subsequent years until either the credit is exhausted, or for a period of ten years, whichever is earlier.\n\nAll claims for the tax credit under this section, including amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed. Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.\n\n(f) The state historic preservation division shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 establishing standards and criteria for the approval of rehabilitation of certified historic structures for which the tax credit under this section is sought. These standards and criteria shall take into account whether the rehabilitation of a certified historic structure will preserve the historic character of the building.\n\n(g) Following the completion of rehabilitation of a certified historic structure:\n\n(1) The taxpayer shall notify the state historic preservation division that the rehabilitation has been completed and shall provide the state historic preservation division with documentation and certification of the costs incurred in rehabilitating the historic structure;\n\n(2)Qualified staff of the state historic preservation division shall review the rehabilitation and verify the rehabilitation project's compliance with the rehabilitation plan;\n\n(3) Upon each determination made under this subsection, the state historic preservation division shall issue a certificate to the taxpayer verifying that the rehabilitation has been completed in accordance with the approved rehabilitation plan; and\n\n(4) The taxpayer shall file the certificate with the taxpayer's tax return with the department.\n\nThe department of land and natural resources may offset the costs of certifying tax credit claims under this section by assessing and collecting a fee, which shall be deposited into the Hawaii historic preservation special fund established under section 6E-16.\n\n(h) The director of taxation shall prepare any forms that may be necessary to claim the tax credit under this section. The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish reasonable information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.\n\n(i) The aggregate amount of the tax credits claimed for qualified rehabilitation projects shall not exceed:\n\n(1) $1,000,000 for the 2020 taxable year;\n\n(2) $1,000,000 for the 2021 taxable year;\n\n(3) $1,000,000 for the 2022 taxable year;\n\n(4) $1,000,000 for the 2023 taxable year; and\n\n(5) $1,000,000 for the 2024 taxable year.\n\n(j) Each taxpayer claiming a tax credit under this section, no later than the last day of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year in which qualified costs were expended, shall submit a written, certified statement to the state historic preservation division containing the qualified rehabilitation expenditures incurred by the taxpayer and any other information the state historic preservation division or department of taxation may require.\n\nAny taxpayer failing to submit information to the state historic preservation division in a manner prescribed by the state historic preservation division prior to the last day of the twelfth month following the close of the tax year in which qualified costs were expended shall not be eligible to receive the tax credit for those expenses, and any credit already claimed for that taxable year shall be recaptured in total. The amount of the recaptured tax credit shall be added to the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year in which the recapture occurs.\n\nAll information in the statement submitted under this section shall be a public document, except for information that is otherwise exempt from public disclosure in accordance with chapter 92F.\n\n(k) Recapture of a previously claimed tax credit shall be required from any taxpayer who received a credit under this section if any of the following occur:\n\n(1) The projected qualified expenditures do not materialize; or\n\n(2) The rehabilitation of the certified historic structure does not proceed in a timely manner and in accordance with the approved rehabilitation plan.\n\nAny credit under this section shall be recaptured following the close of the taxable year for which the credit is claimed if the department of land and natural resources notifies the department that the taxpayer has failed to comply with the requirements of this section or its related rules promulgated by the state historic preservation division.\n\n(l) The state historic preservation division, in consultation with the department of taxation, shall determine the information necessary to enable a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the outcomes of the tax credit and submit a report to the legislature evaluating the effectiveness of the tax credit no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular legislative session. The report shall include findings and recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the tax credit in order to further encourage the rehabilitation of historic properties.\n\n(m) For the purposes of this section:\n\n\"Certified historic structure\" means any structure that is:\n\n(1) Individually listed in the Hawaii register of historic places or the national register of historic places;\n\n(2) Located in a historic district that is listed in the Hawaii register of historic places or the national register of historic places, and certified by the state historic preservation division as contributing to the significance of the historic district; or\n\n(3) A structure that the state historic preservation division has determined to be eligible for inclusion in the Hawaii register of historic places, and that is subsequently listed in the Hawaii register of historic places by the date of certification by the administrator of the state historic preservation division in accordance with subsection (g).\n\n\"Qualified rehabilitation expenditures\" means any costs incurred for the physical rehabilitation, renovation, or construction of a certified historic structure pursuant to a rehabilitation plan; provided that the term shall not include the taxpayer's personal labor.\n\n\"Qualified staff\" means a staff person meeting the Secretary of the Interior's Historic Preservation Professional Qualification Standards for an architectural historian or historic architect.\n\n\"Rehabilitation plan\" means any construction plans and specifications for the proposed rehabilitation of a historic structure in sufficient detail for evaluation of compliance with the rules adopted by the state historic preservation division.\n\n\"Substantial rehabilitation\" means that the qualified rehabilitation expenditures on a certified historic structure exceed twenty-five per cent of the assessed value of the structure.

      "text": "§235-111 Limitation period for assessment, levy, collection, or credit; net operating loss carrybacks.(a) General rule. The amount of income taxes imposed by this chapter (also the amount of income taxes imposed by any preceding law of the State) and the liability of any employer in respect of wages, shall be assessed or levied and the overpayment, if any, shall be credited within three years after filing of the return for the taxable year, or within three years of the due date prescribed for the filing of the return, whichever is later. No proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of the taxes or the enforcement of the liability shall be begun after the expiration of the period. Where the assessment of the tax imposed by this chapter has been made within the period of limitation applicable thereto, the tax may be collected by levy or by a proceeding in court under chapter 231; provided that the levy is made or the proceeding was begun within fifteen years after the assessment of the tax. For any tax that has been assessed prior to July 1, 2009, the levy or proceeding shall be barred after June 30, 2024.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this section, the limitation on collection after assessment in this section shall be suspended for the period:\n\n(1) The taxpayer agrees to suspend the period;\n\n(2) The assets of the taxpayer are in control or custody of a court in any proceeding before any court of the United States or any state, and for six months thereafter;\n\n(3) An offer in compromise under section 231-3(10) is pending; and\n\n(4) During which the taxpayer is outside the State for a continuous period of at least six months; provided that if at the time of the taxpayer's return to the State the period of limitations on collection after assessment would expire before the expiration of six months from the date of the taxpayer's return, the period shall not expire before the expiration of the six months.\n\n(b) Limitations on credit or refund. Claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of any tax imposed by this chapter shall be filed by the taxpayer or employer within three years from the time the return was filed or from the due date prescribed for the filing of the return, or within two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever is later. For the purposes of this section, taxes paid before the due date of the return shall be deemed to have been paid on the due date of the return determined without regard to any extensions.\n\n(1) If the claim was filed by the taxpayer during the three-year period prescribed in this subsection, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period, immediately preceding the filing of the claim, equal to three years plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return.\n\n(2) If the claim was not filed within the three-year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim.\n\n(3) If no claim was filed, the credit or refund shall not exceed the amount which would be allowable under paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, if the claim was filed on the date the credit or refund is allowed.\n\n(c) Exceptions; fraudulent return or no return. In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax or liability, or of a failure to file return, the tax or liability may be assessed or levied at any time; provided that the burden of proof with respect to the issues of falsity or fraud and intent to evade tax shall be upon the State.\n\n(d) Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in subsection (a) for the assessment, levy, and collection of the tax or liability, or in subsection (b) for the credit or refund of an overpayment, both the department and the taxpayer or employer have consented in writing to its assessment or levy after that date, the tax or liability may be assessed or levied or the overpayment, if any, may be credited at any time prior to the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by the subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.\n\n(e) Overpayment of carrybacks. If an overpayment results from a net operating loss carryback, the statute of limitations in subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply. The overpayment shall be credited within three years of the due date prescribed for filing the return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year of the net operating loss, or the period agreed to under subsection (d) with respect to the taxable year, whichever expires later.
