      "text": "§231-19.5Public inspection and copying of written opinions.(a) Written opinions shall be open to public inspection and copying as provided in this section, notwithstanding sections 235-116, 236D-15, 237-34, and 237D-13 and any other law restricting disclosure of tax returns or tax return information to the contrary. Except as provided in subsection (f), regarding the disclosure of the text of written opinions, chapter 92F shall not apply to tax returns and tax return information.\n\nA written opinion may not be used or cited as precedent unless otherwise provided by department rules.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section, the term \"written opinion\" means a written statement issued by the department to a taxpayer, or to the taxpayer's authorized representative on behalf of the taxpayer, that interprets and applies any provision in title 14 administered by the department to a specific set of facts. A written opinion generally recites the relevant facts, sets forth the applicable provisions of law, and shows the application of the law to the facts. A written opinion shall not include:\n\n(1) Any written communication from the department to any person in connection with the examination or audit of any person's tax return, or in connection with collection activities relating to any person's delinquent tax liability;\n\n(2) An information letter, which is a written statement issued by the department that provides general information by calling attention to a well-established interpretation or principle of tax law, whether or not it applies to a specific set of facts. An information letter may be issued when the nature of the request from the taxpayer suggests that the taxpayer is seeking general information, or where the department believes that general information will assist the taxpayer; or\n\n(3) A determination letter, which is a written statement issued by the department that applies an interpretation or principle of tax law clearly established by statute, rule, written opinion, or published court decision to a particular set of facts. A determination letter includes the grant or denial of consent, permission, exemption or registration, or a routine correspondence in response to taxpayer inquiries. A determination letter shall be designated as such, and shall indicate the clearly established interpretation or principle applied and its source.\n\n(c) Before making a written opinion available for public inspection and copying under subsection (a), the department where possible shall segregate from the opinion trade secrets or other confidential, commercial, and financial information, and identifying details such as the name, address, and social security or tax identification number of the person to whom the written opinion pertains and of any other person identified in the written opinion. Segregated text shall not be disclosed under this section.\n\n(d) Upon issuance of any written opinion, the department shall mail a notice of intention to disclose the opinion together with a copy of the opinion showing the text the department proposes to segregate to any person to whom the written opinion pertains (or any known successor in interest, personal representative, or other person authorized by law to act for or on behalf of such person).\n\n(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a written opinion, as segregated under subsection (c), shall be open to public inspection and copying no earlier than seventy-five days, and no later than ninety days, after the department's notice of intention to disclose is mailed. At the written request of a person to whom the written opinion pertains (or a successor in interest, personal representative, or other person authorized by law to act for or on behalf of the person), the preceding period may be extended, but the department shall make the written opinion available for inspection and copying no later than one hundred eighty days after the notice to disclose is mailed, including extensions.\n\n(f) The department's decision as to what constitutes a written opinion is final. A decision concerning the disclosure of the text of written opinions may be contested, but only in the manner and within the time set forth in this subsection. Any person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2) and who has exhausted the administrative remedies as prescribed by rules adopted by the department may appeal within sixty days of the date of the department's decision to the office of information practices in accordance with procedures established by the office of information practices under sections 92F-15.5 and 92F-42(1). The office of information practices may examine the written opinion at issue, in camera, to assist in determining whether it, or any part of it, may be withheld. In determining whether information constitutes a trade secret or other confidential, commercial, and financial information, the office of information practices may consider and apply, in addition to any other relevant sources, interpretations of those terms under chapter 92F.\n\nOnly the following persons may contest a decision of the department concerning the disclosure of written opinions:\n\n(1) Any person:\n\n(A) To whom a written opinion pertains (or a successor in interest, personal representative, or other person authorized by law to act for or on behalf of the person);\n\n(B) Who has a material interest in maintaining the confidentiality of any written opinion or portion thereof; and\n\n(C) Who disagrees with a decision by the department not to segregate information from any written opinion; or\n\n(2) Any person who is aggrieved by the department's denial of a request to inspect and copy any written opinion or portion thereof.\n\nAny person aggrieved by a decision of the office of information practices may appeal the decision to the circuit court of the first judicial circuit, or of the judicial circuit in which the request for the written opinion is made or in which a copy of the written opinion is maintained by the department. The appeal shall be filed within thirty days after the date of the decision of the office of information practices. The circuit court shall hear the matter de novo. Opinions and ruling of the office of information practices shall be admissible. The circuit court may examine the written opinion at issue, in camera, to assist in determining whether it, or any part of it, may be withheld.\n\nAny person advocating nondisclosure or segregation under paragraph (1) shall have the burden of proof and persuasion, but any person under paragraph (2) need only establish the denial of a request and the department shall have the burden of proof and persuasion to justify the denial of the request to inspect and copy.\n\n(g) Except for cases the circuit court considers of greater importance, proceedings before the court, as authorized by this section, and appeals therefrom, shall be assigned for hearing and trial or for argument at the earliest practicable date and expedited in every way.\n\n(h) Upon appeal to the office of information practices or a court under subsection (f), the written opinion at issue shall not be made available for public inspection and copying pending the final decision in the case. If the final decision in the case determines that the written opinion subject to the appeal shall be open and available to public inspection and copying, or that confidential or identifying information must be segregated, then the department shall make the written opinion available for public inspection and copying not later than thirty days after the decision becomes final. The office of information practices or the court may extend this thirty-day period for such time as the office of information practices or the court finds necessary to allow the department to comply with its decision.\n\n(i) The department shall compile yearly an index in such form as the department determines of all written opinions issued during the preceding calendar year. Copies of the index shall be furnished upon the payment of 50 cents a page. Copies of written opinions shall be furnished upon the payment of $1 a page.\n\n(j) Except as provided in this section, written opinions shall remain subject to all laws governing tax returns and tax return information and the department shall not be required by any court to disclose any written opinion except as specifically authorized by title 14.\n\n(k) No officer or employee of the department shall be in violation of any law prohibiting the disclosure of tax returns or tax return information, or in violation of any other law restricting the disclosure of information, due to the release of any written opinion pursuant to this section.\n\n(l) The department may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to implement this section.

As to all tax payments for which a refund or credit is not authorized by this subsection (including without prejudice to the generality of the cases of unconstitutionality hereinafter mentioned in [paragraph] (1)(C)) the remedies provided by appeal or under section 40-35 are exclusive.\n\n(1) If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid under the chapter imposing a particular tax, or if the amount already paid results in duplication of payment in whole or in part, the excess so paid shall be refunded in the manner provided in subsection (c) subject however to the following limitations:\n\n(A) No refund shall be made unless an application for the refund shall have been made within five years after the amount to be refunded was paid;\n\n(B) No recourse may be had except under section 40-35 or by appeal for refunds of taxes paid pursuant to an assessment by the director of taxation, provided that if the assessment by the director shall contain clerical errors, transposition of figures, typographical errors, and errors in calculation or if there shall be an illegal or erroneous assessment, the usual refund procedures shall apply; or\n\n(C) No refund or overpayment credit shall be made unless the original payment of the tax was due to the law having been interpreted or applied in respect of the taxpayer concerned differently than in respect of taxpayers generally.\n\n(2) In any case where a taxpayer is entitled to a refund, the taxpayer, at the taxpayer's election, may apply the amount of the refund as an overpayment credit to taxes subsequently accruing under the same chapter as that under which the refundable amount was collected.\n\n(b) This subsection shall apply to the taxes collected under chapter 247.\n\nThere may be refunded in the manner provided in subsection (c) such conveyance tax as has been erroneously or unjustly paid.\n\n(c) This subsection shall apply to all taxes.\n\n(1) All refunds shall be paid only upon a form to be known as a \"refund voucher\" prepared by the collector.

The comptroller shall issue a warrant, in the form prescribed by section 40-52, for the payment of any such refund out of the tax reserve fund hereinafter created; provided that if the person entitled to the refund is delinquent in the payment of any tax, the comptroller, upon demand of the collector and after notice to the delinquent taxpayer, shall withhold the amount of the delinquent taxes, together with penalties and interest thereon, from the amount of the refund and pay the same to the collector.\n\n(2) There is hereby appropriated, from the general revenues of the State not otherwise appropriated, the sum of $25,000 which shall be set aside as a trust fund to be known as the tax reserve fund. All refunds of taxes collected by the department under chapters of the law under title 14 administered by the department shall be made out of the tax reserve fund. The director of taxation, from time to time, may deposit taxes collected under chapters of the law under title 14 administered by the department in the state treasury to the credit of the tax reserve fund so that there may be maintained at all times a fund not exceeding $25,000. The amounts deposited shall be made from the taxes with respect to which a particular refund is made.\n\n(d) This subsection shall apply to a refund for an overpayment of a tax:\n\n(1) If the tax return as filed by a taxpayer shows the amount already paid exceeds the amount determined to be the correct amount of the tax due, whether or not the tax was paid by installments, and the taxpayer requests a refund of the overpayment, the amount of the overpayment shall be refunded in the manner provided in subsection (c) within ninety days of the due date of the tax return or the date the tax return is filed, whichever is later; provided that interest on the overpayment shall be paid:\n\n(A) To the taxpayer if the amount overpaid is not refunded within ninety days; and\n\n(B) At the rate of one-third of one per cent of the refund amount for each month or fraction thereof after the ninety-day period, until the refund and any applicable interest is paid to the taxpayer;\n\n(2) If any overpayment of taxes results or arises from:\n\n(A) The taxpayer filing an amended return; or\n\n(B) A determination made by the director; and\n\nthe overpayment is not shown on the original return as filed by the taxpayer, the amount overpaid shall be refunded to the taxpayer within ninety days from the due date of the original return or the date the overpayment is discovered under subparagraphs (A) or (B), whichever occurred later; provided that interest shall be paid to the taxpayer if the amount overpaid is not refunded within ninety days and at the rate of one-third of one per cent of the refund amount for each month or fraction thereof after the ninety-day period, until the refund and any applicable interest is paid to the taxpayer;\n\n(3) For purposes of a net income tax return, if any overpayment of any taxes results from a carryback of a net operating loss, the overpayment shall be deemed to have been made at the close of the taxable year in which the net operating loss arises. To the extent that the carryback of net operating loss results in reducing the amount of underpayment of taxes for prior taxable year or years, interest that would be chargeable because of the underpayment shall not be applicable with respect to that amount or amounts that are carried back; and\n\n(4) In the case of credit, interest shall be paid in the same manner as paragraph (1).

The fees and the cost of the bond shall constitute a part of the costs and expenses of the levy;\n\n(C) Time and place of sale. The sale shall take place and be completed within one hundred eighty days after seizure; provided that the time period set herein shall be tolled during the pendency of any action commenced by any person relating to the seized property until a final order is rendered in that action, whether by stipulation with the person or by court order, or upon the expiration of any extended time as may be agreed upon;\n\n(D) Manner and conditions of sale.

The department may waive all or any part of the period herein allowed.\n\n(f) The department may record in the bureau of conveyances at Honolulu, or in respect of a lien on a motor vehicle, file with the county director of finance, a certificate setting forth the amount of taxes due and unpaid, which have been returned, assessed, or as to which a notice of proposed assessment has issued. The certificate shall identify the taxpayer, the taxpayer's last known address, and the tax or taxes involved. The recording or filing of the certificate has the effect set forth in this section, but nothing in this section shall be deemed to require that a certificate recorded or filed by the department must include the amount of any penalty or interest, in order to protect the lien therefor. The certificate, if recorded or filed with the county director of finance, shall be entered of record as provided by law. Recordation of the certificate in the bureau of conveyances shall be deemed, at such time, for all purposes and without any further action, to procure a lien on land registered in the land court under chapter 501. Any cost incurred in the filing of the certificate shall be a part of the lien for the tax therein set forth.\n\n(g) The department may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien imposed by this section, upon payment in partial satisfaction of such lien, of an amount not less than the value as determined by the department of the lien on the part to be so discharged, or if the department determines that the lien on the part to be discharged has no value. Any such discharge so issued shall be conclusive evidence of the discharge of the lien as therein provided.\n\n(h) The lien imposed by subsection (b) may be foreclosed in a court proceeding or by distraint under section 231-25.\n\n(i) This section shall not apply to a tax levied by a chapter that contains a specific provision for a lien for the tax levied by the chapter, any provision in this section to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n(j) If a lien imposed by subsection (b) is properly recorded as authorized under subsection (f), and three hundred sixty-five days have elapsed from the date of recording with no response or action by the taxpayer against whom the lien was recorded, the director may apply to the circuit court to have the lien converted into a civil judgment. The circuit court shall issue a civil judgment for an amount equivalent to the value of the lien. If a lien is converted to a civil judgment under this subsection, interest under section 231-39(b)(4) shall cease to accrue after the period to collect the unpaid amount has expired under the applicable statute of limitations or agreement.

This paragraph shall not apply to any failure to file a declaration of estimated tax required by section 235-97.\n\n(2) Failure to pay tax.\n\n(A) If any part of any underpayment is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules (but without intent to defraud), there shall be added to the tax an amount up to twenty-five per cent of the underpayment as determined by the director.\n\n(B) If any part of any underpayment of tax required to be shown on a return is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount up to fifty per cent of the underpayment as determined by the director.\n\n(C) If any penalty is assessed under subparagraph (B) (relating to fraud) for an underpayment of tax which is required to be shown on a return, no penalty under paragraph (1) (relating to failure to file the return) shall be assessed with respect to the same underpayment.\n\n(3) Failure to pay tax after filing timely returns. If a return is filed on or before the date prescribed therefor and the amount shown as tax on the return is not completely paid within sixty days of the prescribed filing date, there shall be added to the unpaid tax an amount up to twenty per cent as determined by the director.\n\n(4) Interest on underpayment or nonpayment of tax.\n\n(A) If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment, interest on such amount at the rate of two-thirds of one per cent a month or fraction of a month shall be paid for the period beginning with the first calendar day after the date prescribed for payment, section 231-21 to the contrary notwithstanding, to the date paid.\n\n(B) If the amount of any tax is reduced by reason of a carryback of a net operating loss allowed under chapter 235, such reduction in tax shall not affect the computation of interest under this paragraph for the period ending with the last day of the taxable year in which the net operating loss arises.\n\n(C) Interest prescribed under this paragraph on any tax shall be paid upon notice and demand, and shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as taxes.\n\n(D) No interest under this paragraph shall be imposed on interest provided by this paragraph.\n\n(E) If any portion of a tax is satisfied by credit of any overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed under this paragraph on the portion of the tax so satisfied for any period during which, if the credit had not been made, interest would have been allowable with respect to the overpayment.\n\n(F) Interest prescribed under this paragraph on any tax may be assessed and collected at any time during the period within which the tax to which the interest relates may be collected.\n\n(G) This paragraph shall not apply to any failure to pay estimated tax required by section 235-97.\n\n(c) No taxpayer shall be exempt from any penalty or interest by reason of having contested the tax, but only to the extent that the tax is adjudged to be excessive or contrary to law.
