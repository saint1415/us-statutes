If, but for this sentence, deductions could not be had for expenses of services because the services were rendered by the same person or persons constituting the public utility or could not be had for income taxes, because the taxes were levied against the person or persons constituting the public utility in the person's or their individual capacity and not as a separate entity, there nevertheless shall be allowed as deductions in computing the net operating income a:\n\n(1) Reasonable allowance for the value of personal services actually rendered; and\n\n(2) Proportion of the actual amount of income taxes, federal and state, that fairly represents the portion of the income so taxed that was derived from the public utility business.\n\n\"Partner\" means the same as in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n\"Partnership\" means the same as in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n\"Ports\", \"airports\", or \"points in the State\" shall be deemed to be such if they are loading, unloading, transshipment, assembly, transfer, or relay points.\n\n\"Public highways\" has the meaning defined by section 264-1 including both state and county highways, but operation upon rails shall not be deemed transportation on the public highways.\n\n\"Public service company\" means a public utility, motor carrier, or contract carrier.\n\n\"Public utility\" has the meaning given that term in section 269-1.

The tax imposed by this section is in lieu of all taxes other than those below set out, and is a means of taxing the personal property of the public utility, tangible and intangible, including going concern value. In addition to the tax imposed by this chapter there also are imposed income taxes, the specific taxes imposed by chapter 249, the fees prescribed by chapter 269, any tax specifically imposed by the terms of the public utility's franchise or under chapter 240, the use or consumption tax imposed by chapter 238, and employment taxes.\n\nThe rate of the tax upon the gross income of the public utility shall be four per cent; provided that if:\n\n(1) A county provides by ordinance for a real property tax exemption for real property used by a public utility in its public utility business and owned by the public utility (or leased to it by a lease under which the public utility is required to pay the taxes upon the property), and\n\n(2) The county has not denied the exemption to the public utility, but excluding a denial based upon a dispute as to the ownership, lease, or use of a specific parcel of real property,\n\nthen there shall be levied and assessed a tax in excess of the four per cent rate determined in the manner hereinafter provided upon the gross income allocable to such county. The revenues generated from the tax in excess of the four per cent rate hereinbefore established shall be paid by the public utility directly to such county based upon the proportion of gross income from its public utility business attributable to such county, based upon the allocation made in the public utility's filings with the State of Hawaii; provided that if the gross income from the public utility business attributable to such county is not so allocated in the public utility's State filings, then the gross income from the public utility business shall be equitably allocated to each county. The relative number of access lines in each county shall be deemed an acceptable basis of equitable allocation for telecommunication companies.\n\nThe rate of the tax in excess of the four per cent rate hereinbefore established upon the gross income from the public utility business shall be determined as follows:\n\nIf the ratio of the net income of the company to its gross income is fifteen per cent or less, the rate of tax in excess of the four per cent rate on gross income shall be 1.885 per cent; for all companies having net income in excess of fifteen per cent of the gross, the rate of the tax on gross income shall increase continuously in proportion to the increase in ratio of net income to gross, at such rate that for each increase of one per cent in the ratio of net income to gross, there shall be an increase of .2675 per cent in the rate of the tax.\n\nThe following formula may be used to determine the rate, in which formula the term \"R\" is the ratio of net income to gross income, and \"X\" is the required rate of the tax on gross income for the utility in question:\n\nX = (26.75R-2.1275)%;\n\nprovided that in no case governed by the formula shall \"X\" be less than 1.885 per cent or more than 4.2 per cent.\n\nHowever, if the gross income is apportioned under section 239-8(b) or (c), there shall be no adjustment of the rate of tax on the amount of gross income so apportioned to the State on account of the ratio of the net income to the gross income being in excess of fifteen per cent, and it shall be assumed in such case that the ratio is fifteen per cent or less.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the rate of the tax upon the portion of the gross income of a carrier of passengers by land which consists in passenger fares for transportation between points on a scheduled route, shall be 5.35 per cent. However, if the carrier has other public utility gross income the fares nevertheless shall be included in applying subsection (a) in determining the rate of tax upon the other public utility gross income.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the rate of tax upon the portion of the gross income of:\n\n(1) A public utility that consists of the receipts from the sale of its products or services to another public utility that resells such products or services shall be one-half of one per cent; or\n\n(2) A public utility engaged in the business of selling telecommunication services to a person defined in section 237-13(6)(C) who resells such products or services, shall be one-half of one per cent;\n\nprovided that the resale of the products, services, or telecommunication services is subject to taxation under this section or subject to taxation at the highest rate under section 237-13(6); and provided further that whenever the public utility has other public utility gross income, the gross income from the sale of its products or services to another public utility or a person subject to section 237-13(6)(C) shall be included in applying subsection (a) in determining the rate of tax upon the other public utility gross income.

      "text": "§239-9 Time of application of tax and other provisions.(a) In general. The tax imposed by this chapter applies to every public service company:\n\n(1) Which is in business at the commencement of a calendar year, as of January 1 of that year;\n\n(2) Which begins business after the commencement of a calendar year, as of the commencement of business.\n\n(b) Third year of doing business; earlier years, how governed. If the company is in business at the commencement of the calendar year, and was in business during the whole of the preceding year and prior thereto, the tax shall be returned and paid as provided in sections 239-4 and 239-7.\n\nHowever, if subsection (a)(2) applies, or if the company though in business at the commencement of the calendar year was not in business during the preceding year, or was in business during the preceding year or a part thereof but not prior thereto, the tax shall be returned and paid as provided in subsections (c) and (d).\n\n(c) First year of doing business. The measure of the tax for the year in which the company begins business is an estimate of the gross income of the public service company for that year or for the part of that year in which it is in business.\n\nThe tax thereon for the year in which the company begins business shall be at the following rate:\n\n(1) If subsection (a)(2) applies, at the rate of four per cent, or\n\n(2) If subsection (a)(1) applies but the company though in business at the commencement of the calendar year was not in business during any part of the preceding year, the tax shall be at the rate provided by sections 239-5 and 239-6, except that there shall be no adjustment of the rate of tax on account of the ratio of the net income to the gross income being in excess of fifteen per cent and it shall be assumed for purposes of this subsection and subsection (e) that the ratio is fifteen per cent or less.\n\nThe estimate shall be made and the tax returned on or before the twentieth day of the third month after the month in which the company begins business and shall be subject to adjustment by the filing of an amended return as provided in subsection (e). Payment of the tax shall accompany the return unless time for payment is extended by the director of taxation. The extension may be granted by the director in order to provide for payment of the tax in installments during the remainder of the taxable year.\n\n(d) Second year of doing business. The measure of the tax for the year following the year in which the company began business is an estimate of the average gross income for a taxable year, subject to adjustment by the filing of an amended return as provided in subsection (e). The estimate shall be made and the tax returned and paid at the times provided for other companies which are in business at the commencement of the calendar year. The tax thereon shall be at the rate provided by sections 239-5 and 239-6, except that there shall be no adjustment of the rate of tax on account of the ratio of the net income to the gross income being in excess of fifteen per cent and it shall be assumed for purposes of this subsection and subsection (e) that the ratio is fifteen per cent or less.\n\n(e) Adjustment of estimates. An amended return shall be filed after the close of the applicable taxable year for each year for which an estimated tax return was filed under subsection (c) or (d).\n\nIf the year for which the estimate is made is the year in which the company commenced doing business and subsection (c) applies, any variance between the estimate and the actual gross income for that year shall be adjusted and a credit or refund made, or payment of additional tax due, depending upon whether the estimate was in excess of, or less than, the actual gross income of the company for that year.\n\nIf the year for which the estimate is made is the year following the year in which the company commenced doing business and subsection (d) applies, the average monthly gross income during the period from and after the commencement of business to the close of the year for which the estimate was made shall be determined and multiplied by twelve. Any variance between the estimate and the amount so computed shall be adjusted and a credit or refund made, or payment of additional tax due, depending upon whether the estimate was in excess of, or less than, the amount computed.\n\nThe amended return shall be made and filed and any additional tax due paid on or before the twentieth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year in which the company commenced business.\n\nThe adjustment of the tax imposed under this chapter and the making of an amended return as provided under this section shall apply only to the first and second taxable years of doing business.\n\n(f) Acquisition of business of another company. Whenever any public service company subject for any year to the tax imposed by this chapter, shall have acquired by purchase or otherwise during the preceding year the business or any part thereof of another public service company liable to tax under this chapter for the preceding year but not liable for the year following the sale or disposition, and the acquiring company continues the operation of the business so acquired, the gross income to be reported by the acquiring company for the purpose of determining the amount of its tax under this chapter for the year following the year in which the business was so acquired shall include, in addition to the gross income of the acquiring company during the year ending December 31 or fiscal year preceding, whichever is applicable, the gross income of the business or part thereof so acquired for the portion of the preceding year as the business was not operated by the acquiring company.\n\nThis subsection shall not apply to any company whose tax for the year involved is measured under subsection (c) by an estimate of gross income for the year subject to adjustment after the close of the year.\n\nIf the first paragraph of this subsection applies but the tax of the acquiring company for the year is governed by subsection (d) and adjusted under subsection (e), then in determining the average monthly gross income for that purpose there shall be included, in addition to the gross income of the acquiring company for the period involved in the determination of the average, the gross income of the business or part thereof acquired by the company for the portion of that period in which the business was not operated by the acquiring company.\n\n(g) Consolidation or merger. Whenever there is a consolidation or merger of public service companies, liability to the tax imposed by this chapter shall attach to the company thus formed and the gross income which shall be used for measuring the tax of the company thus formed shall include the gross income of the companies which were consolidated or merged.
