Where restraining orders are issued against the other party to the action, the non-filing party shall be served promptly with the financial restraining order and shall be entitled to a prompt hearing to show cause why the order should not be enforced.\n\n(b) In all actions for annulment, divorce, or separation, the court shall have the power to issue such restraining orders against a person or persons not a party to the action, as shall be reasonably required during the pendency of such action, to preserve the estates of the parties. Where such restraining orders are issued against a person or persons not a party to the action, such persons shall be promptly served with the order and shall be entitled to a prompt hearing within a reasonable time to show cause why such order should not be enforced.\n\n(c) In all actions for annulment, divorce, or separation, the court shall have the power to appoint a master, or masters, to make preliminary findings and to report to the court on any issue. The written reports of a master shall be available to interested parties and may be received in evidence if no objection is made; or if objection is made, may be received in evidence provided the person or persons responsible for the reports are available for cross-examination as to any matter contained therein. When a report is received in evidence, any party may introduce other evidence supplementing, supporting, modifying, or rebutting the whole or any part of the report.\n\n(d) Whenever it is made to appear to the court after the filing of any complaint, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a party thereto may inflict physical abuse upon, threaten by words or conduct, or harass the other party, the court may issue a restraining order to prevent such physical abuse, threats, or harassment, and shall enjoy in respect thereof the powers pertaining to a court of equity. Where necessary, the order may require either or both of the parties involved to leave the marital residence during the period of the order, and may also restrain the party to whom it is directed from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing the children or other relative of the spouse who may be residing with that spouse at the time of the granting of the restraining order. The order may also restrain a party's agents, servants, employees, attorneys, or other persons in active concert or participation with the respective party.\n\n(1) A knowing or intentional violation of a restraining order issued pursuant to this section is a misdemeanor. A person convicted under this section shall undergo domestic violence intervention at any available domestic violence program as ordered by the court. The court additionally shall sentence a person convicted under this section as follows:\n\n(A) For a first conviction for violation of the restraining order, the person shall serve a mandatory minimum jail sentence of forty-eight hours and be fined not less than $150 nor more than $500; provided that the court shall not sentence a defendant to pay a fine unless the defendant is or will be able to pay the fine; and\n\n(B) For the second and any subsequent conviction for violation of the restraining order, the person shall serve a mandatory minimum jail sentence of thirty days and be fined not less than $250 nor more than $1,000; provided that the court shall not sentence a defendant to pay a fine unless the defendant is or will be able to pay the fine.\n\nUpon conviction and sentencing of the defendant, the court shall order that the defendant immediately be incarcerated to serve the mandatory minimum sentence imposed; provided that the defendant may be admitted to bail pending appeal pursuant to chapter 804. The court may stay the imposition of the sentence if special circumstances exist.\n\nThe court may suspend any jail sentence, except for the mandatory sentences under subparagraphs (A) and (B), upon condition that the defendant remain alcohol and drug-free, conviction-free or complete court-ordered assessments or intervention. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the discretion of the judge to impose additional sanctions authorized in sentencing for a misdemeanor offense. All remedies for the enforcement of judgments shall apply to this section.\n\n(2) Any law enforcement officer shall enforce a restraining order issued pursuant to this subsection, including lawfully ordering the restrained party to voluntarily leave for a three-hour cooling off period, or, with or without a warrant, where the law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the restrained party has violated the restraining order, arresting the restrained party.\n\n(e) Any fines collected pursuant to subsection (d) shall be deposited into the spouse and child abuse special account established under section 601-3.6.

In making these further orders, the court shall take into consideration: the respective merits of the parties, the relative abilities of the parties, the condition in which each party will be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for the benefit of the children of the parties, the concealment of or failure to disclose income or an asset, or violation of a restraining order issued under section 580-10(a) or (b), if any, by either party, and all other circumstances of the case. In establishing the amounts of child support, the court shall use the guidelines established under section 576D-7. Provision may be made for the support, maintenance, and education of an adult or minor child and for the support, maintenance, and education of an incompetent adult child regardless of whether the petition is made before or after the child has attained the age of majority. In those cases where child support payments are to continue due to the adult child's pursuance of education, the agency, three months before the adult child's nineteenth birthday, shall send notice by regular mail to the adult child and the custodial parent that prospective child support will be suspended unless proof is provided by the custodial parent or adult child to the child support enforcement agency, before the child's nineteenth birthday, that the child is presently enrolled as a full-time student in school or has been accepted into and plans to attend as a full-time student for the next semester a post-high school university, college, or vocational school. If the custodial parent or adult child fails to do so, prospective child support payments may be automatically suspended by the child support enforcement agency, hearings officer, or court upon the child reaching the age of nineteen years. In addition, if applicable, the agency, hearings officer, or court may issue an order terminating existing assignments against the responsible parent's income and income assignment orders.\n\nIn addition to any other relevant factors considered, the court, in ordering spousal support and maintenance, shall consider the following factors:\n\n(1) Financial resources of the parties;\n\n(2) Ability of the party seeking support and maintenance to meet the party's needs independently;\n\n(3) Duration of the marriage;\n\n(4) Standard of living established during the marriage;\n\n(5) Age of the parties;\n\n(6) Physical and emotional condition of the parties;\n\n(7) Usual occupation of the parties during the marriage;\n\n(8) Vocational skills and employability of the party seeking support and maintenance;\n\n(9) Needs of the parties;\n\n(10) Custodial and child support responsibilities;\n\n(11) Ability of the party from whom support and maintenance is sought to meet the party's own needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking support and maintenance;\n\n(12) Other factors that measure the financial condition in which the parties will be left as the result of the action under which the determination of maintenance is made; and\n\n(13) Probable duration of the need of the party seeking support and maintenance.\n\nThe court may order support and maintenance to a party for an indefinite period or until further order of the court; provided that in the event the court determines that support and maintenance shall be ordered for a specific duration wholly or partly based on competent evidence as to the amount of time that will be required for the party seeking support and maintenance to secure adequate training, education, skills, or other qualifications necessary to qualify for appropriate employment, whether intended to qualify the party for a new occupation, update or expand existing qualification, or otherwise enable or enhance the employability of the party, the court shall order support and maintenance for a period sufficient to allow completion of the training, education, skills, or other activity, and shall allow, in addition, sufficient time for the party to secure appropriate employment.\n\n(b) An order as to the custody, management, and division of property and as to the payment of debts and the attorney's fees, costs and expenses incurred in the divorce shall be final and conclusive as to both parties subject only to appeal as in civil cases. The court shall at all times, including during the pendency of any appeal, have the power to grant any and all orders that may be necessary to protect and provide for the support and maintenance of the parties and any children of the parties to secure justice, to compel either party to advance reasonable amounts for the expenses of the appeal including attorney's fees to be incurred by the other party, and to amend and revise such orders from time to time.\n\n(c) No order entered under the authority of subsection (a) or entered thereafter revising so much of such an order as provides for the support, maintenance, and education of the children of the parties shall impair the power of the court from time to time to revise its orders providing for the support, maintenance, and education of the children of the parties upon a showing of a change in the circumstances of either party or any child of the parties since the entry of any prior order relating to the support, maintenance, and education. The establishment of the guidelines or the adoption of any modifications made to the guidelines set forth in section 576D-7 may constitute a change in circumstances sufficient to permit review of the support order. A material change of circumstances will be presumed if support as calculated pursuant to the guidelines is either ten per cent greater or less than the support amount in the outstanding support order. The need to provide for the child's health care needs through health insurance or other means shall be a basis for petitioning for a modification of the support order. The most current guidelines shall be used to calculate the amount of the child support obligation.\n\n(d) Upon the motion of either party supported by an affidavit setting forth in particular a material change in the physical or financial circumstances of either party, or upon a showing of other good cause, the moving party, in the discretion of the court, and upon adequate notice to the other party, may be granted a hearing. The fact that the moving party is in default or arrears in the performance of any act or payment of any sums theretofore ordered to be done or paid by the party shall not necessarily constitute a bar to the granting of the hearing. The court, upon such hearing, for good cause shown may amend or revise any order and shall consider all proper circumstances in determining the amount of the allowance, if any, which shall thereafter be ordered.\n\n(e) The responsible parent or the custodial parent shall have a right to petition the family court or the child support enforcement agency not more than once every three years for review and adjustment of the child support order without having to show a change in circumstances.

transmutation of property discussed. 73 H. 470, 836 P.2d 484 (1992).\n\nAllowing decree-judgment creditor to enforce collection in circuit court of installment property settlement payments did not usurp family court's exclusive jurisdiction over matters subject to modification by post-divorce decree. 73 H. 566, 836 P.2d 1081 (1992).\n\nFamily court did not disregard any applicable rules or principles of law and did not improperly rely on uniform starting points in marital estate distribution; court's deviation from equal division of joint property was justified in light of wife's significant separate property holdings. 76 H. 19, 868 P.2d 437 (1994).\n\nIntellectual property is capable of division for purposes of equitable distribution. 99 H. 101, 53 P.3d 240 (2002).\n\nTrade secrets may be subject to equitable division pursuant to this section, depending upon when the right to the trade secret vested. 99 H. 101, 53 P.3d 240 (2002).\n\nAs the trial court is afforded broad discretion to allocate between the parties the responsibilities for the payment of the debt of the parties, whether joint, separate, or community, and attorney's fees, costs, and expenses incurred by each party by reason of the divorce, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allocating the second deed of trust debt to wife where wife expressly testified that the funds therefrom were used to pay her attorneys' fees and costs. 125 H. 19, 250 P.3d 775 (2011).\n\nThe family court correctly applied the good cause standard in deciding whether to bifurcate the dissolution of husband and wife's marriage from the remaining parts of the divorce proceeding. 125 H. 308, 260 P.3d 1126 (2011).\n\nFamily court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered educational support for daughter under subsection (a) where the court found that daughter had been blind since birth, completed high school at age 20, and was pursuing her college education by taking a reasonable and appropriate amount of credits to complete college in a timely fashion and was considered a full-time student in view of her sight disability. 125 H. 369, 262 P.3d 245 (2011).\n\nSubsection (a) gives the family court broad authority to make \"just and equitable\" orders compelling a parent \"to provide for the support, maintenance, and education of the children of the parties\" and does not contain any age limit for a child; neither the intermediate appeals court (ICA) case law, the family court's 2004 amended child support guidelines, the legislative history of amendments to this section, nor the legislature's failure to act in response to ICA case law supported father's argument for the age limitation of 23 for educational support. 125 H. 369, 262 P.3d 245 (2011).\n\nWith respect to the equitable division of ownership interests in a copyright, any distribution by the court must result in the authoring-spouse retaining the exclusive rights set forth under 17 U.S.C. §106 (rights to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, and display copyrighted works), but the non-authoring spouse is entitled to an economic interest in the copyright. 127 H. 243, 277 P.3d 968 (2012).\n\nPremarital contributions may be considered by the family court in dividing the marital estate when the parties entered into a premarital economic partnership and cohabited prior to marriage. 133 H. 34, 323 P.3d 1216 (2014).\n\nThe family court erred in determining that the parties did not form a premarital economic partnership, where the family court: relied solely on the party's financial identities; failed to adequately consider the nature and degree to which the parties applied their financial resources, energies, and efforts for the benefit of each other; and weighed against the parties that they truthfully stated their marital status to third parties. 133 H. 34, 323 P.3d 1216 (2014).\n\nWhere husband signed a quitclaim deed transferring husband's entire interest in property to wife, the quitclaim deed did not bar the family court from equitably dividing the property because, based on the family court's findings, the married couple did not intend the quitclaim deed to alter the disposition of their marital partnership property upon their divorce; the intermediate court of appeals erred in concluding that the quitclaim deed was an enforceable separation agreement. 134 H. 29, 332 P.3d 631 (2014).\n\nFamily court should have first determined the date on which the divorce commenced before designating husband's expenditures on girlfriend as marital waste chargeable to husband in the division of marital assets. Any dissipation of marital assets after starting date of divorce was chargeable to husband as marital waste, but the dissipation could not be considered a chargeable reduction if it occurred during the marriage. 135 H. 340, 350 P.3d 1008 (2015).\n\nIn divorce proceedings, family court should not have awarded $3,000 per month in alimony to wife who reported monthly personal expenses of $1,390, absent a finding that she required funds beyond the amount provided in wife's income and expense statement. 135 H. 340, 350 P.3d 1008 (2015).\n\nIn divorce proceedings, husband's financial misconduct during marriage should not have been considered by family court when deciding whether to deviate from an equal division of marital partnership property in the absence of a finding of extraordinary circumstances. Instead, family court should have focused on statutory factors in making its determination of whether equitable considerations justified deviation. 135 H. 340, 350 P.3d 1008 (2015).\n\nIn divorce proceedings, record was inadequate for appellate review of the equities of family court's division of the marital estate. Although family court divided the real estate properties of the marital estate into: (1) properties to be distributed to wife; (2) properties to be distributed to husband; and (3) properties to be sold with proceeds to be divided between wife and husband, family court did not list any of the properties' outstanding mortgages or net market values either at the date of marriage or close of evidence at trial, family court did not assign net market values to each property according to the categories of the partnership model for dividing marital partnership property, and findings regarding spouses' premarital capital contribution and valuation of their properties were incomplete. 135 H. 340, 350 P.3d 1008 (2015).\n\nProvision entitling receipt of rental payments in lieu of payments for spousal support is not a division of property. 1 H. App. 57, 613 P.2d 363 (1980).\n\nWhere payer is (1) unemployed or (2) working but earning less than he or she is capable of earning in other fields, court may consider what payer is capable of earning if payer attempts in good faith to secure proper employment. Court may also consider size of payer's estate and net worth. 1 H. App. 187, 616 P.2d 1014 (1980).\n\n\"Estate of the parties\" construed; phrase includes nonvested military retirement benefits. 1 H. App. 272, 618 P.2d 748 (1980).\n\nSingle lump sum payment, representing plaintiff's interest in defendant's federal civil service retirement, may be awarded rather than a percentage of each monthly payment payable as and when received. 1 H. App. 288, 618 P.2d 754 (1980).\n\nPower of family court to set aside its judgments (before court rules). 1 H. App. 315, 619 P.2d 511 (1980).\n\nFinancial assistance for adult children. 1 H. App. 324, 619 P.2d 112 (1980).\n\nThe source of an asset such as inheritance or gift, is one of the \"circumstances of the case\". 1 H. App. 324, 619 P.2d 112 (1980).\n\nWhere one party unilaterally transfers cash to the children during pendency of the divorce, it is not error for family court to credit the amount of the cash transferred to the party in the division of assets. 1 H. App. 324, 619 P.2d 112 (1980).\n\nForeign judgment; full faith and credit. 1 H. App. 496, 621 P.2d 387 (1980).\n\nIn reviewing the property settlement entered, the standard of review is whether the court below clearly abused its discretion. 1 H. App. 533, 621 P.2d 984 (1981).\n\nAppropriateness of taking into account husband's current economic status, including his remarriage, in determining his obligation to his first family. 1 H. App. 581, 623 P.2d 97 (1981).\n\nIt was not error to receive evidence that wife was living with an adult male friend who was paying part of the living costs and that they planned to be married. 1 H. App. 595, 623 P.2d 95 (1981).\n\nIt was within the lower court's allowable discretion to divide the wife's inheritance from the husband's father. 1 H. App. 595, 623 P.2d 95 (1981).\n\nFamily court's division in the disposition of property will not be set aside unless there has been a manifest abuse of discretion. 1 H. App. 599, 623 P.2d 890 (1981).\n\nAward of costs and attorney's fees. 1 H. App. 617, 623 P.2d 1265 (1981).\n\nFactors that may be considered in dividing property. 1 H. App. 617, 623 P.2d 1265 (1981).\n\nNot error to consider presence of wife's mother and resulting financial impact. 1 H. App. 617, 623 P.2d 1265 (1981).\n\nValuation of partnership. 2 H. App. 485, 634 P.2d 1039 (1981).\n\nDivision of property is res judicata, and any unfairness in that aspect of case is not relevant to spousal support issue; in support modification hearing, burden is on moving party to provide entitlement to modification; hearing is not a rehearing, but a new hearing based on changed circumstances; party receiving spousal support has duty to attain self-sufficiency and party paying spousal support has duty to maintain ability to pay support, neither may benefit from violation of that duty. 3 H. App. 20, 641 P.2d 1342 (1982).\n\nDiscretion in dividing property. 3 H. App. 602, 658 P.2d 329 (1983); 4 H. App. 68, 660 P.2d 529 (1983); 4 H.

App. 68, 660 P.2d 529 (1983).\n\nEquitable to award each party one-half of net value of property jointly owned at time of divorce. 4 H. App. 68, 660 P.2d 529 (1983).\n\nAntenuptial agreement not binding on court. 4 H. App. 333, 666 P.2d 617 (1983).\n\nManifest abuse of discretion in property division. 4 H. App. 652, 673 P.2d 1044 (1983).\n\nDivision of retirement benefits was equitable. 5 H. App. 55, 677 P.2d 966 (1984).\n\nNo error in disregarding conveyance of real property by husband to husband and wife as tenants by entirety. 5 H. App. 348, 691 P.2d 771 (1984).\n\nIf occupancy of residence by mother and children are a combination of spousal and child support, termination of occupancy must be justified as to both spouse and children. 5 H.

App. 207, 716 P.2d 1145 (1985).\n\nCategories of net market values for purposes of property division modified. 7 H. App. 11, 740 P.2d 36 (1987).\n\nAntenuptial agreement binding if equitable; inequitable antenuptial agreement only one of factors considered regarding property division or spousal support; Hawaii's public policy as reflected in this section, takes precedence over parties' right to enforce their antenuptial agreement; no abuse of discretion in court's refusal to enforce antenuptial agreement. 7 H. App. 155, 747 P.2d 698 (1986).\n\nInequitable antenuptial agreement only one of factors to be considered regarding property division; property division terms of antenuptial agreement held inequitable when viewed at time of divorce. 7 H. App. 163, 747 P.2d 703 (1987).\n\nThe family court always has the discretion to award attorney's fees and costs to a party. 7 H. App. 266, 752 P.2d 1079 (1988).\n\n\"Estate of the parties\" means anything of present or prospective value. 7 H.

App. 496, 780 P.2d 581 (1989).\n\nCannot be used against a person who has refused to become legally married. 8 H. App. 215, 797 P.2d 74 (1990).\n\nUniform starting point and other uniform categories are only processes for the family courts to consider, courts must still exercise a wide range of choices and equitable discretion when deciding divorce cases. 8 H. App. 415, 807 P.2d 597 (1991).\n\nWhere record contained insufficient relevant circumstances prior to entry of initial child support order, proof of sufficient relevant circumstances existing at time of modification hearing was conclusive proof of a material change in circumstances. 8 H. App. 437, 809 P.2d 449 (1991).\n\nFamily court overemphasized marriage and underemphasized relative abilities of parties and condition in which each party would be left by divorce in division and distribution of net market value of marital property; discussion of deviation from applicable uniform starting point, when authorized. 9 H. App. 1, 818 P.2d 277 (1991).\n\nSection gave family court discretion to enter conclusion of law regarding payment of attorney's fees and costs. 9 H. App. 184, 828 P.2d 1291 (1992).\n\nIf all relevant and valid considerations equal, deviation from partnership model not justified. 80 H. 79 (App.), 905 P.2d 54 (1995).\n\nCourt properly excluded testimony of wife's alleged pecuniary purpose for marrying husband and her TRO against lover where no evidence that alleged premarital intentions or extramarital relationship negatively affected accumulation or preservation of husband's separate property. 80 H. 274 (App.), 909 P.2d 602 (1996).\n\nIf decree or order finally obtained by offeree after hearing is patently not more favorable as a whole than settlement offer, Hawaii family court rule 68 requires offeree to pay costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred after making of offer, unless court determines such would be inequitable under this section. 82 H. 539 (App.), 923 P.2d 956 (1996).\n\nAdoption of 1988 child support guidelines constituted a change in circumstances sufficient to permit review under subsection (c) of 1983 support order. 87 H. 209 (App.), 953 P.2d 968 (1998).\n\nWhere child support proceeding commenced when mother filed complaint for divorce, child support enforcement agency's motion for modification of child support payments filed twelve years later was \"continuation of proceeding\", and, under §580-3.5 and this section, court had continuing jurisdiction over non-Hawaii domiciliary father. 87 H. 209 (App.), 953 P.2d 968 (1998).\n\nWhere father offered no evidence to support an exceptional circumstance deviation, father failed to overcome presumption that support obligation calculated by using amended child support guidelines was the amount that should be ordered. 87 H. 209 (App.), 953 P.2d 968 (1998).\n\nIt is within family court's discretion to order custodial parent to pay all or part of interstate transportation expenses incurred by children when visiting noncustodial parent if order can be complied with without decreasing funds reasonably necessary to support children and custodial parent at relevant standard of living. 87 H. 369 (App.), 956 P.2d 1301 (1998).\n\nOnce it is determined that a divorce decree award obtained by an offeree is patently not more favorable as a whole than a HFCR rule 68 settlement offer, the trial court must determine whether it would be inequitable to award attorney's fees and costs under rule 68 to the offeror, applying the standards of subsection (f). 89 H. 17 (App.), 968 P.2d 184 (1998).\n\nRelevant statutes, rules, and precedent did not permit wife to directly attack in circuit court the validity of the property and distribution part of the divorce decree; circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction under §603-21.5 to do what wife must have had done to obtain the relief wife sought; pursuant to §580-1 and this section, only the family court could have granted that relief. 101 H. 370 (App.), 68 P.3d 644 (2003).\n\nThe family court may and should consider regular and consistent monetary gifts received by a spouse as part of the spouse's actual financial resources, condition and ability when determining spousal support; pursuant to subsection (d), if and when husband's parents materially reduce their regular and consistent monetary gifts to husband, husband may allege a material change in circumstance and ask the family court for a review of its orders. 112 H. 437 (App.), 146 P.3d 597 (2006).\n\nWhere the family court determined that there were valid and relevant considerations authorizing a deviation from the partnership model division, and the family court's extensive findings of fact clearly showed that in dividing and distributing husband and wife's assets and debts, the court took into consideration the conditions each would be left in after their divorce, court did not violate this section. 120 H. 283 (App.), 205 P.3d 548 (2009).\n\nFamily court abused its discretion by omitting husband's escrow commissions from the marital estate and by excluding any commissions receivable by husband on the non-binding condominium reservation agreements where: (1) the escrow commissions constituted \"income\" earned during the marriage; (2) there was no evidence that husband's existing escrows were for units in projects with financial problems or any other evidence that those escrows might not close, or that husband had to perform any additional duties to receive the escrow commissions; and (3) the commissions were not too speculative to be included in the marital estate. 124 H. 455 (App.), 248 P.3d 221 (2011).\n\nWhere the marriage itself and the existence of jointly owned property were not the only facts proved, the family court was not required to divide each asset and debt equally, and properly equalized the property based on numerous, undisputed findings of fact regarding the circumstances of the marriage pursuant to this section. 124 H. 455 (App.), 248 P.3d 221 (2011).\n\nFamily court did not err when it concluded that husband and wife formed a premarital economic partnership; whether cohabitation was illegal in China did not affect the family court's determination whether prior to their marriage, husband and wife lived together and supported each other financially such that they had established a premarital economic partnership under Hawaii law, and it was within the family court's wide discretion under this section to use this information to formulate a just and equitable division of the parties' property. 127 H. 346 (App.), 279 P.3d 11 (2012).\n\nSection 580-56(d) does not divest the family court of jurisdiction to issue further property distribution orders in response to an order of remand from an appellate court of a timely-decided property division order under subsection (b); upon remand and absent extraordinarily compelling circumstances, the family court retains jurisdiction for no more than one year after the date that the case is lodged again on remand in order to redivide and redistribute the parties' property to the extent required on remand. 127 H. 346 (App.), 279 P.3d 11 (2012).\n\nWhere family court found that there were sufficient valid and relevant considerations to deviate from marital partnership principles, family court did not abuse its discretion when it waived wife's equalization payment. 134 H. 431 (App.), 341 P.3d 1231 (2014).\n\nWhere family court found that wife suffered from numerous ailments since the age of sixteen, wife was medically unable to pursue any gainful employment, and husband had been the sole financial support for the family for the majority of the sixteen year marriage, family court's finding that it would be just and equitable to award wife permanent spousal support did not constitute clear error. (Additional issues discussed include allocation of tax payments and insurance premiums, car valuation, checking and savings accounts, child custody, children's extracurricular activities, intellectual property valuation, and tax consequences of property division.) 134 H. 431 (App.), 341 P.3d 1231 (2014).\n\nWhere husband was still married to prior wife when husband began cohabiting with current wife: (1) the family court's finding that husband's marital status had \"no bearing\" on whether husband and current wife formed a premarital economic partnership (PEP) was harmless error; and (2) family court's finding of a PEP was supported by substantial evidence and, therefore, was not clearly erroneous. 134 H. 431 (App.), 341 P.3d 1231 (2014).\n\nWhere wife did not show that husband's disability benefits included a pension or retirement component, the disability benefits did not constitute a marital asset subject to division and distribution under subsection (a) and wife was not entitled to one-half of husband's future disability income. 134 H. 431 (App.), 341 P.3d 1231 (2014).\n\nWhere divorce agreement registered in a foreign country was valid and effective under the foreign country's law, but the agreement did not expressly address property owned by husband or wife in Hawaii, and where wife did not assert that under the foreign country's law the registration of the divorce agreement would preclude any other further actions to address division of Hawaii property, then, if the family court hasin personamjurisdiction over both parties, the family court may exercise jurisdiction to divide the property of husband and wife located in Hawaii; the family court erroneously concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction. 137 H. 90 (App.), 365 P.3d 1019 (2016).\n\nCited: 14 H. 554, 564 (1903); 26 H. 128, 130 (1921); 29 H. 464, 470 (1926); 44 H. 442, 451, 355 P.2d 33 (1960).\n\nMentioned: 85 H. 108 (App.), 937 P.2d 949 (1997).",
