The attorney general shall provide for the collection, recording, and compilation of data and statistics relating to crime. Unless a child's physical fingerprint record is otherwise authorized to be entered into the system, and notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the attorney general shall purge any child's electronic fingerprint record entered into the identification system pursuant to this subsection either, upon court order or when: the child attains the age of twenty-five years; the child is determined not to be responsible for committing the act for which the fingerprints were taken; or the child is not informally adjusted under section 571-31.4 and a petition is not filed within one year from the date the child is taken into custody.
