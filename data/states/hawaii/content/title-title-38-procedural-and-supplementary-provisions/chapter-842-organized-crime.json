[L 1972, c 71, pt of §2]\n\nIn class action brought against major cigarette manufacturers, tobacco trade associations, and the industry's public relations firm, first amended complaint asserted violations of federal RICO statutes; Hawaii's RICO statute (this section); federal antitrust statutes; Hawaii's antitrust act, chapter 480; various state common-law torts; and false advertising under §708-871; defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim granted, where injuries alleged by plaintiffs trust funds in first amended complaint were not direct; even if remoteness doctrine did not bar claims, claims failed for other reasons. 52 F. Supp. 2d 1196 (1999).\n\nUnder paragraph (3), an \"enterprise\" must (1) have a common or shared purpose, (2) be an ongoing organization with continuity of structure and personnel, and (3) have an ascertainable structure distinct from that inherent in the conduct of the racketeering activity. 84 H. 56, 929 P.2d 69 (1996).\n\nDefinition of \"associated with\" in paragraph (3) includes (1) participation in the operation, management or conduct of the enterprise itself; (2) whether directly or indirectly; and (3) regardless of a stake or interest in the goals of the enterprise. 84 H. 211, 933 P.2d 48 (1997).\n\nSection does not implicate First Amendment concerns because it is neither directed at, nor does it regulate or proscribe First Amendment freedoms, i.e., membership in a political organization or certain beliefs held by an individual. 84 H. 211, 933 P.2d 48 (1997).\n\nTerm \"associated with\" in paragraph (3) not unconstitutionally vague under Hawaii constitution. 84 H. 211, 933 P.2d 48 (1997).\n\nSection 701-109(1)(d) prohibits conviction under both paragraph (2) and §712-1203, as both paragraph (2) and §712-1203 seek to redress the same conduct--the control of an enterprise involved in criminal activity. In such case, the specific statute, §712-1203, governs over this section, the general statute. 88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227 (1998).\n\nWhere (1) no evidence that defendant and one or both of brothers shared a common goal or objective, (2) only defendant's reference to the \"big boss\" tied defendant to an ongoing organization with a system of authority directing individuals in furtherance of the alleged group goals of controlling gambling and drugs, and (3) no evidence of an ascertainable structure distinct from the alleged act of extortion or that an ongoing organization existed, evidence insufficient for purposes of paragraph (3) and the definition of \"enterprise\". 103 H. 68 (App.), 79 P.3d 686 (2003).",

The time allowed for compliance with the demand in whole or in part as deemed proper and ordered by the court shall not run during the pendency of such petition in the court. Such petition shall specify each ground upon which the petitioner relies in seeking such relief, and may be based upon any failure of such demand to comply with the provisions of this section or upon any constitutional or other legal right or privilege of such person.\n\n(i) At any time during which any custodian is in custody or control of any documentary material delivered by any person in compliance with any such demand, such person may file, in the court of the State for the judicial circuit within which the office of such custodian is situated, and serve upon such custodian a petition for an order of such court requiring the performance by such custodian of any duty imposed upon the custodian by this section.\n\n(j) Whenever any petition is filed in any court of the State under this section, such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter so presented, and to enter such order or orders as may be required to carry into effect the provisions of this section.
