App. 122, 678 P.2d 1104 (1984).\n\nSuit authorized as one based on implied contract of warranty of authority. 5 H. App. 616, 705 P.2d 72 (1985).\n\nSuit to recover public assistance benefits wrongfully denied is a claim against State founded upon any statute. 6 H. App. 160, 715 P.2d 813 (1986).\n\nAs the doctrine of primary jurisdiction applies to claims against the employees' retirement system arising out of alleged miscalculation of retirement contribution and benefits, while the circuit court had original jurisdiction over the claim, the court did not abuse its discretion in staying, rather than dismissing, the class action pending administrative review of plaintiffs' individual claims. 121 H. 462 (App.), 220 P.3d 1043 (2009).\n\nWhile the accrual and extent of an employee's benefits are governed by the applicable statutory provisions of chapter 88, the duty of the employees' retirement system to pay accrued benefits is deemed to be contractual under article XVI, §2 of the Hawaii constitution; thus, a circuit court's jurisdiction under paragraph (1) over such claims is \"founded upon contract\", as well as statute and the circuit court did not err in rejecting defendant's contention that plaintiffs' claims were barred by sovereign immunity. 121 H. 462 (App.), 220 P.3d 1043 (2009).\n\nAs this section contains a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for claims against the State that are founded upon a statute or founded upon a contract with the State, the circuit court did not err when it allowed plaintiff substitute teachers to pursue breach-of-contract claims against the State where the teachers were in a contractual relationship with the State, sought money that they claimed were due them for the work they performed under the contract, and alleged that under the express and implied terms of their agreement, they were entitled to pay in accordance with §302A-624(e). 122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009).\n\nThe State's sovereign immunity from plaintiff substitute teachers' claims against the State was waived under this section and §302A-624(e) where §302A-624(e) stated that the per diem salary for substitute teachers \"shall be\" based on the formula that it described, and §302A-624(e), as a pay-mandating statute, provided an alternative basis for invoking the court's jurisdiction under the \"founded upon any statute\" language in this section. 122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009).",
