Upon the filing of the verified complaint or affidavit with the bond and a motion for immediate consideration of the matter, the court shall forthwith inquire into the matter, ex parte or otherwise, as in its discretion it determines. If thereupon the court finds that a prima facie claim for relief has been established, it shall issue an order directed to the sheriff, sheriff's deputy, chief of police, an authorized police officer of any county, or an independent civil process server from the department of law enforcement's list under section 353C-11 to take the property therein described and deliver the same to the plaintiff.\n\n(b) Copies of the verified complaint or affidavit, and, if a bond for immediate seizure has been filed, of the bond, and, if an order for the taking has been issued on an ex parte hearing, of the order, shall forthwith be served upon the defendant in possession and each person having or claiming a possessory interest in the property, in the same manner as is provided for service of summons unless the party to be served has appeared in the action, in which case service may be made in the same manner as is provided for service of papers other than the summons.
