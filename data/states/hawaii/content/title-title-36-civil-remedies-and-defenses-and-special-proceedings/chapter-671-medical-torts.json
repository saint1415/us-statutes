Health care provider shall not mean any nursing institution or nursing service conducted by and for those who rely upon treatment by spiritual means through prayer alone, or employees of the institution or service.\n\n\"Medical tort\" means professional negligence, the rendering of professional service without informed consent, or an error or omission in professional practice, by a health care provider, which proximately causes death, injury, or other damage to a patient.

Rev. 233 (2004).\n\nWhere certain counts of plaintiff's complaint alleged errors or omissions in professional practice by a health care provider, thus falling under the definition of \"medical tort\" under paragraph (2), court properly ruled plaintiff could not proceed with those counts of suit without first submitting them to medical claim conciliation panel as required by § §671-12 and 671-16. 89 H. 188, 970 P.2d 496 (1998).\n\nWhere defendant doctor never properly established at trial the \"therapeutic privilege exception\" to the requirement that informed consent be obtained before starting patient on antipsychotic medication, trial court erred in refusing to instruct jury concerning the tort of negligent failure to provide informed consent. 98 H. 470, 50 P.3d 946 (2002).\n\nAn alleged \"unnecessary, improper and intrusive examination of a woman's breasts\" where the doctor allegedly \"fondled the woman's breasts and squeezed the woman's nipples until they squirted milk in the doctor's face\" is an alleged \"medical tort\" as defined in paragraph (2) because it is an alleged \"error in professional practice, by a health care provider\". 93 H. 490 (App.), 6 P.3d 362 (2000).\n\nWhere defendant was a Hawaii nonprofit organization, which served as the parent corporation of four affiliated hospitals in Hawaii, including Kapiolani, a wholly-owned subsidiary of defendant, defendant was a \"health care provider\" in the context of this chapter. 121 H. 235 (App.), 216 P.3d 1258 (2009).\n\nPlaintiff's claims of neglect, abuse, and failure to provide a safe home against care home defendants did not constitute \"medical torts\" within the meaning of this section; thus, plaintiff was not required to submit plaintiff's claims to a medical claim conciliation panel (MCCP) pursuant to § §671-12 and 671-16 as a condition for plaintiff to file suit against defendants, and the circuit court erred in dismissing plaintiff's suit based on plaintiff's failure to submit plaintiff's claims to a MCCP. 128 H. 405 (App.), 289 P.3d 1041 (2012).",

The standards shall include the substantive content of the information to be given, the manner in which the information is to be given by the health care provider and the manner in which consent is to be given by the patient or the patient's guardian. The substantive content of the information to be given shall include information on the recognized alternative forms of treatment.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section shall require informed consent from a patient or a patient's guardian or legal surrogate when emergency treatment or an emergency procedure is rendered by a health care provider and the obtaining of consent is not reasonably feasible under the circumstances without adversely affecting the condition of the patient's health.\n\n(e) For purposes of this section, \"legal surrogate\" means an agent designated in a power of attorney for health care or surrogate designated or selected in accordance with chapter 327E.

App. 518, 811 P.2d 478 (1991).\n\nA consent form is no substitute for a physician's affirmative duty to inform his or her patient. 86 H. 93 (App.), 947 P.2d 961 (1997).",

If the party initiating the inquiry or the party's attorney is not able to consult with a physician in the same medical specialty as the health care professional against whom the inquiry is made, that party or the party's attorney may consult with a physician who is licensed in this State or in any other state who is knowledgeable and experienced in a medical specialty that is as closely related as practicable to the medical specialty of the health care professional against whom the inquiry is made. The physician or physicians consulted may not be a party to the inquiry, nor be compelled to testify or otherwise participate in proceedings related to the medical inquiry and conciliation panel;\n\n(2) That the party initiating the inquiry or the party's attorney was unable to obtain the consultation required by paragraph (l) because a statute of limitations would impair the action and that the certificate required by paragraph (1) could not be obtained before the impairment of the action. If a certificate is executed pursuant to this paragraph, the certificate required by paragraph (1) shall be filed by the party initiating the inquiry or the party's attorney within ninety days after filing the inquiry; or\n\n(3) That the party initiating the inquiry or the party's attorney was unable to obtain the consultation required by paragraph (1) after the party or the party's attorney had made a good faith attempt to obtain the consultation and the physician contacted would not agree to the consultation. For purposes of this paragraph, \"good faith attempt\" refers to the responsibility of a party initiating an inquiry or the party's attorney to make reasonable efforts to contact a physician for the purpose of reviewing the circumstances upon which an inquiry is based. The party initiating the inquiry or the party's attorney may contact physicians by letter, telephone, facsimile, or other electronic means of communication. If the physician does not respond within a reasonable time, the party initiating the inquiry or the party's attorney may submit the inquiry to the medical inquiry and conciliation panel along with a certificate declaring the nonresponse to the party or the party's attorney's good faith attempt. A \"good faith attempt\" shall ultimately be evaluated in light of the goal of having a qualified physician assist the party initiating the inquiry or the party's attorney in understanding the basis of the inquiry and the determination shall depend upon the circumstances of each individual case.\n\n(b) Where a party initiating an inquiry or the party's attorney intends to rely solely on a failure to inform of the consequences of a procedure (informed consent), this section shall be inapplicable. The party initiating an inquiry or the party's attorney shall certify upon filing of the inquiry that the party or the party's attorney is relying solely on the failure to inform of the consequences of a procedure and for that reason is not filing a certificate as required by this section.\n\n(c) For the purposes of this section, the party initiating an inquiry or the party's attorney shall not be required to disclose the names of any physician consulted to fulfill the requirements of subsection (a) to any of the other parties to the inquiry. The medical inquiry and conciliation panel may require the party initiating an inquiry or the party's attorney to disclose the name of any physician consulted to fulfill the requirements of subsection (a). No disclosure of the name of any physician consulted to fulfill the requirements of subsection (a) shall be made to any of the other parties to the inquiry; provided that the medical inquiry and conciliation panel may contact the physician to determine if the requirements of subsection (a) were met.\n\n(d) Unless a certificate is filed pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), the inquiry shall not be received for filing by the medical inquiry and conciliation panel.
