Supp. 2d 1224 (2011).\n\n§657-1 Six years.The following actions shall be commenced within six years next after the cause of action accrued, and not after:\n\n(1) Actions for the recovery of any debt founded upon any contract, obligation, or liability, excepting such as are brought upon the judgment or decree of a court; excepting further that actions for the recovery of any debt founded upon any contract, obligation, or liability made pursuant to chapter 577A shall be governed by chapter 577A;\n\n(2) Actions upon judgments or decrees rendered in any court not of record in the State, or, subject to section 657-9, in any court of record in any foreign jurisdiction;\n\n(3) Actions for taking or detaining any goods or chattels, including actions in the nature of replevin; and\n\n(4) Personal actions of any nature whatsoever not specifically covered by the laws of the State.

Att. Gen. Op. 63-36.\n\nSix-year limitations period for contracts was considered adequate time for union trust fund to bring action against employer. 823 F.2d 289 (1987).\n\nParagraph (1)'s six-year limitation period applied to employer's claim for breach of duty of loyalty. 338 F.3d 1082 (2003).\n\nIn an action involving claims of wrongful foreclosure, quiet title, and fraudulent joinder, the court noted that no state appellate court had decided that the six-year or twenty-year statute of limitations applied in an action for wrongful foreclosure. Therefore, the court could not conclude that plaintiffs' quiet title claims against defendants who purchased plaintiffs' properties were time-barred, and because it was possible a state court could conclude that plaintiffs' quiet title claims were subject to the twenty-year statute of limitations and thus timely, mortgagee-defendant's fraudulent joinder argument based on the statute of limitations was rejected. 386 F. Supp. 3d 1339 (2019).\n\nApplicable limitations period for actions brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983. 574 F. Supp. 1510 (1983); 749 F.2d 588 (1984).\n\nSix-year statute of limitations governs federal securities fraud claims brought pursuant to Rule 10b-5 of the Rules and Regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and claims brought under Hawaii's civil RICO statute. 758 F. Supp. 1357 (1991).\n\nStatute of limitations in §294-36 [ §431:10C-315's predecessor] applied to underinsured motorist benefits claim, where defendant asserted that appropriate statute of limitations was the statute of limitations applicable to contract actions under this section. 847 F. Supp. 787 (1994).\n\nWhere defendant contended that claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of limitations governing damage to persons and property ( §657-7), since there is no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a \"personal injury\", and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is found in the catchall provision of this section ( §657-1(4)). 986 F. Supp. 1334 (1997).\n\nMagistrate's finding that paragraph (1) did not bar defendant's breach of contract counterclaim due to its relation back under federal rules of civil procedure rule 15(c) not clearly erroneous. 217 F. Supp. 2d 1077 (2001).\n\nCount of complaint alleging breach of contract under the second alleged agreement was barred by the statute of limitations; plaintiffs had constructive knowledge of their cause of action arising out of the second alleged agreement no later than 1996 and the doctrine of constructive notice applied despite any fiduciary relationship that may have existed. Portions of the counts sounding in fraud that related to the second alleged agreement were barred by the statute of limitations. 360 F. Supp. 2d 1122 (2005).\n\nSome of plaintiff's claims for additional minimum rent and percentage rent were time-barred by paragraph (1), where the court found that under Hawaii law, a cause of action for rent accrues upon the due date of each rental payment. 515 F. Supp. 2d 1141 (2007).\n\nWhether the appropriate analogous statute of limitations in actions for attorney's fees under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was §657-7 or paragraph (4), discussed. 621 F. Supp. 2d 1013 (2008).\n\nDoctrine of anticipatory repudiation did not apply to the statute of limitations on plaintiff insured's breach of contract claim where plaintiff claimed that plaintiff fully performed under the life insurance policy and defendant insurers' time for performance had not yet arrived; consequently, plaintiff could not bring an action for breach of contract because it was untimely and, thus, defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted. 792 F. Supp. 2d 1111 (2011).\n\nPlaintiff insured's breach of contract claim time-barred where the claim was brought over twenty-five years after defendant insurers' demands for additional payments and over ten years after defendants confirmed to plaintiff that plaintiff's life insurance policy was terminated; defendants' motion for summary judgment on this issue granted. 792 F. Supp. 2d 1111 (2011).\n\nPlaintiff's claims sounding in fraud were subject to a six-year statute of limitations. 992 F. Supp. 2d 1053 (2014).\n\nPlaintiff was charged with constructive knowledge of the contents of the deed on the date it was recorded; because plaintiff's complaint was filed more than six years after the recording of the allegedly forged deed, plaintiff's claims sounding in fraud were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 992 F. Supp. 2d 1053 (2014).\n\nThe statute of limitations for plaintiff's claim for breach of contract was not tolled by the doctrine of: fraudulent concealment, equitable estoppel, or continuing obligation. 92 F. Supp. 3d 982 (2015).\n\nWhere plaintiff alleged that defendant breached their contract at least as early as 2002, the statute of limitations for plaintiff's breach of contract claim expired some time in 2008. Plaintiff filed its original complaint in 2012, and did not amend its complaint to add a cause of action for breach of contract until 2014, well outside of the statutory limitation period. 92 F. Supp. 3d 982 (2015).\n\nClaims for legal malpractice governed by paragraph (1). 55 H. 167, 517 P.2d 1 (1973).\n\nClaim based on express warranty is in contract and is governed by clause (1); breach of express warranty occurs when. 63 H. 210, 626 P.2d 173 (1981).\n\nClaim based on fraudulent representations or negligent representations is governed by clause (4). 63 H. 210, 620 P.2d 173 (1981).\n\nNot applicable limitations period for arbitration of disputes under no-fault policy. 68 H. 117, 706 P.2d 16 (1985).\n\nSection inapplicable to action seeking enforcement of promissory note which had merged into divorce decree. 73 H. 566, 836 P.2d 1081 (1992).\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations of §657-7 governs actions brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983 rather than six-year catchall limitations period of paragraph (4). 73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247 (1992).\n\nWhere fraudulent misrepresentation action was governed by general limitations period of six years under paragraph (4) and complaint was filed six years four months after death of person making alleged misrepresentation, summary judgment properly granted. 86 H. 21, 946 P.2d 1317 (1997).\n\nThe statute of limitations in a legal malpractice claim is governed by paragraph (1), the accrual of which is determined by application of the discovery rule. 95 H. 247, 21 P.3d 452 (2001).\n\nClaims against sovereign. Statute does not run on claim against sovereign who cannot be sued. 3 H. 483 (1873). When suit permitted against sovereign must be brought within time limited. 11 H. 404 (1898).\n\nExceptions. Statute does not run between death of intestate and appointment of administrator. 3 H. 367 (1872); see 3 H. 483 (1873). Although statute has run, equity may decree repayment. 4 H. 593 (1882). Continuing express trust in personalty not within the statute. 5 H. 497 (1885). Claims of Territory for taxes not barred. 21 H. 597 (1913); 18 H. 252 (1907). Statute tolled by disability of infancy, when. 20 H. 170 (1910). This section does not apply to injuries to land. 20 H. 237 (1910). Statute does not begin to run against district court judgment pending judgment on appeal. 20 H. 370 (1911). Parties may stipulate as to time for action and if reasonable statute does not apply. 23 H. 160, 163 (1916). Ordinarily defense of laches will be applied by analogy to the statute of limitations. 9 H. 571 (1894); 44 H. 297, 300, 353 P.2d 820 (1960). See 32 H. 936 (1934), aff'd 75 F.2d 74 (1935). Defense of statute may be waived. 9 H. 566 (1894); 20 H. 4 (1910); 22 H. 655 (1915). On default court will not exercise for defendant the privilege of the statute. 22 H. 721 (1915). Defense of statute of limitations is personal to defendant; creditor may not invoke statute to cut off prior garnishment based on judgment more than six years old. 50 H. 273, 439 P.2d 217 (1968).\n\nAccount stated, nature of. 51 H. 451, 462 P.2d 476 (1969).\n\nUnder HRCP 15(c), claim asserted in amended pleadings after statute has run will not be barred if it arose out of a timely pleaded factual situation. 52 H. 563, 481 P.2d 310 (1971).\n\nWaiver of statute; where one lulls another as by a stipulation into allowing the statute to run out, one cannot assert the statute as a bar. 52 H. 563, 481 P.2d 310 (1971).\n\nMiscellaneous.

No extension shall be granted without notice and the filing of a non-hearing motion or a hearing motion to extend the life of the judgment or decree.

App. 169, 828 P.2d 1287 (1992).\n\nThe notice requirement contained in this section does not apply to defaulted parties who have not appeared; thus, defendant, as a judgment debtor in default, was not entitled to notice of extension proceedings instituted pursuant to this section. 118 H. 132 (App.), 185 P.3d 880 (2008).\n\nCited: 9 H. 514, 517 (1894).",

Supp. 1285 (1985).\n\nWhere plaintiff knew all that was necessary to trigger the statute of limitations on plaintiff's strict liability claims on date that plaintiff filed worker's compensation claim, plaintiff's strict liability claims were not filed within two years of that date and were accordingly time-barred under this section; defendants' motions for summary judgment on issue of statute of limitations denied as to plaintiff's negligence action, where defendants failed to show that plaintiff had actual or imputed knowledge of defendants' negligence or breach of duty. 854 F. Supp. 702 (1994).\n\nTwo-year limit applied to personal injury claims of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence, claims of discriminatory employment practices under § §378-2 and 378-62, 42 U.S.C. §1983 claim, and claim of discrimination under Title IX. Plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. §1983, Title IX, and state law claims barred, where neither the collective bargaining proceedings nor the equal employment opportunity proceedings tolled the statute of limitations. 874 F.

Supp. 1334 (1996).\n\nWhere defendant contended that claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of limitations governing damage to persons and property ( §657-7), since there is no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a \"personal injury\", and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is found in the catchall provision of §657-1 ( §657-1(4)). 986 F. Supp. 1334 (1997).\n\nIt could not be disputed that by the time the underinsured motorist benefits were paid, plaintiff either knew or should have known that defendant's alleged refusal to engage in settlement negotiations caused plaintiff injury; any claims for emotional distress were time-barred. 11 F. Supp. 2d 1204 (1998).\n\nLimitations period applicable to cause of action for bad faith, discussed; where complaint was not filed until almost one year after the limitations period had lapsed, to the extent that complaint alleged a claim for the tort of bad faith denial of benefits, summary judgment granted in favor of defendant as to plaintiff's claim for tort of bad faith. 11 F. Supp. 2d 1204 (1998).\n\nPlaintiff may rely on events which occurred prior to the limitations period in order to establish intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, as long as the incidents are constant and closely related to the violations which occurred within the period of limitations. 75 F.

Supp. 2d 1113 (1999).\n\nPlaintiff brought forth evidence of a continuing series of conduct which affected plaintiff and plaintiff's work environment; plaintiff's sexual harassment claims may proceed using the evidence, even though much of it predated limitations period; plaintiff may not rely on other proffered evidence because to extent those actions raised claims, statute of limitations had passed. 125 F. Supp. 2d 1224 (2000).\n\nApplying Hawaii's statute of limitations for personal injury claims, which court found was most analogous to plaintiffs' claims under, inter alia, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and where limitations period began at conclusion of administrative proceedings, plaintiffs were within limitations period. 141 F. Supp. 2d 1243 (2001).\n\nPlaintiff's 42 U.S.C. §1983 cause of action for false arrest did not accrue while the criminal charges were pending against plaintiff. 165 F. Supp. 2d 1149 (2001).\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations applied in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act case, where plaintiff sought only attorney's fees and costs for prevailing at the administrative level, not a substantive review of the administrative proceedings. 234 F. Supp. 2d 1156 (2002).\n\nWhere plaintiffs contended that most of their claims were governed by this section, all of plaintiffs' claims were governed by the limitations period established in §663-3; the statute of limitations began to run, as per the terms of §663-3, upon the death of plaintiffs' wife and mother. 396 F. Supp. 2d 1150 (2005).\n\nPlaintiff neglected to file the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against defendants within the two-year tort statute of limitations; among other things, the charge plaintiff filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Hawaii civil rights commission charge did not toll the statute of limitations for the claim. 468 F. Supp. 2d 1210 (2006).\n\nWhere defendants argued that the intentional infliction of emotional distress/negligent infliction of emotional distress claims were time-barred because the time began to run on the date of discharge, there was a triable issue of fact as to when plaintiffs-intervenors discovered the cause of their alleged emotional distress. 535 F. Supp. 2d 1149 (2008).\n\nWhether the appropriate analogous statute of limitations in actions for attorney's fees under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was this statute or §657-1(4), discussed. 621 F. Supp. 2d 1013 (2008).\n\nWhere defendants argued that the intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims were time-barred, there was a triable issue of fact as to when plaintiffs discovered the cause of their alleged emotional distress; \"discovery rule\" applied to the statute of limitations for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims. 795 F. Supp. 2d 1098 (2011).\n\nCourt concluded that plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence claims against apartment association, based on association's alleged refusal to allow owner to have a service dog, were time-barred. Plaintiff failed to bring claims within the two-year statute of limitations, which began to run, under the discovery rule, on the date that plaintiff received letter from association denying plaintiff's request to keep a service dog. 185 F. Supp. 3d 1247 (2016).\n\nCourt concluded that the last act of alleged discrimination or retaliation that plaintiff, a condominium owner, relied upon in plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim and other negligence claims was the filing of a lien on plaintiff's unit by defendant, an apartment association. However, plaintiff did not allege any allegedly unlawful acts within the two-year statute of limitations period before the filing of the complaint. Thus, court concluded that plaintiff's claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligence, gross negligence, and violation of §514B-105 were time-barred. Summary judgment was granted in favor of defendants. 185 F. Supp. 3d 1247 (2016).\n\nWhere plaintiff claimed that plaintiff was entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations because of defendant's efforts to settle dispute without requiring plaintiff to file a civil suit, the court concluded that it did not apply. Even though plaintiff was pursuing a claim with the Hawaii civil rights commission, and attempts were made at settlement negotiations, defendants' participation in such negotiations did not create circumstances beyond plaintiff's control that made it impossible for plaintiff to file a complaint within the statute of limitations. 185 F. Supp. 3d 1247 (2016).\n\nPlaintiff, a consultant, alleged negligence against defendant, interim executive director of the Hawaii Health Connector, for, among other things, failing to forward plaintiff's invoices for payment. Because plaintiff may not have become fully aware of defendant's allegedly negligent acts until after defendant's role as interim executive director had ended, defendant's motion to dismiss was denied, where running of the statute of limitations was not apparent based upon the face of the complaint. 236 F. Supp. 3d 1267 (2017).\n\nApplies to trespass on land. 20 H. 237 (1910).\n\nAmendment to complaint concerning punitive damages may be made, when. 30 H. 17 (1927).\n\nAction to cancel release and prevent its use in action for injuries not subject to defense of laches when action for the injuries not barred. 32 H. 936 (1934), aff'd 75 F.2d 74 (1935).\n\nRevival of cause of action by statute, whether intended. 33 H. 379 (1935), reh'g den. 33 H. 409 (1935).\n\nIn malpractice action statute begins to run when plaintiff discovers, or acting reasonably should have discovered, defendant's alleged negligence. 50 H. 150, 433 P.2d 220 (1967); 2 H. App. 506, 635 P.2d 244 (1981).\n\nStatute begins to run for negligent injury to real property when the plaintiff knows or should have discovered that an actionable wrong has been committed. 50 H. 397, 441 P.2d 636 (1968).\n\nUnder HRCP rule 15(c), claim asserted in amended pleadings after statute has run will not be barred if it arose out of a timely pleaded factual situation. 52 H. 563, 481 P.2d 310 (1971).\n\nWaiver of statute; where one lulls another as by a stipulation into allowing the statute to run out, one cannot assert the statute as a bar. 52 H. 563, 481 P.2d 310 (1971).\n\nStatute of limitations begins to run the moment person discovers or should have discovered the negligent act, the damage, and the causal connection. 65 H. 84, 648 P.2d 689 (1982).\n\nTwo-year statute of limitations governs actions brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983 rather than six-year catchall limitations period of §657-1(4). 73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247 (1992).\n\nClaim of breach of implied warranty of merchantability for personal injury from pacemaker governed under statute of limitations in §490:2-725 rather than this section. 74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273 (1992).\n\nPlaintiff's lack of knowledge regarding a legal duty, the breach of which may have caused plaintiff's injury, did not justify application of \"discovery rule\"; plaintiff's failure to seek legal advice from an attorney did not toll statute of limitations. 81 H. 391, 917 P.2d 718 (1996).\n\nWhere all that had not been discovered by plaintiff was identity of defendant, discovery rule did not apply to toll this section. 82 H. 461, 923 P.2d 403 (1996).\n\nIssue of when childhood sexual abuse victim discovered, or should have discovered, that alleged injuries were caused by defendant's alleged actions was question of fact for jury; reasonable jury could find that victim filed suit within two years of discovering alleged injuries and cause of those injuries. 83 H. 28, 924 P.2d 196 (1996).\n\nReading this section in pari materia with §1-29, the computation of time under the prescribed two-year statute of limitations would exclude the first day on which the cause of action accrues and include the last day, two years thereafter; thus, plaintiff's complaint, filed on the second anniversary of plaintiff's alleged injury, was \"within two years after the cause of action accrued\", and therefore, timely. 99 H. 281, 54 P.3d 452 (2002).\n\nWhere genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether association of apartment owners, through the use of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the negligent act, the damage, and the causal connection between the two more than two years prior to the initiation of the action, and whether the association exercised reasonable diligence in pursuing its claims, trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on the association's negligence claims based on this section. 115 H. 232, 167 P.3d 225 (2007).\n\nSection 657-5 controls over HRCP rule 5(a); thus, notice of a proposed extension of a judgment pursuant to §657-5 must be provided to the judgment debtor prior to the granting of the extension, even if the debtor is in default and is not required under rule 5(a) to be served with pleadings; although failure to provide notice under this section was error, error was harmless where debtor never appeared to defend debtor's self, had an opportunity to be heard at a HRCP rule 60(b) hearing, and offered no defense on the merits to the original judgment or extension, and thus failed to demonstrate any prejudice. 120 H. 1, 200 P.3d 370 (2008).\n\nThe statutory scheme and legislative history of §386-8 indicated that the phrase \"except as limited by chapter 657\" was not intended to restrict an employee's right to intervene in a lawsuit that was timely filed by his or her employer; thus, employee was not barred by the statute of limitations under this section to intervene in plaintiff insurer's timely filed suit, and the circuit court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment. 126 H. 406, 271 P.3d 1165 (2012).\n\nA class action filed in another jurisdiction will toll the applicable Hawaii statute of limitations. 137 H. 217, 368 P.3d 959 (2015).\n\nCross-jurisdictional tolling ends when a court in the other jurisdiction issues an order expressly denying a motion for class certification; or expressly denying the last such motion, if there is more than one motion. Where there is no such express order, cross-jurisdictional tolling ends when that court enters final judgment dismissing the class action. 137 H. 217, 368 P.3d 959 (2015).\n\nAs action for bad faith against insurer is an independent tort, the proper limitation provision for bringing an action should not be that provided in the insurance policy, but rather that provided in this section, which limits causes of action for torts to two years. 88 H. 442 (App.), 967 P.2d 639 (1998).\n\nPlaintiff's lawsuit for injuries to plaintiff's person while a passenger on defendant's plane was governed and barred by the personal injury statute of limitations embodied in this section notwithstanding that the form of the pleading was a claim in contract. 111 H. 67 (App.), 137 P.3d 381 (2006).\n\nCited: 978 F.2d 493 (1992); 198 F.
