order left nothing further to be accomplished and was, therefore, final. 103 H. 153, 80 P.3d 974 (2003).\n\nWhere final order was not reduced to a separate judgment as required by HRCP rule 58, it was not appealable under this section. 113 H. 406, 153 P.3d 1091 (2007).\n\nThe order confirming the partition sale met the requirements of appealability under the Forgay doctrine; the confirmation order effectively terminated the petitioners' rights to the property and they would suffer irreparable injury if appellate review was postponed until final judgment. 131 H. 457, 319 P.3d 376 (2014).\n\nDenial of adjacent property owner's motion for post-judgment relief from trial court's orders granting property owner's motions for summary judgment regarding record title and adverse possession relating to claim for declaratory relief and voluntary dismissal of remaining claims did not constitute an appealable order. 135 H. 482, 353 P.3d 1024 (2015).\n\nAppeal declared frivolous, where appellant appealed decree of foreclosure in a multiple claims and multiple parties case without an HRCP rule 54(b) certification and later argued lack of appellate jurisdiction because of lack of the certification. 2 H. App. 140, 627 P.2d 296 (1981).\n\nForeclosure decree is deemed final for appeal purposes although many matters remain unsettled. 2 H. App. 140, 627 P.2d 296 (1981).\n\nOrder awarding broker's fees in a foreclosure sale case does not have the finality required by subsection (a). 2 H. App. 151, 627 P.2d 304 (1981).\n\nInterlocutory injunctions, when appealable without allowance of trial court. 2 H. App. 272, 630 P.2d 646 (1981).\n\nJudgment in a multiple claims and multiple parties case is not reviewable absent certification under HRCP rule 54(b). 2 H. App. 296, 630 P.2d 1084 (1984).\n\nOrder was interlocutory where it decided liability but left relief pending. 5 H. App. 20, 674 P.2d 1024 (1984).\n\nNot enlarged or modified by HRCP rule 54; where case involves multiple claims or parties, appellate jurisdiction of those fully decided claims or rights must be based on satisfaction of HRCP rule 54 requirements. 5 H. App. 222, 686 P.2d 37 (1984).\n\nOrder adjudging paternity but reserving child support, custody, and other matters is not final and appealable. 5 H. App. 610, 704 P.2d 940 (1985).\n\nInterlocutory appeal by lienor must be sought under this section or HRCP rule 54(b). 7 H. App. 151, 748 P.2d 1370 (1988).\n\nCourt lacked jurisdiction to hear appeal from summary judgment where claims of party in interest not named in notice of appeal remained pending. 8 H. App. 431, 807 P.2d 606 (1991).\n\nProbate court's decision that a parcel of real property is not part of decedent's estate is an appealable collateral order. 83 H. 412 (App.), 927 P.2d 420 (1996).\n\nPlaintiff's appeal of causation order untimely where plaintiff's notice of appeal was filed within thirty days of written order granting plaintiff's motion for leave to file interlocutory appeal, but not within thirty days of order appealed from. 86 H. 301 (App.), 949 P.2d 141 (1997).\n\nWhere Hawaii supreme court entered an order dismissing the appeal of an order selling property, on the ground that \"a final judgment closing the proceeding has not been entered\" and the \"order approving the sale of real property was an interlocutory order that was not certified for interlocutory appeal\", appellate court did not have jurisdiction to decide the point on appeal. 105 H. 507 (App.), 100 P.3d 77 (2004).\n\nWhere all claims against all parties had not been finally decided when the notices of appeal were filed, appellate court did not have appellate jurisdiction and appeal was dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 112 H. 367 (App.), 145 P.3d 910 (2006).\n\nCircuit court's order, to the extent that it denied defendant's request to compel arbitration, was an appealable order where order fell within a small class of orders that were appealable because \"the rights conferred by chapter 658 [repealed], if applicable, would be lost, probably irreparably\" if the party was required to wait until final judgment to effectively review the order. 118 H. 308 (App.), 188 P.3d 822 (2008).\n\nCircuit court erred, where it approved a stipulation to extend the deadline for submitting plaintiff's notice of appeal without requiring a showing of good cause, as required by HRAP rule 4(a)(4)(A). 126 H. 92 (App.), 267 P.3d 676 (2011).",

The court, upon good cause shown, may allow execution to issue or other appropriate action to be taken for the enforcement of the judgment within the ten-day period unless, within such time as shall be allowed by the court, a stay is obtained under subsection (c) or (d).\n\n(c) In its discretion and on such conditions as are proper, the court may stay the execution of or any proceedings to enforce a judgment pending the disposition of a motion for a new trial or other motion, or when justice so requires in other cases until such time as the court may fix.\n\n(d) When an appeal is taken the appellant by giving a supersedeas bond may obtain a stay. The bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice of appeal or of procuring the order allowing the appeal, as the case may be. The stay is effective when the supersedeas bond is approved by the court.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no stay of an appealable order for counsel fee, suit money, temporary alimony, or other provisional order of a like nature made before final judgment in the cause, if the appellee shall give a bond in such amount and with such sureties as the court requires, conditioned for indemnification of the appellant for all damages that the appellant may sustain by reason of the payment or performance of the order, in case the appeal shall be sustained.\n\n(f) Within the meaning of this section \"judgment\" includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.

Executions pending appeal apply to proceedings for summary possession as well as to other proceedings and cannot issue unless upon good cause shown and an opportunity to file supersedeas bond. 15 H. 624 (1904). In cases other than for the nonpayment of rent, an appeal from a judgment of summary possession does not operate as a supersedeas. 27 H. 362 (1923). Liability to execution notwithstanding appeal does not detract from the adequacy of the remedy of assumpsit at law. 27 H. 308 (1923). Bond; on appeal by guardian from money judgment against guardian on accounting, not exempt from bond requirement. 27 H. 129 (1923). Effect of appeal on sequestration. 33 H. 725 (1936); appeal as stay, 33 H. 911 (1936).",

HPD was also not authorized to appeal the order pursuant to the interlocutory appeal statute for defendants, §641-17, or the appeal statute for the prosecution under this section; thus, having no remedy by way of appeal, HPD properly sought redress from the order by mandamus. 122 H. 204, 225 P.3d 646 (2010).\n\nDeferred acceptance of no contest plea not appealable until no contest plea accepted. 5 H.
