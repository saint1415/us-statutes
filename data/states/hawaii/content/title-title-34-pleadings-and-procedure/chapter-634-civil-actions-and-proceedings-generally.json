Supp. 588 (1966).\n\nSufficiency of contact with State for application of statute. 290 F. Supp. 848 (1968).\n\nPlaintiff made a prima facie case that the court had specific personal jurisdiction over defendant; the court's exercise of personal jurisdiction would comport with due process and defendant's contacts with Hawaii, as alleged and evidenced by plaintiff, satisfied Hawaii's long-arm statute. 664 F. Supp. 2d 1103 (2008).\n\nIn an action that arose from a series of agreements among various parties related to a joint venture in New Zealand, defendant, a director of an investment business in New Zealand, claimed that defendant was not subject to the jurisdiction of State courts. However, district court found that plaintiffs had demonstrated the requisite minimum contacts to exercise specific jurisdiction over their tort claims. Defendant had twice traveled to the State to make affirmative representations to residents, finalize transactions, and advance the process whereby residents provided defendant with financial benefits. 431 F. Supp. 3d 1121 (2020).\n\nPrerequisites of minimum contacts to satisfy due process discussed. 54 H. 597, 513 P.2d 165 (1973).\n\nMinimum contact requirement held not met in a medical malpractice action. 56 H. 306, 536 P.2d 568 (1975).\n\nTort is \"committed in this State\" when the injury occurs in this State. 56 H. 306, 536 P.2d 568 (1975).\n\nFacts held sufficient to constitute transaction of business in State. 59 H. 189, 579 P.2d 99 (1978).\n\nEstablishment of contractual relationship through the mail; \"transaction of business\"; minimum contact. 61 H. 644, 608 P.2d 394 (1980).\n\nExpands jurisdiction of Hawaii's courts to extent permitted by due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 61 H. 644, 608 P.2d 394 (1980).\n\nPlaintiff had not demonstrated that defendant was \"transacting business\" in Hawaii; plaintiff sufficiently alleged a prima facie case that defendant committed a \"tortious act within this State\" for purposes of subsection (a)(2); plaintiff sufficiently alleged a tortious breach of contract to satisfy demands of due process. 76 H. 323, 876 P.2d 1291 (1994).\n\nDefendant California theme park's advertising in a national magazine and on an internet website was not \"the transaction of any business within this State\"; also, where plaintiff's injury occurred on a roller coaster ride in defendant's California theme park, the alleged tortious acts occurred in California; thus, trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendants under this section. 102 H. 203, 74 P.3d 26 (2003).",

From and after the time of recording the notice, a person who becomes a purchaser or encumbrancer of the property affected shall be deemed to have constructive notice of the pendency of the action and be bound by any judgment entered therein if the person claims through a party to the action; provided that in the case of registered land, section 501-151, sections 501-241 to 501-248, and part II of chapter 501 shall govern.\n\n(b) This section authorizes the recording of a notice of the pendency of an action in a United States District Court, as well as a state court.\n\n(c) As used in this section, \"action\" includes an administrative enforcement action by any state or county agency, board, or commission against a landowner for a land use violation or a currently unauthorized structure encroaching on public lands, including but not limited to submerged lands or lands within the shoreline, that falls, slides, or comes onto public land, or arises from or benefits an adjoining or abutting private land.

Supp. 695 (1976).\n\nAction in which plaintiff made fraudulent transfer claims under the Hawaii Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (chapter 651C), seeking to avoid the transfer of real property to the extent necessary to satisfy plaintiff's claims and/or to grant plaintiff other relief under §651C-7(a), was an appropriate subject of a lis pendens under the Hawaii doctrine of lis pendens, codified in this section. 457 F.
