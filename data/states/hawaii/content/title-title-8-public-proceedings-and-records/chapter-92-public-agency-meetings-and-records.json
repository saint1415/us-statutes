Rev. 271 (2014).\n\n§92-1 Declaration of policy and intent.In a democracy, the people are vested with the ultimate decision-making power. Governmental agencies exist to aid the people in the formation and conduct of public policy. Opening up the governmental processes to public scrutiny and participation is the only viable and reasonable method of protecting the public's interest. Therefore, the legislature declares that it is the policy of this State that the formation and conduct of public policy - the discussions, deliberations, decisions, and action of governmental agencies - shall be conducted as openly as possible. To implement this policy the legislature declares that:\n\n(1) It is the intent of this part to protect the people's right to know;\n\n(2) The provisions requiring open meetings shall be liberally construed; and\n\n(3) The provisions providing for exceptions to the open meeting requirements shall be strictly construed against closed meetings. [L 1975, c 166, pt of §1]\n\nAttorney General Opinions\n\nThis section and sections 92-7 and 92-9 require commission to specify subject matter of items on public meeting agenda. Att. Gen. Op. 85-2.\n\nInterpretation of \"board\" as excluding county council would be inconsistent with policy and intent of sunshine law. Att. Gen. Op. 86-5.\n\nBased on the office of information practices' construction of the sunshine law as well as the legislative history of §92-7(d), the land use commission and Maui county council did not violate the sunshine law by continuing and reconvening meetings beyond a single continuance without requiring a new agenda and additional public testimony to be accepted at every continued meeting. However, while the legislature did not expressly limit the number of continuances permissible under §92-7(d), the legislative history and text of the sunshine law demonstrates that boards are constrained at all times by the spirit of and purpose of the sunshine law, as stated in this section. 130 H. 228, 307 P.3d 1174 (2013).",

Rev. 21.\n\nEven assuming that written memoranda circulated by council members, in which the council members presented proposed actions, included justifications for the proposals, and sought \"favorable consideration\" of the proposals constituted a permitted interaction under subsection (a), the memoranda violated the mandate under subsection (b) that no permitted interaction be used to circumvent the spirit or requirements of the sunshine law to make a decision or to deliberate toward a decision upon board business. The \"express premise\" of the sunshine law is that opening up the government process to public scrutiny is the only viable and reasonable way to protect the public. 130 H. 228, 307 P.3d 1174 (2013).\n\nWritten memoranda circulated by council members, in which the council members presented proposed actions, included justifications for the proposals, and sought \"favorable consideration\" of the proposals did not fall within the permitted interaction described in subsection (a) because the memoranda: (1) were distributed among all of the members of the Maui county council rather than among only two members of the board; and (2) sought a commitment to vote by asking for \"favorable consideration\" of the proposals contained within them and thus, violated the sunshine law. 130 H. 228, 307 P.3d 1174 (2013).\n\nAlthough subsection (a) does not expressly preclude city counsel members from engaging in serial one-on-one conversations, when council members engaged in a series of one-on-one conversations relating to a particular item of council business, under §92-5(b), the spirit of the open meeting requirement was circumvented and the strong policy of having public bodies deliberate and decide its business in view of the public was thwarted and frustrated. 117 H. 1 (App.), 175 P.3d 111.",

Any circuit court, upon the written application of any member of the board or of any master appointed by it as in this section provided, shall have power to enforce obedience to the subpoena by contempt proceedings.\n\n(2) Through the chairperson, acting chairperson, or any member of the board, or through the executive secretary or executive officer of or under the board so authorized by the board, to administer oaths to witnesses and require the testimony of such witnesses on matters germane to the subject under inquiry at the hearing. Any party to the hearing upon request shall be allowed to be represented by counsel and be allowed reasonable rights of examination and cross-examination of witnesses. Any false swearing by a witness at the hearing upon any material issue or matter shall constitute perjury, and be punishable as such.\n\n(3) To appoint, by written resolution adopted by vote of a majority of the board, a master or masters (who may, but need not be, a member or members of the board, or a disinterested attorney at law or other person, or a combination of any of them) to hold the hearing and take testimony upon the matters involved in the hearing and report to the board the master's or their findings and recommendations, together with a transcript of the hearing or a summary of the evidence and testimony taken thereat, and to adopt the findings and recommendations, in whole or in part, or otherwise act upon the report and transcript or summary, and, in the board's discretion, to hold further hearings and take further evidence and testimony in connection therewith, before taking final action thereon. Any master may be paid such reasonable compensation as shall be determined by the board, provided that no member of the board shall be eligible to receive any additional compensation for services as master.\n\n(b) Subpoena fees, master's fees, and other expenses in connection with the hearings shall be payable out of any moneys appropriated or available for expenditure by the board for personal services or current expenses, or both.

If the board finds that the charge constitutes a violation, the board may order one or more of the following remedies as appropriate relief:\n\n(1) Refunding the money paid as fees for services;\n\n(2) Correcting the work done in providing services;\n\n(3) Revocation of the licensee's permit or license;\n\n(4) Suspension of the licensee's permit or license;\n\n(5) Imposition of a fine; and\n\n(6) Any other reasonable means to secure relief as determined by the board.\n\nThe board may also assess the licensee, as a penalty, any cost incurred in publishing the notice of hearing when service by registered or certified mail to the address listed on the licensee's record is unsuccessful.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary:\n\n(1) No license or permit shall be suspended by the board for a period exceeding five years.\n\n(2) A person whose license or permit has been revoked by the board may not reapply for a license until the expiration of at least five years from the effective date of the revocation of the license or permit.\n\n(3) A suspended license or permit shall be reinstated at the end of the suspension; provided that the suspension does not carry forward to the next license period, and the person satisfies all licensing requirements and conditions contained in the order of the suspension. If a suspension carries forward to the next license period, the board shall not renew the suspended license or permit during the usual renewal period. At the end of the suspension period, a person whose license or permit was suspended may be reinstated upon filing a reinstatement form provided by the board and payment of the renewal fees, satisfaction of any other renewal requirements, and fulfillment of conditions, if any, contained in the order of suspension. If the person fails to file for reinstatement within thirty days after the end of the suspension, the person's license or permit shall be forfeited.\n\n(d) The failure or refusal of the licensee to comply with any board order, including an order of license suspension, shall also constitute grounds for further disciplinary action, including a suspension or revocation of license, imposition of which shall be subject to chapter 91 and the procedural rules of the board. The board may also apply to any circuit court for injunctive relief to compel compliance with the board's order. Where appropriate, the board shall refer for prosecution to the proper authority any practice constituting a violation which is subject to criminal penalty.\n\n(e) If the subject matter of the complaint does not come within its jurisdiction, or if it is found that the charge does not constitute a violation, the board shall notify and inform the complainant in writing with regard to the reasons for its inability to act upon the complaint.\n\n(f) The complainant and the licensee or person regulated may agree to resolve the complaint through final and binding arbitration pursuant to chapter 658A. In the event of an agreement to arbitrate, the board may enter an order dismissing any proceeding instituted pursuant to subsection (b); provided that the order of dismissal may be conditioned upon prompt and complete compliance with the arbitrator's award. In the event that the licensee or person regulated fails to comply with the terms of the arbitrator's award, the board may reopen the proceeding and may, after a hearing in conformity with chapter 91, order one or more of the remedies set forth in subsection (b).\n\nNotwithstanding any provision of chapter 658A to the contrary, an arbitration agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall be approved by the board, and the parties shall agree on an arbitrator within five days after execution of the agreement. If the parties fail to agree on an arbitrator within the time above prescribed, the board may appoint an arbitrator from a list of arbitrators maintained for that purpose by the department of commerce and consumer affairs.\n\n(g) A fine levied in a final order of a board or commission pursuant to subsection (b) shall be confirmed as a judgment by a circuit court in which the respondent resides or has property or in which the act complained of had occurred, by filing the board or commission's final order any time after thirty days after the issuance of that final order. The judgment issued thereon shall have the same force and effect and be enforceable and collectible as any other judgment issued in the circuit court. Nothing herein shall impair the right of the board or commission to apply to the circuit court for injunctive relief pursuant to subsection (d).
