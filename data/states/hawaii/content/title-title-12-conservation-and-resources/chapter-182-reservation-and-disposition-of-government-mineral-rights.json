The board may hold the public auction of the mining lease within six months from the date of the first notice or any further time that may be reasonably necessary. Whether or not the state land sought to be auctioned is then being utilized or put to some productive use, the board, after due notice of public hearing to all parties in interest, within six weeks from the date of the first notice or any further time that may be reasonably necessary, shall determine whether the proposed mining operation or the existing or reasonably foreseeable future use of the land would be of greater benefit to the State. If the board determines that the existing or reasonably foreseeable future use would be of greater benefit to the State than the proposed mining use of the land, it shall disapprove the application for a mining lease of the land without putting the land to auction. The board shall determine the area to be offered for lease and, after due notice of public hearing to all parties in interest, may modify the boundaries of the land areas. At least thirty days prior to the holding of any public auction, the board shall cause a public notice to be given in the State at least once in each of three successive weeks, setting forth the description of the land, the minerals to be leased, and the time and place of the auction.

The department may review and approve all expenses and costs that may be reimbursed.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an application for a mining lease submitted pursuant to this section may be granted by the board in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 171-95.3.

If the board determines that the research period would be beneficial, it shall fix the period of research and shall also fix a minimum expenditure for labor performed or money spent by the lessee on research and development and the method by which the lessee shall establish that such expenditure in fact be made. In these leases, the obligation to commence mining operations within three years shall not commence until the expiration of the research period.\n\n(e) For the period of the lease the lessee shall have the exclusive right of possession of the minerals leased and the exclusive rights to mine and remove the minerals by means that shall be reasonable and satisfactory to the board and to occupy and use so much of the surface of the land as may reasonably be required, subject to the provisions of section 182-3. The right to use the surface shall include the right to erect transportation facilities thereon, construct plants for beneficiating, drying, and processing the minerals for electric power generation and transmission and other uses as may be approved by the board. The other uses may include but need not be limited to uses necessary or convenient to the processing of the minerals; provided that the lessee shall comply with all water and air pollution control laws, and rules of the State or its political subdivisions.\n\n(f) The lessee may retain all minerals separated from the land as a part of the process of mining the minerals specified in the mining lease; provided that the lease may prescribe the accounting and testing procedures by which the amount and quality of the additional materials shall be determined for the purpose of computing the excise tax thereon and the applicable royalty that may be set by the board for the use of the minerals.

Allocation of royalties from geothermal developments on DHHL lands to entities other than DHHL would be violations of both the Admission Act and the Hawaii constitution because those proceeds would not be available to DHHL to carry out the terms and conditions of the HHCA.

With respect to all geothermal mining leases previously issued or to be issued, where the board determines that it is necessary to encourage the initial or continued production of geothermal resources, the board shall have the authority to waive royalty payments to the State for any fixed period of time up to but not exceeding eight years.\n\n(b) The board shall adopt, amend, or repeal rules pursuant to chapter 91 to establish the basis upon which the amount and duration of royalty payments to the State will be fixed or waived. The board's assessment of each application shall include, but not be limited to, the examination of such factors as the progress of geothermal development taking place in the State at the time of the application, the technical and financial capabilities of the applicant to undertake the project, and the need for providing a financial incentive in order for the applicant to proceed. The granting of any favorable terms to an applicant for the payment of royalties under this section may be revoked by the board if the applicant fails to satisfy any of the terms and conditions established by the board, or if the applicant wholly ceases operations and for reasons other than events which are outside the control of the parties and which could not be avoided by the exercise of due care by the parties.\n\n(c) The board shall submit a written report of all geothermal royalty dispositions to the legislature in accordance with section 171-29. [L 1985, c 138, §1]\n\nCross References\n\nRoyalty to counties, see §182-7(c).\n\nAttorney General Opinions\n\nAllocating royalties from geothermal developments on department of Hawaiian home lands (DHHL) lands to the board of land and natural resources or the counties violated §4 of the Admission Act and article XII, § §1 and 3 of the Hawaii constitution. It is clear from the Admission Act and the Hawaii constitution that the State has an obligation to manage such resources on Hawaiian home lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA). Allocation of royalties from geothermal developments on DHHL lands to entities other than DHHL would be violations of both the Admission Act and the Hawaii constitution because those proceeds would not be available to DHHL to carry out the terms and conditions of the HHCA.
