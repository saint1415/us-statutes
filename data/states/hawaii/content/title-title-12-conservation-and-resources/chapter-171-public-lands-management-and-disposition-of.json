No such lands shall be sold or leased for a sum less than the value fixed by appraisal; provided that for any sale or lease at public auction, the board may establish the upset sale or rental price at less than the appraisal value set by an employee of the board and the land may be sold or leased at that price. The board shall be reimbursed by the purchaser or lessee for the cost of any appraisal required to be made by a disinterested appraiser or appraisers contracted for by the board.\n\n(b) The sale price or lease rental of lands to be disposed of by drawing or by negotiation shall be no less than the value determined by:\n\n(1) An employee of the board qualified to appraise lands; or\n\n(2) A disinterested appraiser or appraisers whose services shall be contracted for by the board, and the appraisal, and any further appraisal with the approval of the board, shall be at the cost of the purchaser;\n\nprovided that the sale price or lease rental shall be determined by disinterested appraisal whenever prudent management so dictates; provided further that if the purchaser does not agree upon the sale price or lease rental, the purchaser may appoint an appraiser who shall conduct an appraisal on behalf of the purchaser. If, after the purchaser's appraisal, the board and the purchaser do not agree on the sale price or lease rental, the parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute through nonbinding mediation by a single mediator, appointed by mutual agreement of the parties. The cost of mediation shall be borne equally by the parties. If mediation does not resolve the dispute, the purchaser's appraiser together with the board's appraiser shall appoint a third appraiser, and the sale price or lease rental shall be determined by arbitration as provided for in chapter 658A, which shall be final and binding. The purchaser shall pay for all appraisal costs, except that the cost of the third appraiser shall be borne equally by the purchaser and the board.\n\n(c) In the repurchase of any land by the board, the board shall have the option to repurchase the land for the original sale price or the fair market value at the time of repurchase, whichever is the lower.

Each party shall pay for its own appraiser. If the board's and the lessee's appraisers do not agree upon the lease rental, the lessee and the board shall in good faith attempt to resolve the dispute by nonbinding mediation by a single mediator mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the dispute is not resolved by the mediation, the fair market rental shall be determined by arbitration as provided in chapter 658A, which shall be final and binding. Either the board or the lessee may initiate arbitration by a written demand to the other party. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, who shall be an attorney licensed in the State, a person with experience in contracts and real estate valuation, or another qualified person, who shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties.

The amount to which the department of Hawaiian home lands is entitled shall be determined by multiplying the fair market value of the land by thirty per cent. For the purpose of this section:\n\n\"Fair market value\" means the amount of money that a purchaser willing but not obliged to buy the land would pay to an owner willing but not obliged to sell it, taking into consideration the highest and best use of the land.\n\n\"Highest and best use\" means the most profitable, probable, and legal use to which the land can be put.\n\n(b) Fair market value shall be determined on a per acre basis pursuant to appraisals performed in conformance with the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice as adopted by the department of commerce and consumer affairs, not more than ninety days before the conveyance of the land to the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. The appraisals shall be performed by two disinterested appraisers each of whose services shall be contracted by the department and the department of Hawaiian home lands, respectively. If the land is sugarcane lands and of the public land trust, as defined in section 10-2, the department of Hawaiian home lands and the office of Hawaiian affairs shall contract the services of one appraiser. The parties shall contract the services of the two appraisers within thirty days after the department gives written notice to the department of Hawaiian home lands, together with the office of Hawaiian affairs if the land is sugarcane lands and of the public land trust, of the proposed conveyance of the land to the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation.\n\nIf any party fails or refuses to contract the services of an appraiser, then the other party may petition the circuit court in the county where the land is located to appoint the other of the two appraisers. If the two appraisers are unable to agree on a fair market value, then within thirty days thereafter, the department and the department of Hawaiian home lands, together with the office of Hawaiian affairs if the land is sugarcane lands and of the public land trust, shall contract for the services of a mutually agreed upon third appraiser and the decision of the majority of the appraisers shall be final with respect to determination of the fair market value of the land.

Payment to the department of Hawaiian home lands may be in the form of public lands or moneys. If payment is to be made in the form of public lands, the lands shall be mutually agreed upon by the department of land and natural resources and the department of Hawaiian home lands, and shall be of value comparable to the amount due to the department of Hawaiian home lands. Any monetary payment shall be an obligation of the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation. Any portion of that amount that is not paid on the date of conveyance shall be subject to simple interest annually, established pursuant to the fifteen year treasury rate at the time of the conveyance and payable annually by the State to the department of Hawaiian home lands.\n\n(d) Thirty per cent of the revenue received by the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation from commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential use of the land shall be paid annually to the department of Hawaiian home lands; provided that:\n\n(1) The department of Hawaiian home lands shall not receive payment under this subsection until the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation recovers all moneys previously paid to the department of Hawaiian home lands for that portion of land used for commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential purposes;\n\n(2) If borrowed moneys are used to finance the development of land for commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential purposes, annual payments due to the department of Hawaiian home lands under this subsection shall be made pursuant to the following order of priority:\n\n(A) The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation satisfies as a first priority the amount computed annually on the pro rata portion (not the total debt service over the life of the debt) of its total debt service on the borrowed moneys;\n\n(B) The Hawaii housing finance and development corporation satisfies as a second priority its operating expense obligations directly incurred from the development and operating of land used for commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential purposes in an amount not exceeding one per cent of revenues; and\n\n(C) After the first and second priorities are satisfied, the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation shall make annual payments due to the department of Hawaiian home lands under this subsection from any remaining revenues; and\n\n(3) In the event of a sale of land used for commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential purposes, the department of Hawaiian home lands shall receive thirty per cent of the revenue received by the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation.\n\n(e) This section shall only apply to the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation's developments known as the villages of Leali`i, Maui, and villages of La`i`opua, Hawaii.

The term \"remnant\" means a parcel of land economically or physically unsuitable or undesirable for development or utilization as a separate unit by reason of location, size, shape, or other characteristics. A remnant may be:\n\n(1) Land acquired by condemnation which is in excess of the needs for which condemned;\n\n(2) Vacated, closed, abandoned, or discontinued road, street or alley or walk, railroad, ditch, or other right-of-way.\n\n(b) Disposition restriction. No parcel shall be disposed of as a remnant solely for the reason that it lacks an adequate access.\n\n(c) Disposition. Remnants or portions thereof may be disposed of by the board of land and natural resources without recourse to public auction in the manner set forth herein. Any remnant or portion thereof to be disposed of shall be first offered for sale to the abutting owner for a reasonable period of time at a reasonable price based on appraised value. In the event that one abutting landowner lacks access to a street, and such access can be secured by disposition of the remnant, such remnant shall be first offered for sale to such abutting owner, or subdivided so as to protect the access of all abutting landowners. If there is more than one abutting owner who is interested in purchasing the remnant, it shall be sold to the one submitting a sealed bid containing the highest offer above the appraised value. If the remnant abuts more than one parcel, the board may subdivide the remnant so that a portion thereof may be sold to each abutting owner at the appraised value; provided that no remnant shall be sold to any abutting owner unless the remnant, when combined or consolidated with the abutting property, shall constitute a lot acceptable to the appropriate agency of the county in which the remnant lies; and provided further that appropriate language shall be included in any document of conveyance of such remnant to assure use of the remnant in accordance with the applicable ordinances, rules, and regulations of the county concerned.\n\n(d) Appraisal. The value of the remnant or portion thereof shall be appraised by an independent appraiser, which appraisal shall take into consideration the limited market for the remnant and the resulting enhancement to an abutting owner's property by the addition of the remnant. The value of a remnant or portion thereof which is surplus to state highway requirements and is in the inventory of such surplus remnants as of December 31, 1981, may be appraised by an employee of the State qualified to appraise lands.

A fee simple patent shall be issued to every existing occupier under a certificate of occupation issued heretofore, and to every lessee under a nine hundred and ninety-nine year homestead lease issued heretofore, of public lands, where the lands have been improved under the certificate or lease, or have been used as a place of residence by the occupier or lessee for an aggregate continuous period of not less than ten years upon payment to the board of land and natural resources of a fair market price, disregarding the value of the improvements made by the occupier or lessee, which price shall be determined by appraisal as provided for in this chapter; provided that the board may exclude from these patents areas required as roadways to other lots.\n\n(b) Issuance of patent, lessee of right of purchase lease. The lessee of any existing right of purchase lease, at a time and under conditions that are contained in the lease, shall be entitled to a land patent from the board conveying to the lessee a fee simple title to the land described in the lessee's lease upon the payment of the fair market price of the land as determined by appraisal as provided for in this chapter; provided that the lessee has reduced to cultivation twenty-five per cent of the premises and has resided thereon not less than two years and has substantially performed all other conditions of the lessee's lease.\n\n(c) Cash freeholds, agreement, patent, conditions. At the end of three years from the date of the payment of the first installment, the holder of a freehold agreement is entitled to a land patent for the premises described therein, if the following conditions, in addition to those set forth herein, have been substantially performed:\n\n(1) Payment of the balance of the purchase price in equal installments, in one, two, and three years respectively, from the date of the freehold agreement with interest annually at the rate of four per cent; provided that the freeholder may pay the installment before it is due and thereby stop the corresponding interest;\n\n(2) Cultivation of not less than twenty-five per cent of the area of the premises, and the planting and care of not less than an average of ten timber, shade, or fruit trees per acre, if agricultural land, at any one time before the end of the third year, or fencing in the premises if pastoral land within that time; provided that if the premises are classed as pastoral-agricultural land, the foregoing alternative conditions shall apply respectively to the two kinds of land;\n\n(3) Maintenance by the freeholder of the freeholder's home on the premises from the end of the first to the end of the third year;\n\n(4) Conditions for the prevention of waste, the planting of trees or the protection of trees growing or to be planted on the premises, or for the destruction of vegetable pests that may be on the premises or the prevention of the future introduction of pests thereon;\n\n(5) Payment of all taxes that may be due on account of the premises.\n\nThe holder of a freehold agreement shall allow the land agents to enter and examine the premises at all reasonable times to see that the conditions are being performed. The holder shall not assign or sublet, conditionally or otherwise, the holder's interest or any part thereof, under the freehold agreement, without the written consent of the board indorsed on the agreement; and provided further that freeholders having the whole interest in a freehold agreement, at any time when all the conditions thereof to be performed by the freeholder up to that time shall have been substantially performed, may surrender to the government the interest by delivery of the freehold agreement to the land agent, with the intention to surrender the interest clearly indorsed thereon and signed by them and duly attested. The surrender shall release the freeholders from all further duty or performance of the conditions of the instrument surrendered. But no surrender shall be permitted if any freeholders are under the age of eighteen years, unless the minors are represented by statutory guardians; and provided further that any freeholder over the age of eighteen may assign the freeholder's interest to the freeholder's cotenants.\n\n(d) Right of purchase lease; termination, forfeiture, or surrender. Upon the termination of a right of purchase lease by lapse of time, or upon the forfeiture or surrender of the lease or a freehold agreement, the board, in its discretion and within the limit of its authority, may open the premises or any part thereof for disposition in the manner or for the uses as provided in this chapter. Before the disposition, the fair market value thereof shall be established by appraisal. The value attributable to the improvements in the appraisal shall be paid to the surrendering lessees or freeholders, upon resale of the premises, and the director of finance shall pay the amount of the valuation upon the requisition of the board out of the funds.\n\n(e) Transfer or assignment; certificate of occupation or homestead lease. No existing certificate of occupation or existing homestead lease, or fractional interest thereof, shall be transferable or assignable except by conveyance, devise, bequest, or intestate succession and with the prior approval of the board of land and natural resources; provided that transfer or assignment by conveyance, devise, or bequest shall be limited to a member or members of the occupier's or lessee's family or in the case of a homestead lease, to any person or persons designated as a trustee of a land trust.\n\nFor the purposes of this section:\n\n\"Family\" means the spouse, reciprocal beneficiary, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, a parent's siblings, children of a parent's siblings, and grandchildren of a parent's siblings, of the occupier or lessee.\n\n\"Land trust\" means a trust created for the purposes of managing and holding the homestead leasehold estate for the benefit of the lessee and lessee's family members. The lessee may be the trustee of the trust.\n\nAll the successors shall be subject to the performance of the unperformed conditions of the certificate of occupation or the homestead lease.\n\n(f) Option of cotenant to compel others to buy or sell. In case two or more persons become cotenants under any existing right of purchase lease, certificate of occupation, or homestead lease by inheritance or otherwise, any one or more of the persons, less than the whole number, may file in the office of the land agent an offer to the remainder of the persons to buy their interest in the premises or to sell them their own interest therein at a stated price, according to the proportion of the respective interest in question, and may deposit with the land agent the amount of the offered price in money, with a fee of $10. The land agent shall thereupon notify the persons to whom the offer is made of the nature of the offer and order them to file with the land agent their answer within sixty days whether they will buy or sell according to the offer. If the persons to whom the offer is made file with the land agent within sixty days of the time of their receiving the notification, their answer stating that they will sell their interest according to the terms of the offer, the land agent shall indorse the fact of the sale with the amount of the consideration on the lease and pay to the persons the amount of the consideration deposited with the land agent according to their individual interest; and the interest of the persons shall thereupon vest in the persons making the offer. The fact of the transfer shall be properly recorded in the official records of the land agent and indorsed upon the lease held by the lessee.\n\nIf, however, the persons to whom the offer is made fail to answer within sixty days from the time of their being notified of the offer or within sixty days from the time the notice of the offer [is] mailed to their last known place or places of abode, or shall answer within sixty days that they will buy the interest of the persons making the offer on the terms offered, but fail within sixty days after the notification to deposit the amount representing the value of the interest according to the terms offered, their interest shall vest in the persons making the offer and the amount of the consideration shall be paid by the land agent of them individually or their respective representatives upon application. In such case, the fact of the transfer shall be recorded and indorsed as above provided.\n\nIn the event that any funds held by the land agent hereunder are not paid to the persons to whom properly payable, because of the inability of the land agent to locate those persons, the funds, after the expiration of one year, shall be deposited in the department of budget and finance of the State and there abide the claim of any person thereto lawfully entitled; provided that no claim to the funds shall be allowed unless the claim is made within five years after the deposit. Payment of any claim duly filed may be made if the department of budget and finance and the board concur in finding the claim valid and proper, but if the claimant fails to obtain concurrency of the department of budget and finance and the board within sixty days of the filing of the claimant's claim, the claimant may present a petition to the circuit court of the first judicial circuit in that behalf, notice whereof shall be given to the attorney general, who may appear and defend on behalf of the State, and if the court renders a judgment in favor of the claimant, the department of budget and finance shall pay the amount due without interest.\n\nBut if the persons to whom the offer is made, within sixty days from the time of the notification, shall make answer to the land agent that they will buy the interest of the offering parties and shall deposit within sixty days with the land agent the amount required for the purpose according to the terms of the offer, the land agent shall indorse and record the fact of the sale as above provided, and pay to the offering parties the amount according to their individual interest; and the interest of the offering parties shall thereupon vest in the answering parties. In such case, the consideration money deposited by the offering parties shall be returned to them.\n\n(g) Forfeiture; existing certificate of occupation or homestead lease. The violation of any of the conditions of any existing certificate of occupation or homestead lease shall be sufficient cause for the board, upon failure of the occupier or lessee within a reasonable period of time to remedy the default, after notice thereof in the manner provided in section 171-20, to take possession of the demised premises without demand or previous entry, with or without legal process, and thereby, subject to section 171-21, terminate the estate created.\n\n(h) Forfeiture; cash freeholds. In the case of default in the payment of any of the installments due on any cash freehold agreement for thirty days after the installments are due, or failure of performance of any other conditions, the board may take possession of the premises, upon failure of the freeholder within a reasonable period of time to remedy the default, after notice thereof in the manner provided in section 171-20, without demand or previous entry, with or without legal process, and thereby subject to section 171-21, terminate the estate created.\n\n(i) Mortgage of homestead leases. Whenever an existing homestead lease is mortgaged pursuant to section 171-22, the consent to mortgage from the board of land and natural resources may contain a condition exempting the lease from subsection (e) for the duration of the mortgage.
