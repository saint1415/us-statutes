[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1975, c 163, §8; am L 1986, c 314, §2]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §701-105\n\nSection 105 of the Proposed Draft of the Code provided: \"The commentary accompanying this Code shall be published with the Code and may be used as evidence of legislative intent and as an aid in construing the provisions of this Code in the event of ambiguity.\"\n\nIn considering the initial draft of §105, the legislature concluded that the commentary, as revised to reflect legislative changes, should be published as aid to the bench, bar, and others charged with the administration of justice in criminal cases. However, in view of the strong judicial deference given legislative committee reports and other evidence of legislative intent authored by the legislature or its staff, the legislature refrained from adopting the initial commentary accompanying the Judicial Council's Proposed Draft and according it the same status as a legislative work product.\n\nThe Commentary and Supplemental Commentary on the Code are intended to explain the provisions of the Code. The Supplemental Commentary attempts to explain the changes that were made by the legislature to the Proposed Draft of the Hawaii Penal Code (1970) which was prepared under the auspices of the Judicial Council of Hawaii. It also deals with subsequent legislative changes in 1973, 1974 and 1975. The commentaries are designed to give the reader a better understanding of the provisions of the Code. Together they provide an explanation of the considerations involved in the drafting of various sections of the Code. The commentaries also point out the treatment in the Model Penal Code and certain state revisions of provisions the same as or similar to those contained in the Hawaii Penal Code. Finally, the commentaries explain the changes to previous Hawaii law which are brought about by the new Code.\n\nAct 163, Session Laws 1975, amended the section by deleting the requirement that the commentary be published with the Code. The Revisor of Statutes was authorized to publish the commentary in any manner the Revisor deemed would \"promote its basic purpose [as an] aid in understanding the provisions of the Code.\" Conference Committee Report No. 19.\n\nAs an example of judicial use of the Commentary to this Code, see State v. Nobriga, 56 H. 75, 527 P.2d 1269 (1974), a case in which the court was called upon to interpret certain sentencing provisions of chapter 706. The court said that, as the forerunner of the Code, the Commentary to the Hawaii Penal Code (Proposed Draft) (1970) \"sheds some light on the purpose underlying the provision even though it was not intended to be a definitive statement of legislative intent.\" In using the Commentary as an aid in reaching its conclusion, the court said: \"Although it is not considered evidence of legislative intent, we look to the Commentary pertaining to the pre-sentence investigation section in the Penal Code for some understanding of what that section was designed to achieve.\"\n\nCommentary, while not evidence thereof, is expressive of legislative intent. 57 H. 418, 558 P.2d 1012 (1976).\n\nCommentary may be used as aid in understanding the code. 59 H. 92, 576 P.2d 1044 (1978).\n\nCommentary can be looked to as an aid in interpreting the statutory provisions. 61 H. 531, 606 P.2d 920 (1980).",

[L 1980, c 164, pt of §1; gen ch 1985]\n\nRULE 603.1 COMMENTARY\n\nThe intent of this rule, which is similar to Cal. Evid. Code §701, is to complement Rule 601 supra, and to require disqualification of witnesses whose incapacity either to articulate in an understandable fashion or to understand the truthtelling obligation renders their testimony valueless.\n\nUnder this rule the competency of a witness is a matter for determination by the court. Competency has traditionally embodied a level of threshold capacity \"to understand the oath and to perceive, recollect, and communicate that which he is offered to relate.\" Law Revision Comm'n Comment to Cal. Evid. Code §701. Capacity to perceive and to recollect are implicit in Rule 602's personal knowledge requirement. This rule covers the oath and the ability to communicate, matters which may be of concern in cases of youthful or mentally infirm witnesses.\n\nThis rule generally restates existing Hawaii law. A superseded statute, Hawaii Rev. Stat. §621-16 (1976) (repealed 1980) (originally enacted as L 1876, c 32, §50; am L 1972, c 104, §1(k)), provided that the court could \"receive the evidence of any minor; provided, that the evidence of the minor is given upon his affirmation to tell the truth...; provided also, that no such evidence shall in any case be received unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the court ... that the minor perfectly understands the nature and object of the affirmation....\" To the extent that the previous law required a \"perfect\" understanding, the current rule effects a liberalization of the competency standard for children. In Republic v. Ah Wong, 10 H. 524, 525 (1896), the court said: \"There is no precise age within which children are excluded from testifying. Their competency is to be determined, not by their age, but by the degree of their knowledge and understanding.\"\n\nIn Territory v. Titcomb, 34 H. 499, 502 (1938), the court announced that \"the proper test must always be, does the lunatic understand what he is saying, and does he understand the obligation of an oath?.... [I]f he can stand the test proposed, the jury must determine all the rest.\" Rule 603.1 is consistent with the Ah Wong and Titcomb decisions.\n\nIssue of complainant's competency to testify was reasonably called into question, and trial court committed plain error in failing to engage in independent inquiry and make an express finding as to whether complainant was competent to testify before allowing complainant's substantive testimony to be exposed to jury; supreme court not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that error harmless. 74 H. 479, 849 P.2d 58 (1993).\n\nTestimonial capacity of mentally defective person. 5 H.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nCross References\n\nPhysician-patient privilege, psychologist-client privilege, see §626-1, rules 504 and 504.1.\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §704-416\n\nThe Code takes the position that statements made by the defendant to an examiner in the course of an examination under this chapter should be admissible in penal proceedings on the issue of the defendant's physical or mental condition notwithstanding any privilege which might be imported from the law of evidence.[1] However, \"to safeguard the defendant's rights and to make possible the feeling of confidence essential for effective psychiatric [and other medical] diagnosis or treatment, the defendant's statements made for this purpose may not be put in evidence on any other issue,\"[2] e.g., whether the defendant in fact engaged in the proscribed conduct, in penal proceedings.\n\nThe final clause of this section provides that any statement made for the purpose of examination and treatment pursuant to this chapter, which constitutes an admission of guilt of the offense charged, in addition to being inadmissible on other issues, will also not be admissible in evidence on the issue of defendant's mental or physical condition. The intent of the Code is to meet two problems: (1) the inability of a jury to divorce a statement containing an admission of guilt from the determination of all issues, and (2) an objection to the examination of the defendant on the basis of defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.3\n\nError to admit defendant's statement to physician to attack defendant's credibility; cannot be said error harmless. 69 H. 68, 733 P.2d 690 (1987).\n\nOverrides Hawaii rules of evidence rule 702.1. 71 H. 591, 801 P.2d 27 (1990).\n\nStatements not prejudicial where elicited to show declarant's emotional state and no objection made by declarant's counsel. 74 H. 141, 838 P.2d 1374 (1992).\n\nBecause the plain language of this section does not address non-statements, and because an ordinary reading of the statute does not produce an absurd result, this section does not govern non-statements. 116 H. 200, 172 P.3d 512 (2007).\n\nTrial court did not err in permitting prosecution to cross-examine defendant regarding defendant's non-statements to defendant's mental examiners where defendant's failure to mention defendant's concerns regarding aliens was clearly relevant to the question of whether defendant was being truthful when defendant testified at trial about having those concerns at the time of the incident, and this section only addresses the admissibility of defendant's statements, not non-statements; thus, as the introduction of defendant's non-statements did not violate this chapter, defendant's right to a fair trial was not prejudiced by admission of the testimony. 116 H. 200, 172 P.3d 512 (2007).\n\n§704-416 Commentary:\n\n1.

[L 1980, c 164, pt of §1; gen ch 1985; am L 1992, c 191, §2(8)]\n\nRULE 802.1 COMMENTARY\n\nThis rule effects a reorganization of certain of the hearsay provisions found in Article VIII of the federal rules. The formulation follows generally the scheme of Cal. Evid. Code in treating all appropriate prior witness statements in a single rule. The federal rules, in contrast, treat certain prior inconsistent statements, prior consistent statements, and prior identifications as non-hearsay, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1); and place past recorded recollections among the hearsay exceptions for which the availability of the declarant is immaterial, Fed. R. Evid. 803(5).\n\nThis rule should be understood in connection with Rule 613, \"Prior statements of witnesses.\" Rule 613(b) governs the use of prior inconsistent statements for impeachment purposes, and Rule 613(c) governs the use of prior consistent statements for rehabilitation purposes. The present rule, in contrast, defines those prior statements by witnesses that may in addition be considered by the trier of fact to prove the truth of the matters asserted, that is, as exceptions to the hearsay ban of Rule 802.\n\nParagraph (1): At common law all prior inconsistent statements of witnesses were classed as hearsay and thus required instructions limiting consideration to impeachment purposes. Prior Hawaii law was to the same effect, see generally Kekua v. Kaiser Foundation Hosp., 61 H. 208, 601 P.2d 364 (1979). Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) modified the common-law rule to permit one class of inconsistent statements--those \"given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition\"--to be used substantively for the truth of the contents. The present paragraph retains this exempted federal class in paragraph (1)(A) and adds two new classes of inconsistent statements that become exceptions to the hearsay rule, paragraph (1)(B) and (C). The intent is to include in paragraph (1) all written or recorded statements that can fairly be attributed to the witness-declarant. The language of paragraph (1)(A) is virtually identical with Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A); the language of paragraph (1)(B) and (C) is borrowed from the federal \"Jencks Act,\" 18 U.S.C. §3500(e)(1) and (2).\n\nThe \"Jencks Act\" governs the production or discovery, in federal criminal trials, of written or recorded statements made to government agents by government witnesses. Subdivision (e)(1) statements are those \"signed or otherwise adopted or approved\" by a witness. Subdivision (e)(2) statements, although not signed or approved by the witness, are \"substantially verbatim\" written or recorded accounts of oral statements made \"contemporaneously with the making\" of the oral statements. The language of subdivisions (e)(1) and (e)(2) is virtually the same as that of paragraph (1)(B) and (C) of the present rule. The purpose of subdivisions (e)(1) and (e)(2) of the Jencks Act, according to the Supreme Court in Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 349-52 (1959), is to define the \"most trustworthy class of statements\" of witnesses to be turned over to the defense for impeachment purposes. Regarding the requirement that (e)(2) subdivision statements be \"substantially verbatim,\" the court said: \"It is clear that Congress was concerned that only those statements which could properly be called the witness' own words should be made available\" under the Act. Since the purpose of Congress in writing subdivision (e) of the Jencks Act was similar to the legislative intent in adopting paragraph (1)(B) and (C) of the present rule, the Palermo case and other cases construing the Jencks Act, e.g., Williams v. United States, 338 F.2d 286 (D.C. Cir. 1964), will be helpful in defining the parameters of this rule.\n\nThe trustworthiness of statements defined in paragraph (1)(A), (B), and (C) is further assured by the requirement that the witness-declarant be \"subject to cross-examination concerning the subject matter of the statement.\" The situation envisioned is one where the witness has testified about an event and his prior written statement also describes that event but is inconsistent with his testimony. Since the witness can be cross-examined about the event and the statement, the trier of fact is free to credit his present testimony or his prior statement in determining where the truth lies. Because the witness is subject to cross-examination, the substantive use of his prior inconsistent statements does not infringe the sixth amendment confrontation rights of accused in criminal cases, see California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149 (1970).\n\nParagraph (2): Rule 613(c) identifies three classes of prior consistent statements that are admissible for rehabilitation purposes. The present paragraph permits substantive use of these statements. This is consistent with prior Hawaii law, see State v. Altergott, 57 H. 492, 559 P.2d 728 (1977).\n\nParagraph (3): The substantive use of prior identifications is allowed in Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(C), the Advisory Committee's Note to which says: \"The basis is the generally unsatisfactory and inconclusive nature of courtroom identifications as compared with those made at an earlier time under less suggestive conditions.\" Note that this paragraph addresses only the hearsay issue. The use of prior identifications in criminal cases may present constitutional problems as well, see, e.g., Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440 (1969); Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263 (1967).\n\nParagraph (4): This paragraph is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 803(5), and it restates the common-law hearsay exception for recorded recollection, see State v. Altergott, 57 H. 492, 559 P.2d 728 (1977).\n\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\nFamilial Violence and the American Criminal Justice System. 20 UH L. Rev. 375 (1998).\n\nComposite sketch is hearsay but is admissible under prior identification exception if it complies with rule 802.1(3). 66 H. 254, 659 P.2d 745 (1983).\n\nPrior identification exception allows admission of pretrial identifications not merely as corroborative evidence but as substantive proof of identity. 66 H. 254, 659 P.2d 745 (1983).\n\nPrior identification evidence was properly admitted as substantive proof of identity where identifying witness failed to make in-court identification. 72 H. 573, 827 P.2d 648 (1992).\n\nAbuse victim's prior inconsistent statements met requirements under this section for admissibility as substantive evidence of defendant's guilt. 81 H. 131, 913 P.2d 57 (1996).\n\nWife's tape recorded statement to detective properly admitted under paragraph (1)(C) and rule 613(b) as substantive evidence of husband's guilt. 83 H. 289, 926 P.2d 194 (1996).\n\nWhere witness admitted throughout testimony to having made prior oral inconsistent statements, witness' transcribed interview admitted in violation of paragraph (1) and rule 613(b). 91 H. 181, 981 P.2d 1127 (1999).\n\nAdmission into evidence of witness' grand jury testimony under paragraph (4) did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confrontation where witness' testimony was supported by numerous guarantees of trustworthiness and defendant was able to cross-examine witness on witness' subsequent failure to remember alleged incident. 92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959 (1999).\n\nAdmission into evidence of witness' handwritten statement on the bottom of an identification form under paragraph (4) did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confrontation where witness' statement was supported by numerous guarantees of trustworthiness. 92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959 (1999).\n\nWhere prior inconsistent statements were properly admitted under paragraph (1)(C) and witnesses were cross-examined with respect to their statements, substantive use of statements did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confrontation. 92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959 (1999).\n\nAlthough recitation by complainant of police report describing the cell phone text messages would have been inadmissible hearsay under paragraph (4) and rule 803(b)(8), where complainant could recall substantial details about the messages prior to reading the report, which suggested that complainant possessed a memory of the messages that only needed refreshment via the report, complainant properly testified about the text messages after viewing the police report pursuant to rule 612. 117 H. 127, 176 P.3d 885 (2008).\n\nAppeals court correctly concluded that witness' statement was admissible as a past recollection recorded under paragraph (4) where witness testified that witness remembered the incident, that the statement was in witness' writing, contained witness €™ signature, and that witness wrote the report the day following the incident. 127 H. 91, 276 P.3d 660 (2012).\n\nNo merit to State's argument that complainant's videotaped statements were admissible into evidence as exception to hearsay rule under paragraph (2), where complainant was never subjected to cross-examination concerning statements and statements could not be offered into evidence under rule 613(c). 9 H. App. 414, 844 P.2d 1 (1992).\n\nComplainant's prior inconsistent statement inadmissible where record failed to establish that complainant was \"subject to cross-examination concerning the subject matter of the statement\" pursuant to this rule. 80 H. 469 (App.), 911 P.2d 104 (1996).\n\nDeclarant's signed, written prior statement properly admitted under paragraph (1) where statement was offered in compliance with rule 613(b), declarant was subject to cross-examination concerning subject matter of prior statement, and statement was inconsistent with declarant's testimony. 84 H. 203 (App.), 932 P.2d 340 (1997).\n\nAn uncorroborated prior inconsistent statement of a family or household member offered under rule 613 and this rule as substantive evidence of the facts stated therein may be sufficient, if believed, to establish physical abuse and the manner in which such abuse was inflicted in a prosecution for physical abuse of a family or household member under §709-906. 84 H. 253 (App.), 933 P.2d 90 (1997).\n\nWhile the requirement that \"the declarant is subject to cross-examination concerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement\" is foundational under paragraph (2), it is not a requirement under rule 613(c); thus, while social worker's recounting of the allegation of sexual assault made by victim during an unrecorded interview may not have been admissible for its substance under paragraph (2), it was admissible to rehabilitate the victim's credibility under rule 613(c). 103 H. 373 (App.), 82 P.3d 818 (2003).\n\nHearsay testimony of officer properly admitted under paragraph (3); there is no requirement that a declarant vouch for the accuracy of a hearsay statement attributed to the declarant in order to qualify as an exception to hearsay under paragraph (3). 104 H. 285 (App.), 88 P.3d 657 (2004).\n\nWhere record showed that (1) complainant testified on direct examination about the incidents involving defendant; (2) parts of the testimony were inconsistent with portions of complainant's first statement; (3) complainant admitted on cross-examination that complainant wrote the first statement and signed it; and (4) the prior inconsistent statements were offered in compliance with the foundational requirements of rule 613(b), trial court erred in failing to admit as substantive evidence at trial pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) portions of complainant's first statement that were inconsistent with complainant's testimony at trial. 116 H. 403 (App.), 173 P.3d 550 (2007).\n\nMentioned: 74 H. 85, 839 P.2d 10 (1992).",
