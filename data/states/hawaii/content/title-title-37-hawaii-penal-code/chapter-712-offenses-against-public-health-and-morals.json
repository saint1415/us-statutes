Yet the trend of modern thought on prostitution in this country is that \"public policy\" demands that the criminal law go on record against prostitution.[1] Defining this \"public policy\" is a difficult task. Perhaps it more correctly ought to be considered and termed \"public demand\"--a widespread community attitude which the penal law must take into account regardless of the questionable rationales upon which it is based.\n\nA number of reasons have been advanced for the suppression of prostitution, the most often repeated of which are: \"the prevention of disease, the protection of innocent girls from exploitation, and the danger that more sinister activities may be financed by the gains from prostitution.\"[2] These reasons are not convincing. Venereal disease is not prevented by laws attempting to suppress prostitution. If exploitation were a significant factor, the offense could be dealt with solely in terms of coercion. Legalizing prostitution would decrease the prostitute's dependence upon and connection with the criminal underworld and might decrease the danger that \"organized crime\" might be financed in part by criminally controlled prostitution.\n\nOur study of public attitude in this area revealed the widespread belief among those interviewed that prostitution should be suppressed entirely or that it should be so restricted as not to offend those members of society who do not wish to consort with prostitutes or to be affronted by them. Making prostitution a criminal offense is one method of controlling the scope of prostitution and thereby protecting those segments of society which are offended by its open existence. This \"abolitionist\" approach is not without its vociferous detractors. There are those that contend that the only honest and workable approach to the problem is to legalize prostitution and confine it to certain localities within a given community. While such a proposal may exhibit foresight and practicality, the fact remains that a large segment of society is not presently willing to accept such a liberal approach. Recognizing this fact and the need for public order, the Code makes prostitution and its associate enterprises criminal offenses.\n\nThis section makes the offense of prostitution contingent on the commission by a male or female of at least one of three acts: (1) engaging in sexual conduct with another person for a fee, or (2) agreeing to engage in sexual conduct with another person for a fee, or (3) an offer to engage in sexual conduct with another person for a fee. Under this section the sex of the parties or prospective parties is immaterial. It is no defense under this section that: (a) both parties were of the same sex, or (b) the party who accepted, agreed to accept, or solicited the fee was a male and the party who tendered or agreed or offered to tender the fee was a female. To emphasize the immateriality of the sex of the parties, the phrase \"he or she\" is used for the actor in subsection (1), albeit under chapter 701 \"he\" includes any natural person. The word \"person\" is also used in order to denote either the masculine or feminine gender as the particular case demands.\n\nSubsection (2) defines \"sexual conduct.\" As used in subsection (1) it is given a wide scope, meaning \"sexual intercourse,\" \"deviate sexual intercourse,\" or \"sexual contact,\" as those terms are defined in §707-700. Subsection (3) provides that the offense is a petty misdemeanor.\n\nThe Code's provision on prostitution is similar to previous Hawaii law insofar as it applies to both male and female prostitution.[3] However, unlike prior law, the Code does not cover indiscriminate sexual intercourse without hire.[4] Instead of the vague word \"lewdness,\"5 the Code gains some specificity by employing statutorily defined phrases. In the area of penalty, previous law imposed a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both. The Code lowers these maxima to $500 and 30 days, respectively, by making the offense a petty misdemeanor. This has been done on the recommendation of some judges and with the concurrence of the Honolulu Police Department. Since the sentences presently imposed do not, in fact, generally exceed those authorized for a petty misdemeanor, the Code is in accord with present practice.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §712-1200\n\nAct 110, Session Laws 1981, added subsection (4) to specify the sentencing alternatives upon conviction of a defendant. The legislature felt that some form of mandatory sentence was necessary to curb prostitution and the attendant crimes of violence and crimes against property. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 15, House Conference Committee Report No. 25.\n\nAct 204, Session Laws 1990, amended this section to clarify that the customer of a prostitute would also be committing the crime of prostitution. The legislature felt that buyers and sellers of illegal business transactions should be targets for prosecution. House Standing Committee Report No. 1205-90.\n\nAct 130, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to permit deferred pleas under chapter 853 in first-offense prostitution cases and to prohibit expungement pursuant to §831-3.2 until four years following discharge. The Act also provided that a plea previously entered by a defendant under §853-1 for prostitution is considered a prior offense. Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\nAct 177, Session Laws 1998, amended this section to provide that any offense for which a person is convicted of prostitution is probationable, and that the court may impose prostitution intervention classes for only one term of probation. The legislature found that prostitution was a multi-faceted problem which required efforts to encourage persons involved in the sex industry to seek alternative lifestyles and employment options. The legislature further found that persons involved in prostitution were often not capable of exploring those options, and thus, those persons needed assistance in finding educational and employment opportunities that would support their desire to leave prostitution. Conference Committee Report No. 155.\n\nAct 145, Session Laws 2011, amended this section by extending the offense of prostitution to include those who pay, agree to pay, or offer to pay a fee to another person to engage in sexual conduct. Conference Committee Report No. 76.\n\nAct 216, Session Laws 2012, amended the language in subsection (4) that established a mandatory fine of $1,000 for the commission of the first and any subsequent offense of prostitution to establish instead a minimum fine of $500 for the commission of the first and any subsequent offense of prostitution. Conference Committee Report No. 109-12.\n\nAct 247, Session Laws 2013, amended this section to clarify the minimum and maximum fine for a person convicted of committing the offense of prostitution. Conference Committee Report No. 64.\n\nAct 114, Session Laws 2014, amended subsection (2) by adding sadomasochistic abuse as an element of the offense of prostitution. Act 114 also amended subsection (5) by clarifying that the law enforcement exemption from the offense of prostitution excludes acts of sadomasochistic abuse and sexual penetration. The legislature believed that it was unnecessary for a law enforcement officer to engage in sexual intercourse in order to make an arrest for prostitution because it is the financial transaction that makes the act illegal under the offense of prostitution. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3249, Conference Committee Report No. 41-14.\n\nAct 206, Session Laws 2016, amended this section, among others, to establish a victim and survivor-centered approach to comprehensive anti-sex trafficking laws. Specifically, Act 206 amended this section by: (1) establishing a class C felony for the act of paying for sex in reckless disregard of the fact that the other person is a victim of sex trafficking; and (2) specifying that when a minor under the age of eighteen commits the act of engaging in or offering to engage in sexual conduct with another person for a fee, it is not a criminal offense, but rather a violation that subjects the minor to the jurisdiction of the family court. The legislature found that the existing laws relating to prostitution and promoting prostitution may not have been suitable to address certain circumstances in which coercion or other inability to consent is present. Act 206 allowed Hawaii to join other states that had adopted comprehensive anti-sex trafficking legislation. Conference Committee Report No. 147-16, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3450.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (1) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 176, Session Laws 2019, amended this section to decrease from four to three years the period of time that a person is required to wait before applying to expunge a deferred plea to a prostitution charge. The legislature found that by helping trafficking victims to clear their criminal records, Act 176 would support victims in reintegrating into society and finding non-exploitative employment, bring about substantial cultural reform, and send a strong message that a person's participation in prostitution is often complex and should not bar access to resources, safety, and compassion. Conference Committee Report No. 53, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 786.\n\nAct 68, Session Laws 2021, amended this section to: (1) remove from the scope of the offense of prostitution, the act of paying another to engage in sexual conduct, which was reestablished under Act 68 as the separate offense of commercial sexual exploitation; (2) provide that the compensation for engaging in sexual conduct includes anything of value; (3) clarify the discretion of courts to convert the unpaid portion of a fine to community service; (4) repeal provisions pertaining to prostitution intervention classes for probationers; and (5) clarify that the exemption for law enforcement officers applies to those engaging in undercover operations and that under no circumstances does sexual contact initiated by a law enforcement officer, sexual penetration, or sadomasochistic abuse fall within the course and scope of duties. The legislature found that sex trafficking is an ever-evolving criminal enterprise in which traffickers and exploiters find various means to sexually exploit the most vulnerable in the community. The legislature further found that protecting victims from sexual exploitation and holding offenders accountable is difficult given the disparity in power between the victims and perpetrators, and that amending Hawaii's sex trafficking laws to better reflect the current reality and challenges would improve outcomes for trafficking victims and survivors.

App. 165, 827 P.2d 1156 (1992).\n\nWhether the men responded to defendant's offers and the substance of their responses were irrelevant under prostitution statute; defendant merely had to offer to engage in sex in exchange for a fee. There was substantial evidence for trial judge to find that defendant offered to engage in sexual conduct in exchange for money. 79 H. 123 (App.), 899 P.2d 406 (1995).\n\nAs court had no discretion under subsection (4)(b) in imposing stiffer sentence on defendant once it was established that defendant was a subsequent prostitution offender, defendant was not required to raise a good-faith challenge to the prior conviction in order to trigger the State's burden to prove that defendant was represented by counsel or waived such representation at the time of defendant's prior conviction. 89 H. 492 (App.), 974 P.2d 1082 (1998).\n\nWhere officer testified to a prior arrest of defendant, defendant admitted to prior arrest by officer, trial court was able to evaluate and match physical identifying information in criminal history abstract with defendant, abstract set out the prior prostitution conviction of a defendant with the same name, and defendant had rather unusual name for person in Hawaii, evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had a prior prostitution conviction for purposes of subsection (4). 89 H. 492 (App.), 974 P.2d 1082 (1998).\n\nAs the First Amendment does not protect speech which is part of a course of criminal conduct, and defendant's words were an integral part of defendant's conduct in violating a valid statute prohibiting offers or agreements to engage in sex for a fee (this section), defendant's prosecution did not violate the First Amendment. 107 H. 360 (App.), 113 P.3d 811 (2005).\n\nThis section does not proscribe constitutionally protected conduct and was not overbroad as applied to defendant's actual conduct; the language of this section also was sufficiently clear that defendant was not required to guess at its meaning, this section gave defendant fair warning that defendant was prohibited from offering or agreeing to engage in sex for a fee. 107 H. 360 (App.), 113 P.3d 811 (2005).\n\nTrial court's factual findings pertaining to defendant's offer and agreement to engage in sex for $200 were not clearly erroneous and there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's prostitution conviction under this section. 107 H. 360 (App.), 113 P.3d 811 (2005).\n\n§711-1200 Commentary:\n\n1.

The real danger presented by this class of people is that its members have a motive to coerce women or men into prostitution. Through their promotion of prostitution activities they magnify the extent to which prostitution is practiced. Aside from coercion into and the promotion of prostitution, these promoters often gain a vicious hold over the prostitutes under their control.\n\nSection 712-1201 defines the types of conduct which are the gravamen of the offense of promoting prostitution. These types of conduct are termed \"advancing prostitution\" and \"profiting from prostitution.\" The sections following, § §712-1202, 1203, and 1204, delineate various degrees of the offense of promoting prostitution.\n\nPromoting prostitution in the first degree, as defined by §712-1202, is the most serious offense in this trilogy. The aggravating circumstances are the criminal coercion of the prostitute or the young age of the prostitute. The offense is a class B felony.\n\nSection 712-1203, promoting prostitution in the second degree, deals with two less serious aggravating circumstances in this type of activity: (a) advancing or profiting by operating or owning a house of prostitution or a prostitution business or enterprise involving prostitution by two or more prostitutes, or (b) advancing or profiting from prostitution of a person less than 18 years of age. This section provides penalties against the \"madam\" of a house of prostitution, those persons who run and control \"call girl rings\", and lessors and owners of real property who knowingly rent or permit premises to be used for prostitution purposes. It also penalizes those who take under their control for prostitution purposes girls under the age of 18 years. Promoting prostitution in the second degree is made a class C felony.\n\nSection 712-1204 defines the offense of promoting prostitution in the third degree, that is, knowingly advancing or profiting from prostitution. This section strikes at the small scale promoter. The taxicab driver who pimps for a prostitute, the bartender who sets up customers for a prostitute, and the hotel clerk who regularly furnishes the prostitute and his or her customer with accommodations would all come within the ambit of this provision. Of course, if any of the aggravating attendant circumstances previously discussed exist, § §712-1202 or 1203 would apply. Promoting prostitution in the third degree is a misdemeanor.\n\nThe previous law dealt both with the criminal coercion of a person to become a prostitute as well as what is commonly referred to as \"procuring\" a person for the practice of prostitution.1 The sanction provided was roughly equivalent to a class C felony. These sections also consider other factors, namely the youth of the prostitute and the number of prostitutes involved in the operation. In addition, it provides for three degrees of the offense; the highest degree, presenting the most serious aggravations, is made a class B felony, a more severe sanction than that provided by prior law. The least serious case, promotion in the third degree, is a misdemeanor, the same sanction provided for what was previously termed \"soliciting.\" The best that can be said for the former statutes in this area is that they were inartfully drawn. They probably bordered on vagueness which may have been unconstitutional. The Code achieves greater clarity than the previous law and provides for sanctions which are more realistically addressed to the circumstances involved in the offenses.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §712-1201 TO 712-1204\n\nAct 130, Session Laws 1993, amended §712-1202 to raise, from fourteen to sixteen, the age of exploited minors that would subject a perpetrator to a first degree charge for the offense of promoting prostitution. The Act also amended § §712-1202 and 712-1203 to make the language in these sections gender neutral. The legislature found that there was a need to enlarge the scope of persons subject to increased criminal penalties for promoting teen-age prostitution. Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\nAct 147, Session Laws 2008, amended §712-1202 by adding a reference to \"force, threat, or intimidation\" and deleting \"criminal coercion.\" Act 147 also applied the offense to a person who knowingly advances or profits from prostitution of a person less than eighteen, rather than sixteen, years old. The legislature strengthened the laws on prostitution and related offenses to deter and punish sexual exploitation of minors, including obscenity-related activities. Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.\n\nAct 147, Session Laws 2008, amended §712-1203(1) by adding a reference to \"prostituted persons.\" Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.\n\nAct 145, Session Laws 2011, amended §712-1201 by making conforming and nonsubstantive amendments.\n\nAct 145, Session Laws 2011, amended §712-1202 by adding inducing a person to act by specified means and including the use of fraud as elements of promoting prostitution in the first degree. Act 145 also increased the penalty for the offense to a class A felony. Conference Committee Report No. 76.\n\nAct 145, Session Laws 2011, repealed §712-1204, promoting prostitution in the third degree, and amended §712-1203, promoting prostitution in the second degree, by incorporating conduct previously prohibited under §712-1204 within the second degree offense. Act 145 increased the penalty for the second degree offense to a class B felony. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1137, Conference Committee Report No. 76.\n\nAct 206, Session Laws 2016, amended §712-1201 by amending the section heading to conform to amendments made to other sections in the Hawaii Revised Statutes by Act 206.\n\nAct 206, Session Laws 2016, amended §712-1202, among others, to establish a victim and survivor-centered approach to comprehensive anti-sex trafficking laws. Specifically, Act 206 amended §712-1202 by: (1) replacing the offense of promoting prostitution in the first degree with sex trafficking, a class A felony and violent crime; and (2) specifying that the offense of sex trafficking requires proof of negligence with respect to the victim's age when the victim of sex trafficking is under eighteen years of age. The legislature found that the existing laws relating to prostitution and promoting prostitution may not have been suitable to address certain circumstances in which coercion or other inability to consent is present. Act 206 allowed Hawaii to join other states that had adopted comprehensive anti-sex trafficking legislation. Conference Committee Report No. 147-16, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3450.\n\nAct 206, Session Laws 2016, amended §712-1203 to change the offense of promoting prostitution in the second degree to the offense of promoting prostitution. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3450.\n\nAct 68, Session Laws 2021, amended §712-1201 to: (1) amend the definition of \"profits from prostitution\" to include the acceptance or receipt of anything of value to participate in the proceeds of prostitution activity; and (2) specify that the definitions in this section do not include the conduct of prostituted persons under §712-1200 or persons engaged in commercial sexual exploitation under §712-1200.5. Act 68 also amended §712-1202 to: (1) specify that sex trafficking includes advancing or profiting from prostitution through coercion; and (2) make a person strictly liable for sex trafficking of a minor in terms of the victim €™s age. The legislature found that sex trafficking is an ever-evolving criminal enterprise in which traffickers and exploiters find various means to sexually exploit the most vulnerable in the community. The legislature further found that protecting victims from sexual exploitation and holding offenders accountable is difficult given the disparity in power between the victims and perpetrators, and that amending Hawaii's sex trafficking laws to better reflect the current reality and challenges would improve outcomes for trafficking victims and survivors.

The term of imprisonment shall be imposed immediately, regardless of whether the defendant appeals the conviction, except as provided in subsection (5).\n\n(5) As an option to the mandatory term of thirty days imprisonment, if the court finds the option is warranted based upon the defendant's record, the court may place the defendant on probation for a period not to exceed six months, subject to the mandatory condition that the defendant observe geographic restrictions that prohibit the defendant from entering or remaining on public property, in Waikiki and other areas in the State designated by county ordinance during the hours from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Upon any violation of the geographic restrictions by the defendant, the court, after hearing, shall revoke the defendant's probation and immediately impose the mandatory thirty-day term of imprisonment. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the imposition of stricter geographic restrictions under section 706-624(2)(h).\n\n(6) Any person charged under this section may be admitted to bail, pursuant to section 804-4, subject to the mandatory condition that the person observe geographic restrictions that prohibit the defendant from entering or remaining on public property, in Waikiki and other areas in the State designated by county ordinance during the hours from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any person who violates these bail restrictions shall have the person's bail revoked after hearing and shall be imprisoned forthwith. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the imposition of stricter geographic restrictions under section 804-7.1.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a police officer, without warrant, may arrest any person when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed a violation of subsection (5) or (6), and the person shall be detained, without bail, until the hearing under the appropriate subsection can be held, which hearing shall be held as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\n(8) For purposes of this section:\n\n\"Area\" means any zone within a county that is defined with specific boundaries and designated as a zone of significant prostitution by this section or a county ordinance.\n\n\"Public property\" includes any street, highway, road, sidewalk, alley, lane, bridge, parking lot, park, or other property owned or under the jurisdiction of any governmental entity or otherwise open to the public.\n\n\"Sexual conduct\" has the same meaning as in section 712-1200(2).\n\n\"Waikiki\" means that area of Oahu bounded by the Ala Wai canal, the ocean, and Kapahulu avenue.\n\n(9) This section shall apply to all counties; provided that if a county enacts an ordinance to regulate street prostitution and commercial sexual exploitation, other than an ordinance designating an area as a zone of significant prostitution-related activity, the county ordinance shall supersede this section and no person shall be convicted under this section in that county. [L 1998, c 149, §2; am L 2000, c 143, §1; am L 2011, c 145, §8; am L 2021, c 68, §7]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §712-1207\n\nAct 149, Session Laws 1998, added this section to require that as a mandatory condition of probation and bail, defendants are to observe geographic restrictions prohibiting them from entering or walking on the public streets or sidewalks of Waikiki during the hours from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Defendants that live in Waikiki and choose to remain in Waikiki during the prohibited hours are required to stay off the streets and sidewalks during those hours. The legislature believed that although the restriction covered a large physical space, it was narrowly tailored to cover only the hours most closely associated with the crime. Also, the restriction was sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice of the behavior that is prohibited. Act 149 also allowed the counties to enact ordinances regulating street solicitation that shall supersede the provisions of this section. Conference Committee Report No. 83.\n\nAct 143, Session Laws 2000, amended this section by expanding the prohibition of street solicitation of prostitution from Waikiki to other areas designated by the council of the appropriate county, but to not more than four areas of the State. The legislature found that allowing counties to designate additional areas as \"prostitution-free zones\" could provide counties with a way to address the proliferation of prostitution beyond the Waikiki area. This Act also provided for the denial of bail to those persons arrested for violating the terms of bail or probation upon entering the prohibited designated areas. Conference Committee Report No. 72.\n\nAct 145, Session Laws 2011, amended this section by extending the offense of solicitation of prostitution to include those who pay, agree to pay, or offer to pay a fee to another person to engage in sexual conduct. Conference Committee Report No. 76.\n\nAct 68, Session Laws 2021, amended this section to: (1) rename the offense to reference commercial sexual exploitation; and (2) provide that the compensation for engaging in sexual conduct includes anything of value.

The legislature further found that protecting victims from sexual exploitation and holding offenders accountable is difficult given the disparity in power between the victims and perpetrators, and that amending Hawaii's sex trafficking laws to better reflect the current reality and challenges would improve outcomes for trafficking victims and survivors. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1654, Conference Committee Report No. 45.\n\nBy the express terms of subsections (4) and (5), the offense of street solicitation under subsection (1) is probationable, and thus not excludable under §853-4(5); appeals court therefore erred in affirming trial court's refusal to consider defendant's motion for a deferred acceptance of no contest plea. 116 H. 519, 174 P.3d 358 (2007).\n\nBased on the clear and unambiguous language of this section, the offense of street solicitation of prostitution can only be committed by the person who offers or agrees to engage in sexual conduct with another person in a prohibited area \"in return for a fee\"; thus it is only the recipient of the fee, and not the payor of the fee, who can commit the offense. 120 H. 478 (App.), 210 P.3d 1 (2009).",

      "text": "§712-1209.6 Prostitution; motion to vacate conviction.(1) A person convicted of committing the offense of prostitution under section 712-1200, loitering for the purpose of engaging in or advancing prostitution under section 712-1206(2), street prostitution and commercial sexual exploitation in designated areas under section 712-1207(1)(a) or (2)(a), or convicted of a lesser offense when originally charged with a violation of section 712-1200, 712-1206(2), or 712-1207(1)(a) or (2)(a), may file a motion to vacate the conviction if the defendant is not subsequently convicted of any offense under the Hawaii Penal Code within three years after the date of the original conviction.\n\n(2) The court shall hold a hearing on a motion filed under this section to review the defendant's record over the three years after the date of the original conviction under section 712-1200, 712-1206(2), or 712-1207(1)(a) or (2)(a) or conviction of a lesser offense when originally charged with a violation of any of those sections, and if the court finds that the defendant has not been convicted of any offense under the Hawaii Penal Code within this three year period, the court shall vacate the conviction.

The legislature found that human trafficking, consisting of the subjugation, recruitment, harboring, or transportation of people for the purpose of forced labor or services, or commercial sexual exploitation, was one of the fastest growing criminal industries. Act 216 would assist in combating human trafficking by allowing trafficking victims who were forced into prostitution to file a motion to have their prostitution convictions vacated from their records. Conference Committee Report No. 109-12.\n\nAct 35, Session Laws 2015, amended subsection (1)(b) by changing: (1) the phrase \"severe form of trafficking\" to \"severe form of trafficking in persons\"; and (2) \"title 22 United States Code section 7102(13)\" to \"title 22 United States Code section 7102(9)(A).\"\n\nAct 206, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to conform to amendments made to other sections in the Hawaii Revised Statutes by Act 206. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3450.\n\nAct 176, Session Laws 2019, amended this section to permit persons convicted of certain prostitution offenses to file a motion to vacate the conviction if the defendant is not convicted of another offense under the Penal Code within three years of the original prostitution conviction. The legislature found that sex trafficking victims are often misidentified and criminalized by law enforcement and that, although the existing law allowed sex trafficking victims to vacate prostitution convictions by proving their victimization within six years from the time that victimization ceased, trafficking victims may face significant challenges in disclosing and proving their victimization. The legislature noted that persons who have been convicted of certain prostitution offenses, regardless of whether they have been or can allege that they were victims of sex trafficking, should be able to vacate their convictions after a reasonable period of three years from the date of conviction; provided that these persons have maintained a clean record free of convictions under the Penal Code during that period of time. The legislature found that by helping trafficking victims to clear their criminal records, Act 176 would support victims in reintegrating into society and finding non-exploitative employment, bring about substantial cultural reform, and send a strong message that a person's participation in prostitution is often complex and should not bar access to resources, safety, and compassion. Conference Committee Report No. 53, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 786.\n\nAct 68, Session Laws 2021, made conforming amendments to this section to reflect the following amendments made under Act 68: (1) the removal from the scope of the offense of prostitution under §712-1200, of the act of paying another to engage in sexual conduct, which was reestablished under Act 68 as the separate offense of commercial sexual exploitation; and (2) the renaming of the offense under §712-1207 to \"street prostitution and commercial sexual exploitation.\" The legislature found that sex trafficking is an ever-evolving criminal enterprise in which traffickers and exploiters find various means to sexually exploit the most vulnerable in the community. The legislature further found that protecting victims from sexual exploitation and holding offenders accountable is difficult given the disparity in power between the victims and perpetrators, and that amending Hawaii's sex trafficking laws to better reflect the current reality and challenges would improve outcomes for trafficking victims and survivors.

It also amended the definitions of \"pornographic\" and \"pornographic to minors.\" The conference committee stated in its report (Senate Conference Committee Report No. 14 and House Conference Committee Report No. 12) that the amendments were merely to conform the definitions to the holdings of the United States Supreme Court in Miller v.

This section already provided a sufficient definition of \"sexual conduct.\" House Standing Committee Report No. 1281.\n\nAct 16, Session Laws 2016, amended this section by amending the definition of the term \"sexual conduct\" as that term is used in the penal code for offenses related to obscenity, by removing unnecessary and archaic language regarding sexual orientation. House Standing Committee Report No. 1124-16.\n\nAct 95, Session Laws 2018, amended the definition of \"pornographic for minors\" by clarifying that a material or performance is not required to appeal specifically to the minor's prurient interest in order to be found pornographic for minors. The legislature found that one element of the definition of pornographic material in general is that it appeals to the prurient interest. However, in some cases regarding material that is pornographic to minors, a minor may be exposed to material before the minor is of sufficient age to have developed prurient interests.

Although nudity and near-nudity now have gained wide acceptance, many people would be affronted by a public display of the sort here pro ­hibited. The precedent for regulating public display is well established. Mr. Justice Brennan has commented,\n\nI may say that whatever theory of the first amendment's scope is championed, all schools of thought ... are in substantial agree ­ment ... that government has some power to regulate the \"how\" and \"where\" of the exercise of the freedom; government is not powerless to say that you cannot blare by loudspeaker the words of the rust amend ­ment in a residential neighborhood in the dead of night, or litter the streets with copies of the text. In other words, though the speech itself be under the first amendment, the manner of its exercise or its collateral aspects may fall beyond the scope of the amendment.[1]\n\nAnd Mr. Justice Stewart, after underscoring the sanctity of freedom of expression, remarked in his Ginsburg dissent that:\n\nDifferent constitutional questions would arise in a case involving an assault upon individual privacy by publication in a man ­ner so blatant or obtrusive as to make it difficult or impossible for an unwilling indi ­vidual to avoid exposure to it.2\n\nDisplaying indecent matter is a petty misde ­meanor. This relatively light penalty is based on the small amount of harm done, but it is thought desir ­able to have a brief jail sentence available as an unpleasant reminder that society does not favor such conduct. The section requires the mental state of knowledge or recklessness as a minimum basis for prosecution. Thus negligence would be insuffi ­cient. This is in accord with United States Supreme Court case law in the area of dissemination of obscene books? The area of prohibited display is limited to areas which the general public cannot avoid if affronted by the display. Thus it is not as broad as the definition of \"public place\" in §711 ­-1100(2).\n\nSection 712-1211 contains special requirements that the display be presented in such a manner as to exploit lust and that it be utterly without redeeming social importance. Arguably neither requirement is constitutionally necessary because of the limited area of prohibition, but particularly since certain works of art would otherwise be included it seems wise to include such a limitation on liability.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §712-1211\n\nAct 106, Session Laws 1981, amended subsection (1)(c) to conform to the revised definition of \"pornographic\" in §712-1210.\n\n§712-1211 Commentary:\n\n1.

In Roth the Court applied \"contemporary community standards\" to the predominant appeal test.[5] In Memoirs, the Court applied \"contemporary community standards\" to the limits of candor test,[6] but not to the predominant appeal test.[7] In Ginzburg the Court applied the concept of community standards in determining whether the material had social value for the audience (general public) to which it was directed.[8] It should, however, be noted that the Court in Ginzburg was sharply divided and that in most decisions the applications of \"contemporary community standards\" has been only to the predominant appeal and limits of candor tests.\n\nThe most serious problem in the application of \"contemporary community standards\" is the uncertain nature and size of the \"community\" referred to. On this too, the Court is divided. Mr. Justice Harlan has said:\n\nThere must first be decided the relevant \"community\" in terms of whose standards of decency the issue must be judged. We think that the proper test under this federal statute, reaching as it does to all parts of the United States whose population reflects many different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, is a national standard of decency. We need not decide whether Congress could constitutionally prescribe a lesser geographical framework for judging this issue which would not have the intolerable consequence of denying some sections of the country access to material, there deemed acceptable, which in others might be considered offensive to prevailing community standards of decency. Cf. Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380.[9]\n\nThis \"national community\" standard has been echoed by Mr. Justice Brennan:\n\nWe do not see how any \"local\" definition of the \"community\" could properly be employed in delineating the area of expression that is protected by the Federal Constitution. ...It is true that Manual Enterprises dealt with the federal statute banning obscenity from the mails. But the mails are not the only means by which works of expression cross local community lines in this country. It can hardly be assumed that all the patrons of a particular library, bookstand, or motion picture theater are residents of the smallest local \"community\" that can be drawn around that establishment. Furthermore, to sustain the suppression of a particular book or film in one locality would deter its dissemination in other localities where it might be held not obscene, since sellers and exhibitors would be reluctant to risk criminal conviction in testing the variation between the two places....\n\nIt is true that local communities throughout the land are in fact diverse, and that in cases such as this one the Court is confronted with the task of reconciling the rights of such communities with the rights of individuals. Communities vary, however, in many respects other than their toleration of alleged obscenity, and such variances have never been considered to require or justify a varying standard for application of the Federal Constitution. The Court has regularly been compelled, in reviewing the criminal convictions challenged under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to reconcile the conflicting rights of the local community which brought the prosecution and of the individual defendant. Such a task is admittedly difficult and delicate, but it is inherent in the Court's duty of determining whether a particular conviction worked a deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. The Court has not shrunk from discharging that duty in other areas, and we see no reason why it should do so here. The Court has explicitly refused to tolerate a result whereby \"the constitutional limits of free expression in the Nation would vary with state lines,\" Pennekamp v. Florida, supra, 328 U.S., at 335; we see even less justification for allowing such limits to vary with town or county lines. We thus reaffirm the position taken in Roth to the effect that the constitutional status of an allegedly obscene work must be determined on the basis of a national standard. It is, after all, a national Constitution we are expounding.[10]\n\nOn the other hand, former Chief Justice Warren, dissenting in Jacobellis, thought the standard should be the \"local\" community:\n\nIt is my belief that when the Court said in Roth that obscenity is to be defined by reference to \"community standards,\" it meant community standards not a national standard, as is sometimes argued. I believe that there is no provable \"national standard,\" and perhaps there should be none. At all events, this Court has not been able to enunciate one, and it would be unreasonable to expect local courts to divine one. It is said that such a \"community\" approach may well result in material being proscribed as obscene in one community but not in another, and, in all probability, that is true. But communities throughout the Nation are in fact diverse, and it must be remembered that, in cases such as this one, the Court is confronted with the task of reconciling conflicting rights of the diverse communities within our society and of individuals.[11]\n\nThe disagreement within the Court is all the more difficult to understand because the standard provided in Roth, Manual Enterprises, Jacobellis, Memoirs, Mishkin, and other cases, was derived from the Model Penal Code,[12] which clearly intended that a national standard be applied.[13]\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court's failure to provide a clear rule, the state and lower federal courts have split three ways: applying either a \"local,\"[14] \"state,\"[15] or \"national\"[16] standard.\n\nIt appears to us that there is little to be gained by using the phrase \"contemporary community standards\"--which the Code deliberately does not employ. The reference will have to be made to contemporary standards of ordinary adults--but the use of the word \"community\" in this context has posed more problems than it has solved. It seems that the reference is at least statewide and probably national--but to use the word \"community\" at either level adds little or nothing. In any event, the Code's definition of \"pornographic\" will not prejudice further case development on this issue.\n\nThe Code limits the offense of promoting pornography to activity carried on for monetary consideration. It is commercial exploitation and not private tastes that are the gravamen of the offense. As the drafters of the Michigan proposed revision have pointed out:\n\n... [T]he emphasis in this area should be on commercial distribution of pornographic material. We should not open up to prosecution, police investigation, search, etc. every person who in the privacy of his home exhibits pornographic materials to a few friends [cf. Redmond v. United States, 384 U.S. 264, 86 S.Ct. 1415, 16 L.Ed. 2d 521 (1966)].[17]\n\nMoreover, making criminal private possession of materials, and possibly private expressions through performances, albeit pornographic in nature, appears to be unconstitutional.[18]\n\nIt should be pointed out that the definition of the offense provides that the accused must act knowingly with respect to the pornographic context and character of the material the accused disseminates or the performance the accused presents, directs, or in which the accused participates. This meets the constitutionally imposed requirement of mens rea in this type of case[19] and is in accord with the general principles set forth in chapter 702 of this Code.\n\nThe previous Hawaii law relating to pornographic and other condemned publications was set forth in HRS §727-8. No extended discussion is required to demonstrate that this section of the Code is to be preferred to previous law. In line with the Code's limitation to commercial exploitation, the available penalty has been increased.20\n\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\nState v.

It is derived primarily from New York Revised Penal Law §235.21 and its immediate predecessor, New York Penal Law §484(h)--(i). It is based on the State of Hawaii's role as parens patriae, and the duties and powers which attach to that role. One of the most dramatic recognitions of the state's role as parens patriae is found in the United States Supreme Court decision in Prince v. Massachussetts.[1]\n\nThe state's authority over children's activities is broader than over like actions of adults.... A democratic society rests, for its continuance, upon the healthy, well- rounded growth of young people into full maturity as citizens, with all that implies. It may secure this against impeding restraints and dangers within a broad range of selection.... It is too late now to doubt that legislation appropriately designed to reach such evils is within the state's police power....[2]\n\nPrince v. Massachusetts affirmed the right of the state to overrule a parental prerogative for the welfare of the child. There is abundant authority, not only in the statutory law of Hawaii, but also in case law of sister states and most recently, in a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which supports the right of the state to preserve and augment the parental prerogative.\n\nUnder the present Hawaii law alcoholic beverages may not be sold to a person under 18 years of age,[3] cigarettes may not be sold to a person under 15 years of age,[4] and counties are given the option of establishing curfews for minors.[5] These laws attempt to safeguard the prerogative of the parent to decide whether his or her child of a specific age will imbibe, smoke, or stay out past a certain hour.\n\nIn regard to the regulation of dissemination of pornographic material to children, the case law is quite clear. In sustaining the state's power to enact such regulations, the New York Court of Appeals stated in Bookcase, Inc. v. Broderick,[6]\n\n... Material which is protected for distribution to adults is not necessarily constitutionally protected from restriction upon its dissemination to children.... Because of the State's exigent interest in preventing distribution to children of objectionable material, it can exercise its power to protect the health, safety, welfare and morals of its community by barring the distribution to children of books recognized to be suitable for adults.[7]\n\nAn even more cogent recognition of the state's right, and even obligation, to reinforce the parental prerogative is illustrated by Judge Fuld's concurring opinion, People v. Kahan,[8] in which he said:\n\nWhile the supervision of children's reading may best be left to their parents, the knowledge that parental control or guidance cannot always be provided and society's transcendant interest in protecting the welfare of children justify reasonable regulation of the sale of material to them.[9]\n\nIf there were any doubt remaining prior to 1968 of the constitutional validity of prohibiting the dissemination of pornography to minors as a specific class, that doubt was laid to rest by the United States Supreme Court decision in Ginsberg v. New York,[10] handed down April 22, 1968. In that decision the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of New York Penal Law 484(h),[11] a law substantially similar with the proposed section.\n\nTwo aspects of §712-1215 should be noted at the outset.\n\nFirst, this provision is not limited to dissemination for monetary gain. The same approach was taken in Michigan.[12] The reason behind this was a strong feeling that the non-commercial distribution of pornographic material to minors often presented a serious problem, that only rarely did it involve parents or guardians, and that a criminal prosecution in these rare cases was unlikely.[13] To insure that §712-1215 is not employed against parents, guardians, others in loco parentis to the minor, or siblings of the minor, subsection (2) has been provided. The United States Supreme Court has clearly implied in Ginsberg v. New York that a prohibition not limited to commercial distribution, which would put parents in jeopardy of criminal sanctions, would be invalidated. The Court pointedly noted that \"the prohibition against sales to minors does not bar parents who so desire from purchasing the magazines for their children.\"[14] In light of this strong implication an adoption of the Michigan approach demands explicit exception of parents, guardians, etc., from the prohibitions of the law.\n\nSecondly, the Code makes 16 years the appropriate age limit for minors. The choice reflects the desire of the state in its role as parens patriae to keep control over the reading matter of minors as long as is realistically feasible. The age limit is not inconsistent with the low age limits under Chapter 707; rather in that chapter, the rationale behind the choice of ages discussed in the commentary to 707-731 to 735 is primarily and necessarily the physical maturity of the female.\n\nSection 712-1215 contains two prohibitions, each with its own specific emphasis. Subsection (1)(a) prohibits the dissemination to a minor of material which is pornographic for minors. The nature of the material falling within this prohibition is described in the definitions of \"pornographic for minors\" and \"material\" [ §712-1210]. \"Material\" includes not only printed matter, but also records, tapes, still photographs, motion pictures, drawings, or sculptures. Such material is \"pornographic\" if it is primarily devoted to explicit and detailed narrative accounts of specified sexual acts between parties of the same or different sexes or contains a visual representation of naked genitalia or depicting specified sexual acts. The limiting clauses (i) and (ii) in the definition of \"pornographic for minors\" would exclude sex education texts, scientific texts, and most works of art or literature that are not presented in such a manner as to predominantly appeal to a minor's prurient interest or that have a redeeming social importance for minors. Obviously certain marriage manuals would not fit in this category, nor would some works of art or works of literature. By including these two specific requirements the definition clearly identifies itself with former New York Penal Law §484(h) which was validated by the United States Supreme Court in Ginsberg v. New York. Again, it should be pointed out that there is an added safety valve in §712-1215; nothing prevents a parent from buying material for his or her child, regardless of what that material depicts or narrates.\n\nSubsection (1)(a) would also operate against the merchant who allows a minor to page through pornographic material on display. The word \"dissemination\" is defined, in §712-1210, to include an \"offer to sell\" and \"exhibit.\"\n\nSubsection (1)(b) prohibits exhibiting a pornographic motion picture film or other performance to a minor. It also prohibits selling a ticket to a minor for admission to such a movie or other performance or the actual admitting of a minor to such a movie or other performance. Thus the prohibition may reach not only the owner of a movie theater or burlesque house but also the person running the ticket booth as well as the usher who accepts the ticket and admits the minor.\n\nBoth subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) require knowledge of the character and content of the material disseminated or the movie or other performance exhibited. The United States Supreme Court upheld similar knowledge requirements in Smith v. California.[15] Such knowledge requirements were reaffirmed most recently in the Supreme Court's Ginsberg decision.\n\nSubsection (2) makes the promotion of pornographic material for minors a misdemeanor. A fine of $1,000 is available in addition to a one-year term of imprisonment. To the extent that the severity of a penalty has deterrent value, the misdemeanor sanction should suffice.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §712-1215\n\nAct 190, Session Laws 1974, amended subsection (2) by adding the words \"or to a person who commits any act specified therein in his capacity as a member of the staff of any public library.\" The change was \"to make clear that a person who, in his or her capacity as a member of a staff of a public library, disseminates to a minor, material which is subsequently held to be 'pornographic for minors' is not guilty of a penal offense.\" Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1072-74.\n\nAct 283, Session Laws 1988, increased the penalty for promoting pornography to minors from a misdemeanor to a class C felony. The legislature found that it is important to keep pornography out of the hands of children, and increasing the penalty to the felony level should give pornography dealers the incentive to inquire as to the age of their customers and refuse to sell to those who are minors. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1763, House Standing Committee Report No. 1596-88.\n\nAct 21, Session Laws 2000, amended subsection (2) by narrowing the promoting pornography for minors exemption for public library staff to only acts committed by a staff member within the scope of the staff member's employment. The legislature found that there was no justification in continuing to provide a public library exemption beyond incidents where the staff member was acting within the scope of the staff member's employment. The legislature also found that this amendment struck a balance between providing minors with meaningful access to library materials and protecting them from exposure to pornographic materials while protecting responsible library staff members from threats of litigation. House Standing Committee Report Nos. 926-00 and 1304-00, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2672.\n\nAct 96, Session Laws 2018, amended the offense of promoting pornography for minors by: (1) clarifying that the exemption for guardians only applies to a legal guardian of a minor; and (2) deleting the exemption for other persons in loco parentis to a minor. The legislature found that the purpose of Act 96 was to strengthen the statutory language regarding promoting pornography for minors and to close unintended loopholes therein. The legislature also found that removing \"other persons in loco parentis\" from the exemption would further strengthen the statutory language by explicitly limiting the exemption to parents and legal guardians.

Specifically, Act 213 prohibited: (1) adults from soliciting minors to electronically transmit nude images of minors by making such conduct a misdemeanor [( §712-1215.5)]; (2) minors from electronically transmitting nude images of themselves or other minors, or soliciting other minors to do so by making such conduct a petty misdemeanor [( §712-1215.6)]; and (3) a person from possessing a nude image transmitted by a minor, but making it an affirmative defense that the recipient made reasonable efforts to destroy the transmitted nude image [( §712-1215.6)]. The legislature found that the electronic transmission of youth-produced sexual pictures and videos was a growing problem, particularly because the images can be shared with many people almost instantaneously. Once transmitted, the original transmitter had very limited ability to control or prevent further dissemination. The legislature further found that the images may be used as a commodity for exchange, and the threatened dissemination of these images may be used as leverage against the subject to force the subject to engage in behaviors that may cause embarrassment, at minimum, and possible mental or emotional harm.

The subsection addresses itself to a special prosecutorial problem. Since § §712-1214 and 1215 require knowledge on the promoter's part of the character and content of the pornography which the promoter promotes, the prosecution is required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knew of the character and content of the pornographic material or performance. However in such cases there is often little evidence of the actor's knowledge of such facts. A recent work in this area has underlined this difficulty quite well:\n\nHow does one prove (beyond a reasonable doubt) what moves in the recesses of another's mind? How does one show that a bookseller knows the items in his stock, that a theater owner is familiar with the movies he exhibits, or that a newsdealer is aware of the general character of the magazines he displays? Aside from those dubious dialogues in which a dealer says how \"hot\" is his merchandise-- conversations most unlikely to take place when the purchaser is a fifteen-year-old--scienter, realistically viewed is rarely susceptible of sure proof. But common sense may assist. No corner hardware merchant would long prosper, lacking general familiarity with the items he had for sale... similarly, honest book and magazine dealers have some general knowledge of the character of the wares they order, put on their shelves, sometimes display and ultimately hope to sell.The draft statute would transmute this common sense into law....1\n\nWith this reasoning in mind, subsection (1) allows the prosecution to get its case to the jury on the issue of the actor's knowledge of character and content of the material, film, or performance on proof of the specified conduct only.\n\nMuch the same evidentiary problem, difficulty in proving mens rea, is presented when the age of another person is made an element of the offense, as is the case in §712-1215. Section 712-1216(2) provides the same prima facie rule with respect to age that subsection (1) provides with respect to the nature of the material or performance. Again, the evidentiary rule merely permits the prosecution to get the case to the trier of fact on that issue: the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt remains on the prosecution. In such situations, the defendant would be free to introduce, but would not be obligated to do so, any evidence tending to negate the inference that the defendant knew the minor's age. In this vein, the minor's appearance, the minor's representations, and apparently official identification records (e.g., a birth certificate, driver's license, or draft card) would all be relevant factors.\n\n§712-1216 Commentary:\n\n1.

A person \"advances gambling activity\" if the person:\n\n(1) Engages in conduct that materially aids any form of gambling activity. Conduct of this nature includes but is not limited to conduct directed toward:\n\n(A) The creation or establishment of the particular game, contest, scheme, device, or activity involved;\n\n(B) The acquisition or maintenance of premises, paraphernalia, equipment, or apparatus therefor;\n\n(C) The solicitation or inducement of persons to participate therein;\n\n(D) The actual conduct of the playing phases thereof;\n\n(E) The arrangement of any of its financial or recording phases; or\n\n(F) Any other phase of its operation; or\n\n(2) Having substantial proprietary control or other authoritative control over premises being used with the person's knowledge for purposes of gambling activity, permits that activity to occur or continue or makes no effort to prevent its occurrence or continuation.\n\n\"Bookmaking\" means advancing gambling activity by accepting bets from members of the public upon the outcomes of future contingent events.\n\n\"Contest of chance\" means any contest, game, gaming scheme, or gaming device in which the outcome depends in a material degree upon an element of chance, notwithstanding that skill of the contestants may also be a factor therein.\n\n\"Gambling\". A person engages in gambling if he stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he or someone else will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome. Gambling does not include bona fide business transactions valid under the law of contracts, including but not limited to contracts for the purchase or sale at a future date of securities or commodities, and agreements to compensate for loss caused by the happening of chance, including but not limited to contracts of indemnity or guaranty and life, health, or accident insurance.\n\n\"Gambling device\" means any device, machine, paraphernalia, or equipment that is used or usable in the playing phases of any gambling activity, whether that activity consists of gambling between persons or gambling by a person involving the playing of a machine. However, lottery tickets and other items used in the playing phases of lottery schemes are not gambling devices within this definition.\n\n\"Lottery\" means a gambling scheme in which:\n\n(a) The players pay or agree to pay something of value for chances, represented and differentiated by numbers or by combinations of numbers or by some other medium, one or more of which chances are to be designated the winning ones; and\n\n(b) The winning chances are to be determined by a drawing or by some other method based on an element of chance; and\n\n(c) The holders of the winning chances are to receive something of value.\n\n\"Mutuel\" means a form of lottery in which the winning chances or plays are not determined upon the basis of a drawing or other act on the part of persons conducting or connected with the scheme, but upon the basis of the outcome or outcomes of a future contingent event or events otherwise unrelated to the particular scheme.\n\n\"Player\" means a person who engages in gambling solely as a contestant or bettor.\n\n\"Profit from gambling activity\". A person \"profits from gambling activity\" if he accepts or receives money or other property pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any person whereby he participates or is to participate in the proceeds of gambling activity.\n\n\"Social gambling\" is defined in section 712-1231.\n\n\"Something of value\" means any money or property, any token, object, or article exchangeable for money or property, or any form of credit or promise directly or indirectly contemplating transfer of money or property or of any interest therein, or involving extension of a service or entertainment. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1973, c 201, pt of §1; am L 2022, c 111, §3]\n\nRevision Note\n\nNumeric designation deleted pursuant to §23G-15.\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §712-1220\n\nThis section provides definitions of terms used repeatedly in this part of chapter 712, a discussion of the definitions is incorporated in the Commentary on the substantive sections employing the defined terms.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §712-1220\n\nAct 201, Session Laws 1973, made several changes to the definitions as previously contained in the Proposed Draft of the Code. In Item (1), the phrase \"acting other than as a player\" was deleted, so that any person, including a player, advances gambling activity if the person engages in conduct that materially aids any form of gambling activity. Also, the last sentence was added, which states: \"A person advances gambling activity if he plays or participates in any form of gambling activity.\" In Item (2) the term \"bookmaking\" previously was defined as \"advancing gambling activity by unlawfully accepting bets from members of the public as a business, rather than in a casual or personal fashion, upon the outcomes of future contingent events.\" The term \"unlawfully\" and the phrase \"as a business rather than in a casual or personal fashion\" were deleted. In Item (6), \"lottery\" was changed from \"an unlawful gambling scheme\" to \"a gambling scheme.\"\n\nIn Item (8), the Proposed Code, as well as the Code as adopted in 1972, had contained an extensive definition of the word \"player\" in an attempt to describe a player in a social gambling game. Act 201 deleted that definition and instead defined \"player\" as a person who \"engages in gambling solely as a contestant or bettor.\" In Item (9), the phrase \"other than as a player\" was deleted, so that even players may \"profit from gambling activity.\" Item (10) is a new addition stating that \"social gambling\" is defined in §712-1231. In Item (11) the phrase \"or a privilege of playing at a game or scheme without charge\" was deleted from the definition of \"something of value.\"\n\nAct 111, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to exclude simple gambling from the definition of \"advance gambling activity\" by repealing the reference to the act of playing or participating in any form of gambling activity. Conference Committee Report No. 51-22, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3847.\n\nAttorney General Opinions\n\nThe activity involved in daily fantasy sports betting is gambling under the plain meaning of Hawaii's gambling statute because: (1) the amount wagered on each daily fantasy sports contest is something of value that is being staked despite being called an \"entry fee\"; (2) daily fantasy sports contests are contests of chance and involve future contingent events not under the control of players; and (3) the major daily fantasy sports companies lay out in detail what players will receive on the basis of certain outcomes.

      "text": "§712-1223 Gambling.(1) A person commits the offense of gambling if the person knowingly participates in any gambling activity.\n\n(2) Gambling is a misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1973, c 201, pt of §1; gen ch 1993; am L 2022, c 111, §6]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §712-1221 TO 712-1223\n\nPart III of chapter 712 adopts a comprehensive pattern of gambling legislation proposed in Michigan[1] and enacted in New York.[2] These three sections of the Code initiate a comprehensive revision of Hawaii's gambling laws. For the most part the coverage of the previous law has been preserved, although the emphasis has been changed in several instances. The Code provides penalties for those who exploit gambling activity; however, at the same time, the Code introduces some limited liberalizations in the area which reflect the actual attitude of society toward gambling.\n\nPart III provides inclusive coverage for all forms of gambling exploitation. Section 712-1221 covers exploitations of gambling in the form of \"advancing\" or \"profiting\" from gambling activity.[3] It is aimed at large-scale gambling and is the most aggravated offense in this area. Under this section, a class C felony sanction is provided for a person who (a) engages in bookmaking to the extent that the person receives or accepts in any one day more than five bets totaling more than $500, (b) receives in connection with a lottery or mutuel scheme money or written records from a person other than a player whose chances or plays are represented by such money or records, or (c) receives in connection with a lottery, mutuel, or other scheme or enterprise more than $1,000 in any one day of money played in the scheme or enterprise.\n\n\"Bookmaking\" is defined in §712-1220(2) as taking bets \"upon the outcomes of future contingent events.\" The definition of \"lottery\" in §712-1220(6) is comprehensive as was that provided by the prior law,[4] without sacrificing clarity. The definition of \"mutuel\" adds a specific definition not previously contained in Hawaii legislation.[5]\n\nA class C felony is imposed for violation of §712-1221 in recognition of the large-scale exploitive nature of the offense.\n\nSection 712-1222 provides misdemeanor liability for promoting gambling in the second degree if a person knowingly profits from gambling activity. This section covers the small-time promoter who profits from gambling activity when the promoter receives money or other property as a result of participation in the proceeds of any gambling activity.\n\nAct 201, Session Laws 1973, amended §712-1222 by deleting therefrom the advancing of gambling activities and limiting it to profiting from gambling activities. This was done because advancing gambling activity is covered by the new offense of gambling. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 806 (1973).\n\nSection 712-1223 provides misdemeanor liability for gambling if a person knowingly advances or participates in any gambling activity. This is a new section which was added by Act 201, Session Laws 1973. The Legislature stated that gambling in all its aspects is to be prohibited except in the limited case of \"social gambling\" as set forth in §712-1231. Thus, in Standing Committee Report No. 806, the Senate Committee on Judiciary noted:\n\n\"While the second degree promoting offense treats the problem of 'profiting' from gambling in isolation, a new offense of 'gambling' has been created to cover all other acts related to gambling for which evidence of profit need not be available nor applicable. The point of this is to obtain a clearer statement that gambling in all its aspects is prohibited except in the limited case of 'social gambling'.\n\nUnder the existing law the broad scope of the second degree promoting offense requires that 'social gambling' be considered in a context that includes profiting from gambling. However, 'social gambling' and profiting are mutually exclusive by definition except in the case of the player's winnings. This seems to be a point of confusion. As proposed, the differential exclusion of social gambling is permitted to be considered apart from the profiting problem, and it is thought that thus, a more systematic treatment is achieved.\"\n\nThe former statutory law is all inclusive in condemning as criminal any gambling regardless of how innocuous. Under prior law it was a misdemeanor to set up or assist in any type of lottery scheme,[6] to sell or buy a ticket or chance in a lottery scheme,[7] to conduct or play any game of chance or any game where money is lost or won or to be present where such games occur,[8] to exhibit or expose to view in a barricaded place any gambling paraphernalia,[9] to be present in a barricaded place where gambling paraphernalia is exposed to view,[10] to conduct or assist in any bunco games (such as \"three card monte\" or the \"shell game\"),[11] to bet on the outcome of any sporting event,[12] and to allow another person to use any building or vessel for gambling activity.[13] The Code recognizes distinctions in gambling which were not recognized in prior law. It provides increased penalties for exploitive conduct, but exempts social gambling and the casual bet as criminal offenses. The Code's sections strengthen the law by providing a class C felony penalty for the \"professional\" promoter, instead of a misdemeanor penalty as provided under previous law. By broadly defining the terms \"advancing gambling activity\" and \"promoting gambling activity\" it makes unnecessary the explicit listing of various games of chance that was present in previous statutory law.14 Small-time gamblers are punished as misdemeanants under the Code, the same penalty available under the former law.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §712-1221 TO 712-1223\n\nAct 161, Session Laws 1983, amended §712-1221(1) so that a person may be prosecuted under this section if that person owed more than $1,000 in any one day as a result of a gambling scheme. The prior law prohibited as evidence, the receipt of wagered money, thereby requiring police to witness the actual transfer of money before making an arrest. The amendment enables police to prosecute bookmakers for gambling based on the contents of seized bookmaking records. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 721, House Standing Committee Report No. 440.\n\nAct 83, Session Laws 1987, amended §712-1221 by changing the one-day period to seven days because there were difficulties with proving promotion of gambling within a one-day period. The extension of the time period would also allow for more effective law enforcement pursuant to this section. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 545.\n\nAct 83, Session Laws 1987, amended §712-1222 by making changes to this section for the purpose of conforming with §712-1221. Conformity was desired with §712-1221 so that if there is insufficient evidence to prove the first degree offense, a person could be found guilty of the second degree offense. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 545.\n\nAct 196, Session Laws 1990, added §712-1222.5 which makes it illegal to promote gambling aboard ships. The legislature found that intrastate gambling junkets would be detrimental to the State's family oriented tourist industry. House Standing Committee Report No. 466-90.\n\nAct 57, Session Laws 1992, amended §712-1222.5 to clarify that gambling activities which are conducted during travel to and from foreign nations and Hawaii are exempt to the same extent as gambling activities which are conducted during travel to and from other states and territories of the United States and Hawaii. Act 57 further amended this section to conform subsection and paragraph designations to the style used in the Code. House Standing Committee Report No. 1198-92, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1947.\n\nAct 111, Session Laws 2022, amended §712-1221 to: (1) elevate the offense of promoting gambling in the first degree to a class B felony; and (2) change the requisite state of mind for the offense to recklessness. Act 111 also amended §712-1222 to: (1) elevate the offense of promoting gambling in the second degree to a class C felony; and (2) change the requisite state of mind for the offense to negligence. Further, Act 111 amended §712-1223 to modify the offense of gambling by repealing reference to the act of advancing any gambling activity. The legislature found that violent activity in and around illegal gambling houses had increased in recent years, with reports of armed robberies, stabbings, and shootings becoming more commonplace. The legislature further found that in addition to violent crimes, illegal gambling houses are known for being drug and sex trafficking establishments. The legislature noted that by strengthening the criminal penalties for promoting gambling in the first and second degrees, persons seeking work at illegal gambling houses would be deterred from participating in the illegal enterprise. In addition, Act 111 would guard the safety and welfare of the State's citizens, particularly in residential neighborhoods, by strengthening existing laws relating to the promotion of gambling.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1973, c 201, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §712-1224 TO 712-1226\n\nThese sections enlarge the scope of the previous law by adding inchoate gambling offenses involving the possession of gambling records or devices, thus permitting police intervention at the anticipatory stage of gambling. The sections also complement and bolster the coverage of § §712-1221, 1222, and 1223.\n\nSections 712-1224 and 1225 concern the possession of gambling records. These records may consist of any writing, paper, instrument, or article of a kind \"commonly used\" in a bookmaking, lottery, or mutuel scheme. The gradation of penalties into a class C felony and a misdemeanor is made on the same basis as the gradation of penalties for promoting gambling activities ( § §712-1221 and 1222).\n\nSection 712-1226 makes it a misdemeanor to manufacture, sell, transport, or possess a gambling device, knowing it is to be used in the advancement of gambling activity which is not social gambling. The term \"gambling device\" is defined by §712-1220(5). The definition specifically excludes from its scope lottery tickets to avoid needless overlapping of § §712-1224 and 1225 with §712-1226.\n\nThese sections are needed and justifiable for two reasons. First, because of the nature of gambling offenses, the State often cannot prove the actual promotion of gambling activity while at the same time it can easily prove the culpable possession of gambling records or devices. In view of the defense afforded by §712-1227, possession of gambling records and devices provides a legitimate basis for permitting police intervention and imposing penal liability. Secondly, by allowing the State to prosecute for possession of records or devices, society is able to restrict unlawful gambling activity while it is in its preparatory stage. Especially is this so when the definition of the possessory offense relating to gambling devices is drawn so as to cover trafficking in the devices.\n\nThe coverage of the previous statutory law is sketchy in regard to the possession of gambling records or devices. A person found in possession of a lottery ticket was guilty of a misdemeanor.[1] There was no express provision penalizing possession of bookmaking records or receipts or gambling devices. The Code fills this gap and provides a basis for earlier police intervention.\n\nThe existing case law holds that operating a pinball machine that gives free games upon the scoring of a certain amount of points is a form of gambling.[2] The Proposed Draft of the Code, as well as the Code when adopted in 1972, accepted this position. Originally, \"gambling\" turned on the possibility of receiving something of value.3 \"Something of value\" included \"a privilege of playing at a game or scheme without charge.\" Thus, possession of a pinball machine originally came within the scope of §712-1225. However, by Act 201, Session Laws 1973, the legislature amended the definition of \"something of value\" by removing the phrase \"or a privilege of playing at a game or scheme without charge.\" (See §712-1220(11), and Commentary thereon.) In commenting on the amendment, the Senate Committee on Judiciary, in Standing Committee Report No. 806 (1973) stated:\n\nThis phrase refers to such activities as pinball and other games involving the winning of a privilege of playing another game without charge. Such winnings were previously allowed under Hawaii law. Your Committee finds that there is no good reason to include 'free game' as something of value from gambling.\n\nThese three sections were originally numbered as § §712-1223, 1224 and 1225 in the Code when adopted in 1972. They were renumbered by Act 201, Session Laws 1973. Act 201 also made the following changes to these sections. In § §712-1224 and 1225, the phrase \"other than as a player\" was deleted, so that even a person who is a player may be subject to the offense of possession of gambling records. Also, in §712-1224, the clause \"and constituting, reflecting, or representing more than 500 plays or chances therein\" was inserted to describe the type of records of lottery or mutuel scheme that is necessary for the offense of possession of gambling records in the first degree.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §712-1224 TO 712-1226\n\nAct 174, Session Laws 1980, amended §712-1224 by expanding the offense to include persons who produce or distribute gambling records and by clarifying the definition and monetary amounts of such records. The purpose was to provide for more effective enforcement and to curb the number of pool tickets for extremely high amounts.

The procedure provides, as did the previous law,[2] for the protection of innocent owners of property which is involved in the commission of an offense. Intentionally omitted are prior provisions permitting a person who loses funds gambling to sue for recovery,[3] permitting a police officer, officer, or other person to sue to recover treble damages based on the amount lost (in which case one-half went to the person so prosecuting and one-half to the state for use for public schools),[4] and voiding instruments of indebtedness used in gambling.5 These provisions are unrealistic, seldom, if ever, invoked, and unnecessary in view of the general forfeiture provision. This section was renumbered from §712-1229 to §712-1230, by Act 201, Session Laws 1973.\n\nIn State v. Nobuhara, 52 Haw. 319, 474 P.2d 707 (1970), the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that certain moneys seized under a violation of former HRS §746-8, which proscribed betting on an athletic contest, could not be forfeited. The Court declared that there was no evidence to tie in the moneys with the betting activities and thus could not be forfeited under HRS §746-12.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §712-1230\n\nAct 83, Session Laws 1979, amended this section to better define the properties which may be forfeited when used in illegal gambling. Within this context, the legislature specifically intended that \"only paraphernalia used in fighting animals and birds be susceptible to ... forfeiture ... as distinguished from the animals or birds themselves.\" Conference Committee Report No. 60. The Act also established a preponderance of evidence standard for courts to use in determining whether forfeiture should be ordered.\n\nAct 57, Session Laws 1992, amended this section to clarify that forfeitures of property used in illegal gambling are subject to the requirements of chapter 712A.

[L 1973, c 201, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §712-1231\n\nSection 712-1231 is a completely new and rewritten section set forth by Act 201, Session Laws 1973. This section defines \"social gambling\" as gambling activity that meets all the prescribed conditions. These conditions are: (1) that all players engage as contestants on \"equal terms\"; (2) that no profiting be involved--other than the player's winnings; (3) that it should not be conducted at certain enumerated places, such as hotels, school grounds, public parks, any business establishment, etc.; (4) that no minor be involved in the game; and (5) that the gambling activity is not bookmaking. (Senate Standing Committee Report No. 806 (1973).)\n\nWith respect to the concept of prohibiting gambling in enumerated places, the Standing Committee Report states:\n\nYour Committee notes the addition of the concept that gambling in certain enumerated places such as hotels, public parks, etc.-- is prohibited and that gambling conducted in such places is not to come within the protected confines of 'social gambling.' It is felt that this addition to the law clarifies the legislature's intent to prevent the intrusion of hotel and casino type operations into this State, as well as prevent exposure of gambling to children in public parks, school grounds, etc.\n\nIn this connection, casual gambling activities in a social context, involving contests of skill, and conducted in places other than those enumerated in the law, such as casual bets between golfers or bowlers would be \"social gambling\".\n\nSection 712-1231 provides that in any prosecution for an offense described in §712-1223, 1224, 1225, or 1226, the defendant may assert the affirmative defense that the gambling activity was a social gambling game as defined in this section. In respect thereto, the Standing Committee Report No. 806 (1973), Senate Judiciary Committee, states:\n\nThere has been considerable concern whether the affirmative defense provisions of the Hawaii Penal Code are constitutional. In that regard, your Committee understands that statutorily prescribed affirmative defenses have been held constitutional. See Territory of Hawaii v. Shizuichi Yamamoto, et. al., 39 Haw. 556 (1952); McKelvey v. United States, 260 U.S. 353 (1922); United States v. Sidney B. Rowlette, et. al., 297 F.2d 475 (1968); and U.S. v. Carl Oslin Rumzy, Jr. 446 F.2d 1184 (1971).\n\nA major change affected is the erasure of any mandatory requirement that the defendant utilize this affirmative defense. We note that this is an area of great concern. That is, whether the affirmative defense in the existing law forces the defendant, as a legal requirement, to testify in potential self-incrimination.\n\nWithout addressing ourselves to any other application of the affirmative defense in the Hawaii Penal Code, your Committee notes the existing law was to provide in §712-1231(b) that a defendant's resort to the affirmative defense is discretionary. See People v. Felder, 334 N.Y.S. 2d 992 (1972).\n\nThere appears to be some confusion as to the prosecutor's burden of proof in relation to the defense of social gambling. It is intended that the prosecution should not have the burden of proving as part of its prima facie case, that the gambling activity in question was other than a social gambling game. Accordingly, an explicit statement to that effect was included in §712-1231(c).\n\nIn contrast, it is the intent that the defendant shall be entitled to acquittal on the basis of the affirmative defense only if the trier of the facts finds by a preponderance of the evidence the facts constituting the affirmative defense. In other words, the defendant has both the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of evidence with respect to the affirmative defense of social gambling.\n\nDefendants did not prove that no person other than players received or became entitled to receive anything of value. 2 H. App. 606, 638 P.2d 338 (1981).\n\nAlthough it may have been error admitting into evidence, as expert opinion under HRE rule 702, officer's testimony concerning subsection (b), the social gambling defense, where defendant was not entitled to this defense in a prosecution for promoting gambling in the first degree under §712-1221(1)(c), error was harmless. 92 H. 98 (App.), 987 P.2d 996 (1999).",

The definitions are discussed, when an explanation is needed, in the commentary on the following sections.\n\nThe Code made several changes to the recommendations of the proposed draft for this section. It redefined \"dangerous drug\", and added definitions of such new terms as \"harmful drug\", \"detrimental drug\", \"immediate precursor\", \"intoxicating compounds\", \"practitioner\", and \"to distribute\". Concurrently, the Code eliminated the proposed draft's definitions of the terms \"narcotic drug\" and \"to dispense\". The Code also changed the draft's definition of the word \"unlawfully\". Instead of \"narcotic drug and dangerous drug\", the term concerned is \"a Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V substance\", as well as marijuana, marijuana concentrates, and intoxicating compounds.\n\nAct 163, Session Laws 1975, amended this section in two respects. The word \"unlawfully\" was deleted from the list of definitions and from every other section in this part where it was made an element of an offense. The legislature found that the inclusion of this element required the prosecution to prove a negative without being able to compel the accused to testify. It was found that this was a practical impossibility and accordingly it has been eliminated as an element of every offense in this part. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 590.\n\nThe legislature also amended the definition of marijuana so as to indicate that the entire genus cannabis was to be included in the term and not merely cannabis sativa.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §712-1240\n\nAct 112, Session Laws 1979, amended this section by adding the broadly defined term \"dosage unit.\" The legislature found that drugs, while commonly sold in tablets, capsules, or other forms covered by existing drugs laws, are also distributed and sold in forms which are not covered. The legislature believed that these amendments would lessen the promotion of dangerous drugs within the State. Conference Committee Report No. 41.\n\nAct 122, Session Laws 1984, added the definition of intoxicating liquor because of the inclusion of a new section prohibiting adults from promoting intoxicating liquor to a minor.\n\nAct 356, Session Laws 1987, added \"and section 712-1242\" to the definition of \"dosage unit,\" for the purpose of conformity between sections 712-1241 and 712-1242. House Standing Committee Report No. 480.\n\nAct 319, Session Laws 1997, amended this section by defining \"manufacture.\" The legislature found that the growing problem of manufacturing dangerous drugs in Hawaii posed a significant problem to law enforcement officials given the lack of powerful sanctions under current law. The legislature believed it was imperative to establish an aggressive policy for penalizing the manufacture, sale, and distribution of dangerous drugs. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 770, House Standing Committee Report No. 1651.\n\nAct 193, Session Laws 2004, made medical gamma hydroxybutyric acid a schedule III depressant and made conforming amendments to the definitions of \"dangerous drugs\" and \"harmful drug\" in this section to make the nonmedical use of gamma hydroxybutyric acid an appropriately severe crime. House Standing Committee Report No. 701-04.\n\nAct 34, Session Laws 2012, amended the definitions of \"dangerous drugs\" and \"harmful drug\" by changing the reference to \"section 329-18(c)(13)\" to \"section 329-18(c)(14)\" to correctly reference gamma hydroxybutyric acid.\n\nAct 14, Session Laws 2020, amended this section by adding a definition for \"hemp\" and amending the definitions of \"marijuana\" and \"marijuana concentrate\" to conform with the provisions of Act 14 that excluded hemp from the State's prohibitions against marijuana. The legislature found that hemp was no longer classified as an illegal drug under federal law due to the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, informally known as the \"Farm Bill.\" The Farm Bill authorized the department of agriculture of each state wishing to have primary regulatory authority over hemp production in that state to submit to the federal Secretary of Agriculture a proposed plan for the state's department of agriculture to monitor and regulate hemp production within the state, including a procedure for conducting annual inspections of a random sample of hemp producers. The legislature further found that research on hemp showed significant potential for a successful hemp agricultural industry in Hawaii. Hemp grows quickly, has the beneficial effects of removing toxins from the soil and acting as a superior phytoremediation crop, is environmentally friendly, and serves as an efficient feedstock and source for biofuel. Also, hemp can be made into clothing and used in other products to promote the growth of small businesses. Act 14 facilitated the regulation and production of industrial hemp in the State. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3776.\n\nAct 137, Session Laws 2022, extended to July 1, 2025, the sunset date of Act 14, Session Laws 2020, which established the state hemp processors and commercial hemp production laws. Act 14 amended §712-1240 by adding the definition of \"hemp\" and amending the definitions of \"marijuana\" and \"marijuana concentrate\". The legislature found that Act 14 established a regulatory framework for the department of agriculture to monitor and regulate the cultivation and processing of hemp. However, in 2022, the hemp industry in the State remained in a nascent stage largely due to overly burdensome regulations established under Act 14. The legislature noted that with Act 14 originally scheduled to sunset on June 30, 2022, there remained considerable disagreement on the required reforms for the hemp industry. Accordingly, the legislature found it necessary to extend the sunset date of Act 14 to July 1, 2025. Conference Committee Report No. 61-22, House Standing Committee Report No. 1905-22.\n\nAct 263, Session Laws 2023, extended to July 1, 2027, the sunset date of Act 14, Session Laws 2020, which established the hemp processors and commercial hemp production laws. Act 14 amended this section by adding the definition of \"hemp\" and amending the definitions of \"marijuana\" and \"marijuana concentrate.\" The legislature found that Act 14 authorized the cultivation of hemp and the production and sale of hemp products in the State. However, hemp cultivation and production in the State faced significant barriers in regulation that stifled industry growth. The legislature additionally found that reducing this regulatory burden would allow the industry to thrive and lead to increased production of hemp for fuel, food, clothing and building material, natural plastic alternatives, and numerous other products. Act 263 balanced the interests of industry growth and protection of human health by reducing redundant regulatory barriers while ensuring appropriate protections are in place. House Standing Committee Report No. 749, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1884.\n\nOne who acts as buyer's agent to purchase drug with buyer's funds does not commit offense of \"selling\" the drug. 60 H. 8, 586 P.2d 1022 (1978).\n\n\"To distribute\" does not include \"to buy\" or \"to offer to buy\". 78 H. 317, 893 P.2d 168 (1995).\n\nAlthough there was substantial evidence to conclude that defendant was a drug distributor in violation of §712-1242, defendant was entitled to a procuring agent defense instruction as (1) a jury instruction must be given on every defense if there is any support in the evidence \"no matter how weak, inconclusive or unsatisfactory the evidence may be\", (2) defendant's participation in drug transaction negotiation or touching the drugs or money involved did not foreclose a procuring agent defense, (3) determining whether defendant was an agent of buyer was for the fact finder, and (4) there was support in evidence for a procuring agent defense. 113 H. 385, 153 P.3d 456 (2007).\n\nCharge of possession of \"marijuana concentrate hashish\" established by presence of THC and absence of marijuana plant; fact that commonly accepted connotation of \"concentrate\" is that of more powerful substance is irrelevant for purposes of section; section not unconstitutionally vague. 4 H. App. 79, 661 P.2d 1206 (1983).",

The offenses are: 1) promoting a dangerous drug; 2) promoting a harmful drug; 3) promoting a detrimental drug; and 4) promoting intoxicating compounds. All of the drug offenses are divided into three degrees. The intoxicating compound offense is in one degree, a misdemeanor.\n\nDangerous Drugs.These drugs are defined in §712-1240 as any substance or immediate precursor defined as a Schedule I or II substance by chapter 329, Hawaii Revised Statutes, except marijuana or marijuana concentrate. Chapter 329 is the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, which was enacted by the 1972 legislature. Schedule I substances have the \"highest degree of danger or probable danger\"[1] and includes such drugs as morphine[2] and heroin,[3] among others. Schedule II substances have a \"high degree of danger or probable danger\",[4] and includes, among others, such drugs as opium[5] and cocaine.[6]\n\nThese drugs are the most fearsome in their potential for destruction of physical and mental well being. The drugs of this category are characterized by a high tolerance level which requires the user to use greater and greater amounts each time to achieve the same \"high\".[7] More importantly, all the drugs, with the exception of cocaine to some extent, are highly addictive;[8] that is, if use of the drug is discontinued, severe withdrawal symptoms occur which can be relieved only by more of the drug.[9] The combination of a high tolerance level and addictive liability creates a physical dependence in the user which may lead, and in many cases has led, the user to commit crimes to obtain money needed to buy more narcotics.\n\nUnder §712-1243, a person commits the offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree if the person \"knowingly\" possesses any dangerous drug in any amount. The offense is a class C felony.\n\nThe offense is in the second degree, a class B felony, if the defendant possesses a specified quantity of a dangerous drug. Thus, it would be a second degree offense if the defendant possesses 1/8 ounce of heroin, morphine, or cocaine, or 50 or more capsules, tablets, ampules, syrettes containing one or more dangerous drugs or 1/2 ounce of any other dangerous drug. It would also be promoting a dangerous drug in the second degree if the defendant \"distributes\" any dangerous drug in any amount. The word \"distribute\", as defined in §712-1240, means to \"sell, transfer, give, or deliver to another or to leave, barter, exchange with another, or to offer or agree to do the same\".\n\nSection 712-1241 deals with promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree, which is a class A felony. A person commits this offense if the person \"knowingly\" possesses one ounce or more of morphine, heroin, or cocaine, or two ounces or more of any other dangerous drug. It would also cover a person who \"knowingly\" distributes 50 capsules, etc., of a dangerous drug, or 1/8 ounce of heroin, morphine, or cocaine, or 1/2 ounce of any other dangerous drug. Finally, the offense is committed if any dangerous drug is distributed to any minor who is at least three years younger than the distributor.\n\nHarmful Drugs.These drugs, according to §712-1240, mean any substance or immediate precursor listed as a Schedule III or IV substance by chapter 329, and include marijuana concentrates, but not marijuana. Schedule III substances, which have a degree of danger or probable danger less than substances in Schedules I and II, include drugs which have a stimulant or depressant effect on the central nervous system.[10] Schedule IV substances generally have a depressant effect on the central nervous system.[11]\n\n\"Marijuana concentrates\" are defined to include hashish and tetrahydrocannabinol. Formerly, hashish was defined under \"narcotics\",[12] which it is not. Tetrahydrocannabinol is the recently synthesized active principal of marijuana. It is believed that hashish and tetrahydrocannabinol, and its alkaloids, salts, derivatives, preparations, compounds, and mixtures, will be subject to more abuse in the future due to the rise in popularity of marijuana,[13] of which hashish is a concentrated resin extract. It is vital that persons tempted to deal in or use these substances be warned that their effects are more dangerous than those of marijuana,[14] and that thus its possession and distribution are subject to severer sanctions.\n\nUnder §712-1246, a person commits the offense of promoting a \"harmful\" drug in the third degree if the person knowingly possesses any harmful drug in any amount. The offense is a misdemeanor. However, if the person distributes a harmful drug or marijuana concentrate, then under §712-1245, it is an offense in the second degree, which is a class B felony. It is also in the second degree if the person possesses 50 or more capsules, etc., of a harmful drug or marijuana concentrate, or 1/8 ounce of a harmful drug or marijuana concentrate.\n\nSection 712-1244 makes the offense in the first degree, a class A felony, if the possession totalled 400 or more capsules or tablets of harmful drugs or marijuana concentrates, or one ounce of such harmful drug or marijuana concentrate. It is also in the first degree if the defendant distributes 50 or more capsules or tablets of the same, or 1/8 ounce or more of the same. Finally, it is promoting harmful drug in the first degree if defendant knowingly distributes a harmful drug or marijuana concentrate to a minor who is three years the defendant's junior.\n\nDetrimental Drugs.These drugs are defined in §712-1240 as marijuana or any Schedule V substance listed in chapter 329. Schedule V substances, which are less dangerous than Schedule IV substances, include limited quantities of certain types of narcotic drugs combined with nonnarcotic ingredients.\n\nIt should be noted again that marijuana concentrates are not included under the term \"marijuana\". It now appears that marijuana is not addictive; that is, there are no withdrawal symptoms at the discontinuance of the use of the substance so the user is not forced to continue taking it because of physical need;[15] the substance has no tolerance level so there is no necessity to take more each time to achieve the same \"high\";[16] and finally, hallucinations and other elements of model psychosis are rare and appear to occur only under very large doses.[17] Such large doses are usually risked only by the users of hashish.[18]\n\nUnder §712-1249, a person commits the offense of promoting a detrimental drug in the third degree, which is a petty misdemeanor, if the person knowingly possesses marijuana or any Schedule V substance in any amount. The offense is in the second degree if the possession is of 50 or more capsules or tablets of a Schedule V substance, or 1/8 ounce or more of such substance, or one ounce or more of marijuana. Also, it is a second degree offense if the defendant \"sells\" marijuana or distributes a Schedule V substance in any amount. Under §712-1248, the second degree offense is classified as a misdemeanor.\n\nUnder §712-1247, promoting a detrimental drug in the first degree is a class C felony. Here again, the offense is concerned with the knowing possession or distribution of specified amount of Schedule V substances or marijuana. The offense is also committed if there is distribution to a minor who is three years younger than the defendant.\n\nIllegal traffic in dangerous drugs, harmful drugs, and detrimental drugs.It is the purpose of the Code to hit hardest at the illegal trafficker in dangerous drugs, harmful drugs, and detrimental drugs. The scheme devised for so doing is to arrange the sanctions relating to each substance, either for possession or distributing, on the basis of the amounts involved. Such amounts are meant to reflect, i.e., provide an indicia of the position of the defendant in the illegal drug traffic. Large amounts indicate the defendant is a main source of supply, sometimes called an \"importer\", \"dealer\", or \"wholesaler\". Middle amounts indicate that the defendant is an intermediary between the main source and the consumer; sometimes the intermediary is called a \"pusher\", \"carrier\", or \"retailer\". Finally, the smallest amounts indicate the defendant's main involvement in the traffic is that of a user or consumer of drugs or substances. In keeping with the purpose of the Code, the greater the amounts involved the more severe the sanctions. Also, it will be noted that the offenses of distributing a given substance are classed or graded one degree above the possession of the same amount. Thus, for example, in § §712-1241 and 1242, the possession of \"wholesale\" amounts of a dangerous drug is a class A felony; however, the defendant who distributes \"retail\" amounts of a dangerous drug will receive the same sanction, whereas possession of that amount is a class B felony. In equating, for purposes of classification and sanction, possession of a given amount of a substance with distributing a somewhat smaller amount, the Code attempts to provide the same sanction for persons at the same level of involvement in the trafficking of a particular substance. For example, a \"pusher\" is likely to possess a larger supply of one or more of the specified substances which the pusher would distribute on a given occasion; the pusher will break down the pusher's supply into smaller, marketable amounts before distributing.\n\nDistributing to Minors.The Code attaches severe penalties to distributing to the young. This position reflects society's special interest in protecting the young from those who encourage or induce young people to experiment in any drug, or pander to their wishes to do so. In each category of substances, the offense of distributing to a minor receives the most serious sanction involving the individual substance.\n\nIt should be noted that the Code severely punishes the distribution of any drug to a minor who is at least three years younger than the defendant. Thus if a dangerous drug is involved, §712-1241(1)(c) makes it a first degree offense. Similarly, §712-1244(1)(e) makes it promoting a harmful drug in the first degree if there is distribution of a harmful drug or marijuana concentrate to a minor who is three years younger than the defendant. Under §712-1247(1)(g) the same type of treatment is made when a detrimental drug is involved.\n\nIntoxicating Compounds.The Code, under §712-1250, makes it a misdemeanor for a person to knowingly \"breathe, inhale, or drink\" certain intoxicating compounds, and prohibits the sale or offer for sale of such compounds to persons under 18 years of age.\n\nThe Code differs from the proposed draft in several respects. Basically, it changes the draft by incorporating the schedules set forth in the companion statute, Uniform Controlled Substances Act, which was enacted by the 1972 legislature. This is based on the \"Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970\" (Public Law 91-513). Thus the Hawaii law generally is in accord with the federal law relating to the drug abuse problem.\n\nIn another revision, the Code has included the offense of promoting intoxicating compounds, which are found in chapter 328 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. Another change is that the Code handles the problem of avoiding severe sanctions on youthful offenders by requiring a three-year difference in age between the offender and the minor involved.\n\nPrior Law.The Code differs basically in spirit from previous Hawaii law on drugs, and intoxicants. First and foremost, under prior law, all prohibited drugs were treated the same, with marijuana considered a narcotic along with heroin, morphine, and cocaine.[19] Thus the sale of a narcotic or a dangerous drug or marijuana carried a possible penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1,000 fine for a first conviction.[20] Also, prior law provided no distinction between possessing and transferring a dangerous drug; the same penalty stated for selling existed for possession of any such drug.[21] However, a distinction was made under the previous law, in the case of narcotics, between selling or possessing with intent to sell, on the one hand, and simple possession on the other. The former case was a 10-year felony upon first conviction, and the latter case was a 5-year felony upon first conviction.[22] Possession of marijuana could be treated either as a felony or misdemeanor upon first conviction.[23] Because of difficulties of proof, the offense based on intent to sell was rarely invoked. There were no differentiations based on the amounts involved except as related to a presumption of intent to sell.[24] The Code's approach, which attempts to provide some indicia of the defendant's role in the drug, marijuana concentrate, or marijuana traffic, and the dangerousness of the substance involved, rationalizes previous law. The Code is essentially in agreement with the policy of special sanctions, in previous Hawaii law,[25] for those who unlawfully dispense or sell narcotics, dangerous drugs, or marijuana to minors. Although the differentiation based on amounts must be considered, the Code (1) generally increases the available penalties for dangerous drug offenses, (2) is in accord with previous penalties relating to harmful drug offenses, and (3) provides a slight reduction relating to detrimental drug offenses.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §712-1241 TO 712-1250\n\nAct 119, Session Laws 1975, amended § §712-1244 and 712-1245 by increasing the penalty one step to create a greater deterrent to persons considering engaging in the proscribed activities. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 775, House Standing Committee Report No. 480.\n\nAct 163, Session Laws 1975, deleted the term \"unlawfully\" from the description of any offense set forth in this part for the reasons stated in the Commentary on §712-1240.\n\nAct 112, Session Laws 1979, amended §712-1241 by adding the broadly defined term \"dosage unit.\" The legislature found that drugs, while commonly sold in tablets, capsules, or other forms covered by existing drug laws, are also distributed and sold in forms which are not covered. The legislature believed that these amendments would lessen the promotion of dangerous drugs within the State. Conference Committee Report No. 41.\n\nAct 31, Session Laws 1981, deleted \"who is at least three years his junior\" after \"minor\" in § §712-1241, 712-1244, and 712-1247 to remove an incentive to recruit young persons as \"pushers.\" Senate Standing Committee Report No. 403, House Standing Committee Report No. 944.\n\nAct 123, Session Laws 1981, amended §712-1247 by adding subsection (3) to deal with the storage and transportation problem, which was increasing with the rise in marijuana cases. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 13, House Conference Committee Report No. 14.\n\nAct 9, Session Laws 1982, amended § §712-1241 and 712-1242 by deleting the references to alkaloids of heroin, morphine, and cocaine, there being no such alkaloids.\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, added §712-1249.5 to make commercial growing of marijuana a crime and a class B felony. House Standing Committee Report No. 487.\n\nAct 356, Session Laws 1987, added the term \"dosage units\" to §712-1242 for the purpose of conforming this section with §712-1241. House Standing Committee Report No. 480.\n\nAct 146, Session Laws 1988, added methamphetamine to the list of drugs under §712-1241. The changes to this section are intended to control the sale, use or possession of the street drug, known by various names such as: \"crystal,\" \"crystal meth,\" \"crack\" and \"ice.\" It is intended that the illegal distribution of prescription methamphetamine in its capsule or tablet form remains within the scope of subsection (1)(b)(i). House Standing Committee Report No. 1093-88, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 271.\n\nAct 284, Session Laws 1988, added §712-1249.6 which makes the promotion of a controlled substance in or around a school a class C felony. This section will give law enforcement officials the power to conduct investigations of drug dealers who operate in the vicinity of the schools. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 268, House Conference Committee Report No. 118-88.\n\nAct 291, Session Laws 1988, added methamphetamine to the list of drugs covered by §712-1242. The changes are intended to control the sale, use or possession of the street drug, known by various names such as: \"crystal,\" \"crystal meth,\" \"crack\" and \"ice.\" It is intended that the illegal distribution of prescription methamphetamine in its capsule or tablet form will remain within the scope of subsection (1)(a). House Standing Committee Report No. 1085-88, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 277.\n\nAct 163, Session Laws 1989, added §712-1246.5 and amended various sections in this part to reduce the quantity of dangerous and harmful drugs required for conviction of the crime of promoting such drugs to provide law enforcement officers a much needed tool in the war on drugs. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 168, House Conference Committee Report No. 163.\n\nAct 384, Session Laws 1989, added §712-1249.4 and amended various sections in this part to provide stiffer penalties for the promotion of marijuana and similar substances in furtherance of the war against drugs. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 164, House Conference Committee Report No. 146.\n\nAct 11, Session Laws 1991, amended §712-1249.6 by prohibiting distribution or possession of drugs on or near school vehicles. The legislature felt this measure would ensure that the drug free school zone law would not be easily circumvented and drug dealing on buses or at bus stops would be discouraged. House Standing Committee Report No. 545.\n\nAct 308, Session Laws 1996, amended § §712-1241, 712-1242, and 712-1243 by providing for mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for offenses involving methamphetamines. The stiffer penalties were intended to counter increased property and violent crimes associated with the use of methamphetamines. Conference Committee Report No. 29, House Standing Committee Report No. 734-96.\n\nAct 319, Session Laws 1997, amended §712-1241 by including the manufacture of dangerous drugs in any amount in the offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree, and by providing a ten-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment applicable to the offense of manufacturing methamphetamine. The legislature found that the growing problem of manufacturing dangerous drugs in Hawaii posed a significant problem to law enforcement officials given the lack of powerful sanctions under current law. Further, the illegal manufacture and abuse of \"ice,\" a form of methamphetamine, presented an imminent public health threat as a highly addictive drug linked to violent behavior. The legislature believed it was imperative to establish an aggressive policy for penalizing the manufacture, sale, and distribution of dangerous drugs. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 770, House Standing Committee Report No. 1651.\n\nAct 161, Session Laws 2002, amended § §712-1241, 712-1242, and 712-1243 to require that first-time nonviolent drug offenders be sentenced to undergo and complete drug treatment instead of incarceration. The legislature found that the link between substance abuse and crime is well-established. The legislature did not wish to diminish the seriousness of crime, but looked to approaching crime as being the result of addiction that is treatable. The treatment route was expected to produce a reduction in crime and recidivism. The legislature intended to promote treatment of nonviolent substance abuse offenders, rather than incarceration, as being in the best interests of the individual and the community at large. Conference Committee Report No. 96-02.\n\nAct 70, Session Laws 2003, amended §712-1249.6 to extend the offense of promoting a controlled substance near schools or school vehicles to include public parks. The legislature found that public parks serve functions similar to those served by school playgrounds where people congregate for recreation and student activities. These areas should be free from the bad influence that drug activity can inflict upon Hawaii's youth. House Standing Committee Report No. 311, Conference Committee Report No. 8.\n\nAct 44, Session Laws 2004, amended § §712-1241, 712-1242, and 712-1243, by eliminating the manufacturing and distribution of methamphetamine elements which are incorporated in a new offense of methamphetamine trafficking [ §712-1259]. The mandatory minimum sentences for methamphetamine were deleted because of the creation of the new offense. House Standing Committee Report No. 495-04.\n\nAct 44, Session Laws 2004, amended §712-1249.6 to make the manufacture of methamphetamine within seven hundred fifty feet of a school or public park a class A felony and expanded the definition of schools to include preschools, kindergarten, and middle schools. House Standing Committee Report No. 495-04.\n\nAct 44, Session Laws 2004, added §712-1249.7, creating a new offense of promoting a controlled substance through the use of a minor, as part of the Act's comprehensive legislation to address the devastating effects of crystal methamphetamine (commonly known as \"ice\") abuse in Hawaii. House Standing Committee Report No. 495-04.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §712-1241(1) by, among other things, deleting references to §712-1240.6, which was repealed by the Act.\n\nAct 27, Session Laws 2007, amended §712-1242(1) by deleting an obsolete reference [to §712-1240.6]. The legislature repealed §712-1240.6 with Act 230, Session Laws 2006. However, the reference to that section was not deleted from §712-1242. Act 27 rectified the oversight. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1368.\n\nAct 23, Session Laws 2012, amended §712-1249.6 to extend the offense of promoting a controlled substance in, on, or near schools, school vehicles, or public parks to include public housing projects and complexes. The legislature found that there was a cycle of substance abuse and drug trafficking common in public housing projects or complexes. Act 23 established the crime of promoting a controlled substance in, on, or near a public housing project or complex as a class C felony, or, in the case of manufacturing methamphetamine within a certain distance from a public housing project or complex, as a class A felony. These deterrents should significantly improve the ability of the Hawaii housing public authority to ensure a secure, livable community for public housing residents. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2225, House Standing Committee Report No. 1292-12.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended § §712-1241(1) and 712-1242(1) by placing possession and distribution of methamphetamine in the sections, giving the court the discretion to impose probation and drug treatment when appropriate. Act 231 removed possession and distribution of methamphetamine from the methamphetamine trafficking statutes [by amending § §712-1240.7 and 712-1240.9 and repealing §712-1240.8]. The amendments implemented recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015). The Penal Code Review Committee commented, on page 59 of its report, that \"while the Committee recognizes these dangers and challenges, it is of the opinion that the current Methamphetamine Trafficking statutes are not properly addressing those challenges and should be changed based on the experience of the Committee regarding the application of these provisions in the criminal justice system in Hawaii.\" House Standing Committee Report No. 660-16.\n\nAct 273, Session Laws 2019, amended §712-1249 to decriminalize the possession of three grams or less of marijuana and establish that the possession is a violation punishable by a monetary fine of $130. The legislature found that ten states and the District of Columbia had legalized the recreational use of marijuana by adults, and that others were in the process of considering legalization. The legislature further found that legalization in these states had avoided the criminalization of thousands of people, reduced opioid overdose deaths and untreated opioid use disorders, and lowered the number of arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs. In addition, recent polling indicated broad public support in Hawaii for the legalization of marijuana. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1429.\n\n§ §712-1241 To 712-1250 Commentary:\n\n1.

Senate Conference Report No. 40.\n\nAct 207, Session Laws 1992, removed the repeal date of Act 342, Session Laws of Hawaii 1986, to permanently raise the minimum drinking age to twenty-one.

The legislature believed that this Act would help increase compliance with the law by necessitating identification checks, at minimum, for those that hold liquor licenses, as well as hold accountable those persons who allow or influence the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol to a person under the age of twenty-one.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nRevision Note\n\nIn subsection (2)(a), \"or\" deleted pursuant to §23G-15.\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §712-1251\n\nSubsection (1) of this section establishes a rule of prima facie evidence regarding the possession of a dangerous drug, harmful drug, or detrimental drug when it is found in a motor vehicle. Section 701-117 sets forth the definition of \"prima facie evidence\". Subsection (2) provides that the evidentiary rule does not apply to various occupants of a vehicle under certain circumstances. If the substance is found upon the person of one of the occupants, then the evidentiary rule does not apply to other occupants of the vehicle. If it is found in some area of the vehicle normally accessible only to the driver, the rule applies only to the driver. If a drug is found in the part of a hired or chauffeured vehicle used or occupied by passengers, the evidentiary rule does not apply to the driver but does apply to the passenger or passengers.\n\nWhen any of the specified substances is found in a vehicle, but not upon the person of one of the occupants, it is almost impossible for the prosecutor to prove actual possession by direct evidence. However, the inference, in the absence of contrary evidence which raises a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact, is overwhelming that if, for example, the substance is in that portion of the vehicle to which only the driver and owner have access, that the substance is in fact in the possession and under the control of the owner-occupant or driver-occupant. The same holds true for the other provisions of subsections (1) and (2). Therefore, subsections (1) and (2) are designed and provided to let the prosecutor get the case to the jury in situations where direct evidence is difficult to obtain and the weight of a logical inference is sufficient to warrant a special evidentiary rule.\n\nSection permits but does not require the inference of guilt, and is constitutional as applied to dealership quantities of drugs. 61 H. 99, 595 P.2d 1072 (1979).",

If a first offender is guilty of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, or promoting a harmful drug in the second or third degrees, or promoting a detrimental drug in the second or third degrees, or promoting intoxicating compounds, the first offender qualifies for a conditional discharge.\n\nIf the defendant is under 20 years old, §712-1256 provides that the court records may be expunged upon application. The Code recognizes that many offenders may be young persons who are otherwise without criminal records. The Code attempts to assure proper sanctions, while at the same time allowing for moderation of punishment and sentencing of first offenders.",

The failure of a seller to request and examine photographic identification from a person under twenty-one years of age prior to the sale of a tobacco product or an electronic smoking device to the person shall be construed against the seller and form a conclusive basis for the seller's violation of this section.\n\n(4) Signs using the statement, \"The sale of tobacco products or electronic smoking devices to persons under twenty-one is prohibited\", shall be posted on or near any vending machine in letters at least one-half inch high and at or near the point of sale of any other location where tobacco products or electronic smoking devices are sold in letters at least one-half inch high.\n\n(5) It shall be unlawful for a person under twenty-one years of age to purchase or possess any tobacco product or electronic smoking device, as those terms are defined in subsection (7). This provision does not apply if a person under the age of twenty-one, with parental authorization, is participating in a controlled purchase as part of a law enforcement activity or a study authorized by the department of health under the supervision of law enforcement to determine the level of incidence of tobacco or electronic smoking devices sales to persons under twenty-one years of age.\n\n(6) Any person who violates subsection (1) or (4), or both, shall be fined $500 for the first offense. Any subsequent offenses shall subject the person to a fine not less than $500 nor more than $2,000. Any person under twenty-one years of age who violates subsection (5) shall be fined $10 for the first offense. Any subsequent offense shall subject the violator to a fine of $50, no part of which shall be suspended, or the person shall be required to perform not less than forty-eight hours nor more than seventy-two hours of community service during hours when the person is not employed and is not attending school. Any tobacco product or electronic smoking device, as those terms are defined in subsection (7), in the person's possession at the time of violation of subsection (5) shall be seized, summarily forfeited to the State, and destroyed by law enforcement following the conclusion of an administrative or judicial proceeding finding that a violation of subsection (5) has been committed. The procedures set forth in chapter 712A shall not apply to this subsection.\n\n(7) For the purposes of this section:\n\n\"Electronic smoking device\" means any electronic product that can be used to aerosolize and deliver nicotine or other substances to the person inhaling from the device, including but not limited to an electronic cigarette, electronic cigar, electronic cigarillo, or electronic pipe, and any cartridge or other component of the device or related product.\n\n\"Tobacco product\" means any product made or derived from tobacco that contains nicotine or other substances and is intended for human consumption or is likely to be consumed, whether smoked, heated, chewed, absorbed, dissolved, inhaled, or ingested by other means. \"Tobacco product\" includes but is not limited to a cigarette, cigar, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, snus, or an electronic smoking device. \"Tobacco product\" does not include drugs, devices, or combination products approved for sale by the United States Food and Drug Administration, as those terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

The legislature found that the use of electronic smoking devices, also known as e-cigarettes, is proliferating and that the electronic smoking device industry is rapidly expanding. According to a 2016 report by the United States Surgeon General, e-cigarette use among the nation's youth and young adults has become a major public health concern. For these reasons, the legislature found it necessary, as a matter of statewide concern, to regulate the sale of cigarettes, tobacco products, and electronic smoking devices in a uniform and exclusive manner.

[L 2010, c 136, §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §712-1270 TO 712-1281\n\nAct 181, Session Laws 1979, established this part to provide a remedy to abate as nuisances, offenses against public health and morals in the nature of offenses defined as prostitution, the display of indecent matter, and the like. It is based largely on sections 11225 to 11235 of the California Penal Code.\n\nIn enacting §712-1279, the legislature thought it desirable to place the burden upon the property owner to take appropriate action against the lessee to abate the nuisance, but felt that a categorical mandate requiring notice of revocation might raise collateral problems, particularly where chains of subleases were involved. Accordingly, the legislature chose to require the courts to consider the giving of notice and other actions the owner may or may not have taken to abate the nuisance when deliberating upon the issue of criminal contempt. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 892 (1979) states:\n\nSuch treatment prevents the imposition of penalty against the owner who may not have technically given notice but who, under peculiar circumstances, may have taken other reasonable and possibly more effective measures to abate the nuisance, and thereby acted in ... good faith.\n\nAct 158, Session Laws 1990, amended §712-1270 to expand the nuisance law to permit closure of premises where drug offenses repeatedly occur. The legislature emphasized that this amendment is not intended to be applied to innocent landlords whose property may be inadvertently involved in drug offenses. Conference Committee Report No. 30.\n\nAct 246, Session Laws 1996, amended § §712-1270 to 712-1280, by, inter alia, allowing any organization to bring a nuisance abatement suit and providing that the court may order that the person causing the nuisance be excluded from the premises under certain conditions. The Act also allowed the abatement of a nuisance that involves the manufacture as well as the distribution of drugs, and made the language in the statutes more consistent and comprehensive by referring to \"buildings\" and \"premises\" as well as a \"place.\" The legislature believed that places used for illicit drugs, prostitution, or pornography were major factors contributing to the decline of neighborhoods, and that permitting any organization to bring a nuisance abatement action and allowing a court to exclude persons causing the nuisance strengthened part IV of chapter 712 to deal with these problems. Conference Committee Report No. 35, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2618.\n\nAct 286, Session Laws 1998, added §712-1270.5 to allow injunctions against entering or residing in any public or private building, premises, or place to issue against the person causing the nuisance. The legislature found that in 1996, Act 246 was passed, which amended various sections in chapter 712. The purpose of Act 246 was to allow organizations to maintain nuisance abatement suits and thereby obtain injunctive relief against persons utilizing certain buildings, premises, or places, to commit offenses against public health and morals. The legislature also found that the department of the prosecuting attorney, relying on Act 246, began to move for injunctions barring prostitutes from certain areas of Waikiki. The legal reasoning upon which Act 246 was applied to prostitutes was that prostitutes who solicit on public streets aggressively hinder both pedestrian and vehicular traffic and harass visitors to the point where their activity becomes a public nuisance. However, the circuit courts denied the motions for injunctions against prostitutes on the grounds that the nuisance abatement statute did not expressly apply to individuals.\n\nIn passing Act 246, the legislature expressly intended that the court could order, as part of the abatement of the nuisance, the exclusion of the person causing the nuisance from the place, building, or premises involved. Act 286 will solve the apparent ambiguity in the law by specifically stating that nothing in the nuisance abatement law prohibits injunctions against persons causing the nuisance. House Standing Committee Report No. 613-98, Conference Committee Report No. 93.\n\nAct 286, Session Laws 1998, amended §712-1271 to provide that no actions authorized under part V of chapter 712 which seeks to abate or prevent a nuisance shall be filed or maintained against the State or any political subdivision thereof. Conference Committee Report No. 93.\n\nAct 286, Session Laws 1998, amended §712-1273 to allow evidence of a person's general reputation to be introduced to prove the existence of a nuisance. Conference Committee Report No. 93.\n\nAct 44, Session Laws 2004, added §712-1270.3 and amended § §712-1276 and 712-1278, to allow citizens to recover attorneys' fees and to receive the same protection as crime victims do. House Standing Committee Report No. 495-04.\n\nAct 123, Session Laws 2005, added §712-1271.5, to establish that a preponderance of the evidence is the standard of proof applicable to nuisance abatement actions, §712-1271.6, to authorize a court to issue a protective order to prevent the disclosure of the identity of a witness when presented with evidence of acts of violence or prior threats of violence by any defendant in a nuisance abatement action, and §712-1277.5, to subject an individual who knowingly violates a protective order to civil as well as criminal contempt of court.\n\nAct 123 also amended § §712-1270.5, 712-1271, 712-1272, 712-1273, 712-1275, and 712-1276 to, among other things, allow injunctions against persons who maintain, aid, abet, or permit a nuisance from entering or residing in any place where the nuisance exists and enable a court to enter an order suspending or revoking any business, professional, operational, or liquor license if the holder of the license is involved in maintaining, aiding, abetting, or permitting the nuisance. The legislature found that the Act would encourage neighborhood residents to report community nuisances such as drug activity by increasing the protections for witnesses in nuisance abatement actions, expanding the scope of injunctions to include persons associated with the nuisance, and providing law enforcement additional tools to abate a nuisance. Conference Committee Report No. 11, House Standing Committee Report No. 1288, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 638.\n\nAct 136, Session Laws 2010, added §712-1281 to subject to forfeiture laws property used or intended to be used and proceeds acquired in the commission or attempted commission of the illegal importation, sale, and transfer of fireworks. Act 136 also amended § §712-1270 and 712-1270.3, respectively, to establish a nuisance action under the Penal Code to abate those activities, and to give citizens who bring an action to abate the activities the same rights and protections of victims and witnesses in criminal proceedings. The legislature found that increasing the penalties for violations of fireworks-related laws may serve to curb rampant illegal fireworks in the State. Conference Committee Report No. 18-10, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3044.\n\nAct 80, Session Laws 2015, amended §712-1270 to promote the enforcement of criminal gambling prohibitions by including gambling among the types of criminal offenses that are subject to the nuisance abatement laws. The legislature found that illegal gambling establishments can generate a large volume of cash and lead to neighborhood and community nuisances by becoming a haven for organized crime. Act 80 supplements existing police efforts by providing an additional tool to remedy illegal activity at specific buildings, premises, or places within the State. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 596, House Standing Committee Report No. 1492.\n\nAct 154, Session Laws 2016, amended §712-1270 to remedy the situation of an unlawful occupation of real property by authorizing civil lawsuits that seek, among other things, an order of abatement that permanently prohibits the trespassers from residing on or entering onto the subject real property. The legislature found that \"squatting,\" to settle on land without title, right, or payment of rent, had become common in certain areas of the State and was a serious nuisance to the owners of the property, adjoining landowners, and neighboring residents. Squatting presented significant legal issues for landowners because the legal process to evict a squatter was costly and time consuming. The problems multiplied when the squatter located on property that had been abandoned by the owner. Because neighboring landowners and residents did not have a property interest in the abandoned parcel, they usually did not have effective legal tools to remove the squatter. There was a lack of effective remedies to protect against noise, drug use, unsanitary conditions, and other illegal activities in their neighborhoods. Conference Committee Report No. 38-16.",
