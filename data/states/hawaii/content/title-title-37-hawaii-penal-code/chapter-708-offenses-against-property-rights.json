As amended in 1974, \"building\" includes any structure, and the term also includes any vehicle, railway car, aircraft, or watercraft used for lodging of persons therein.\n\nIn explaining the change in 1974, the Senate Judiciary Committee in Standing Committee Report No. 1065-74 stated that it was clear the phrase, \"used for lodging of persons therein\" was added by Act 136, Session Laws 1973, \"to modify the terms 'vehicle, railway car, aircraft, or watercraft' and not the word 'structure.' However, it is possible to interpret the present definition as including 'structures' only when 'used for lodging of persons therein.' Such an interpretation means that stores, warehouses, and other commercial buildings not primarily used for the lodging of persons will not be included in the definition of 'building.' As a further result, persons breaking into such places cannot be charged with burglary because the commission of that crime involves breaking into a 'building' as defined in §708-800(1).\"\n\nAct 54, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by adding the definition of \"aquaculture product\" for the purpose of protecting Hawaii's aquaculture industry by deterring theft from aquaculture farms, which could cause devastating losses to research facilities and businesses. House Standing Committee Report No. 1184-92, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1671.\n\nAct 218, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by adding a definition for \"agricultural equipment, supplies, or products.\" The legislature sought to prevent the theft of agricultural equipment, supplies, or products by subjecting violators to a class C felony in §708-831. Conference Committee Report No. 52.\n\nAct 287, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by adding a definition for \"encoding.\" The legislature intended to provide criminal sanctions for the fraudulent encoding of a credit card in §708-8100.5. Conference Committee Report No. 102.\n\nAct 222, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by adding the definition of \"telecommunication service provider\" and by amending the definitions of \"telecommunication service\" and \"telecommunication service device.\" The Act was intended to expand the scope of the law establishing the offense of telecommunication service fraud, to include fraud involving cellular telephone devices and services. The legislature recognized that cellular telephone fraud had become a major problem in the country, increasing consumer costs, and contributing to increased drug-related criminal activity, and that current state law did not provide comprehensive protection for telecommunication services theft. House Standing Committee Report No. 1521-96, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2017.\n\nAct 198, Session Laws 1997, expanded the definition of \"credit card\" to include electronic benefit transfer cards and debit cards, in order to criminalize the fraudulent use of debit and electronic benefit transfer cards under part X of chapter 708. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1547.\n\nAct 45, Session Laws 2002, amended the definition of \"hotel\" to clarify that the definition in relation to offenses against property rights means a structure in which a majority of the tenants are roomers or boarders. The current definition required all tenants to be roomers or boarders. However, hotel structures will rarely be totally occupied by roomers or boarders at the exclusion of commercial tenants such as shops and restaurants. The amended definition would more accurately reflect the current state of hotel operations. House Standing Committee Report No. 176-02, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2461.\n\nAct 224, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by adding the definition of \"personal information.\" The legislature found that misappropriation of personal identification information was on the rise. Act 224 addresses the criminal conduct associated with intentional identity theft. Conference Committee Report No. 25-02.\n\nAct 182, Session Laws 2005, amended the definition of \"agricultural equipment, supplies, or products\" by adding agricultural \"commodities\" in the definition. Act 182 addressed the problem of agricultural theft in Hawaii by amending various provisions of Hawaii's theft laws relating to agricultural livestock and products. Conference Committee Report No. 77, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1359.\n\nAct 139, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by adding the definition of \"confidential personal information.\" Act 139 made it a crime to intentionally or knowingly possess the confidential information of another without that person's authorization. Hawaii law enforcement has found it difficult to curb the rise in identity theft-related crimes when identity thieves in possession of personal information who have not yet caused a monetary loss to the victim cannot be prosecuted for crimes other than petty misdemeanor thefts. The legislature found that amending the law to make intentionally or knowingly possessing the confidential information of another without authorization a class C felony would help to deter identity theft crimes. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2636.\n\nAct 156, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by adding the definition of \"aquacultural equipment, supplies, or products.\" Act 156 established intentionally or knowingly damaging the agricultural or aquacultural equipment, supplies, or products of another as an offense of criminal property damage. The legislature found that increasing the penalties for criminal property damage offenses was consistent with the great impact these crimes have on Hawaii's agricultural and aquacultural industries and the ability of individual farmers and ranchers to earn a living. Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 3021 and 3310.\n\nAct 181, Session Laws 2006, amended the definition of \"widely dangerous means\" by excluding \"fire\" from the definition. Act 181 included arson as a new class of property damage and defined four degrees of the offense of arson with appropriate sanctions. The legislature found that fires that are intentionally set cause extensive damage to public and private properties and threaten lives. Conference Committee Report No. 50-06.\n\nAct 208, Session Laws 2011, amended the definition of \"enter or remain unlawfully\" by deleting the provision that a person who enters or remains on unimproved and apparently unused land that is not fenced or otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders, unless notice against trespass has been given, is allowed to be on the land and is not trespassing. The legislature recognized that, in many cases, trespassers are armed and found many miles from the nearest town or police station, and that in these situations, personal notice is impractical and even dangerous. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1254, Conference Committee Report No. 59.\n\nAct 101, Session Laws 2018, amended the definition of \"confidential personal information\" for offenses against property rights to eliminate unconstitutionally vague provisions, specify other types of confidential personal information, and clarify when a password constitutes confidential personal information. Act 101 conformed the definition to the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision in State v. Pacquing, 139 Haw. 302 (2016), which excised portions of the definition to eliminate unconstitutionally vague provisions under the offense of unauthorized possession of confidential personal information. Conference Committee Report No. 73-18.\n\nAct 21, Session Laws 2021, amended this section to update the definition of \"property\" as it relates to offenses against property rights under the Penal Code to expressly include property stored in an electronic medium. The legislature noted that this definition of \"property\" had not been amended since the enactment of the Penal Code in 1972 and did not properly account for intangible property stored in an electronic format, such as property stored on a computer. The legislature found that in the modern digital age, property that is stored on an electronic device has just as much value as property in hard copy form. The legislature also found that intellectual property should be protected from property theft in the same manner in which prior law protected real and personal property. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1208, House Standing Committee Report No. 736.\n\nDefendant did not intend to permanently deprive car dealership of vehicle where evidence indicated defendant wanted to have new vehicle to drive for weekend then return it when defendant's deception was discovered. 86 H. 207, 948 P.2d 1048 (1997).\n\nWhere defendant returned new vehicle after 72 hour possession and prosecution was unable to prove any economic loss to car dealership, no intent to deprive dealership of significant portion of vehicle's economic value, use, or benefit. 86 H. 207, 948 P.2d 1048 (1997).\n\nInasmuch as the \"intent to defraud\" component of second degree theft by shoplifting, as defined by this section, prescribes two alternative means of establishing the state of mind requisite to the offense of second degree theft by shoplifting, trial court plainly erred in failing to instruct jury as to the alternative states of mind requisite to the charged offense. 101 H. 389, 69 P.3d 517 (2003).\n\nThe alternative states of mind potentially requisite to the charged offense of second degree theft by shoplifting, as prescribed by the definition of \"intent to defraud\" set forth in this section, does not implicate a defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, as guaranteed by article I, § §5 and 14 of the Hawaii constitution; a proper elements instruction, which sets forth the alternative states of mind prescribed by the \"intent to defraud\" component of second degree theft by shoplifting, does not violate defendant's constitutional right. 101 H. 389, 69 P.3d 517 (2003).\n\nWhere petitioner was charged with theft by deception in a situation involving a contract, the intent element of the crime was not met where evidence showed that petitioner performed or intended to perform petitioner's part of the contract; intent element would have only been satisfied if the petitioner intended not to perform petitioner's contractual obligations; further, subsequent breach of the contract may give rise to potential civil remedies grounded in contract law, but unless accompanied by the intent to deprive a complainant's property, the breach does not create criminal liability for theft. 129 H. 414, 301 P.3d 1255 (2013).\n\nShambles and temporary absence not abandonment sufficient to deprive structure of use as a dwelling; a structure, although unoccupied does not become abandoned unless it is \"wholly forsaken or deserted\"; unoccupied house does not cease to be a \"dwelling\" because of the temporary absence of the owner. 2 H. App. 581, 637 P.2d 782 (1981).\n\nNightclub owner's bedroom and bath in separately secured area of club constituted a \"building\" within the meaning of this section. 9 H. App. 307, 837 P.2d 1308 (1992).\n\nOnce erected, a tent is a structure, and thus, a building. 9 H. App. 368, 842 P.2d 267 (1992).\n\nIn prosecution for first degree burglary under §708-810, prosecution satisfied its burden of proving that storage shed was in a garage that was part of a building that was a dwelling. 86 H. 143 (App.), 948 P.2d 564 (1997).",

      "text": "§708-801 Valuation of property or services.Whenever the value of property or services is determinative of the class or grade of an offense, or otherwise relevant to a prosecution, the following shall apply:\n\n(1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, value means the market value of the property or services at the time and place of the offense, or the replacement cost if the market value of the property or services cannot be determined.\n\n(2) Whether or not they have been issued or delivered, certain written instruments, not including those having a readily ascertained market value, shall be evaluated as follows:\n\n(a) The value of an instrument constituting an evidence of debt, such as a check, traveler's check, draft, or promissory note, shall be deemed the amount due or collectible thereon or thereby, that figure ordinarily being the face amount of the indebtedness less any portion thereof that has been satisfied;\n\n(b) The value of any other instrument that creates, releases, discharges, or otherwise affects any valuable legal right, privilege, or obligation shall be deemed the greatest amount of economic loss that the owner of the instrument might reasonably suffer by virtue of the loss of the instrument.\n\n(3) When property or services have value but that value cannot be ascertained pursuant to the standards set forth above, the value shall be deemed to be an amount not exceeding $100.\n\n(4) When acting intentionally or knowingly with respect to the value of property or services is required to establish an element of an offense, the value of property or services shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant believed or knew the property or services to be of that value. When acting recklessly with respect to the value of property or services is sufficient to establish an element of an offense, the value of the property or services shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant acted in reckless disregard of the value.\n\n(5) When acting intentionally or knowingly with respect to the value of property or services is required to establish an element of an offense, it is a defense, which reduces the class or grade of the offense to a class or grade of offense consistent with the defendant's state of mind, that the defendant believed the valuation of the property or services to be less. When acting recklessly with respect to the value of property or services is required to establish an element of an offense, it is a defense that the defendant did not recklessly disregard a risk that the property was of the specified value.\n\n(6) Amounts involved in thefts committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether the property taken be of one person or several persons, may be aggregated in determining the class or grade of the offense. Amounts involved in offenses of criminal property damage committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether the property damaged be of one person or several persons, may be aggregated in determining the class or grade of the offense.

As in the case of statutory definitions, a discussion of the provisions relating to value is found in the commentary on subsequent sections in this chapter.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-801\n\nAct 175, Session Laws 1987, provided for the valuation of property or services under this section to be the replacement cost only if the property cannot be found, or where the value of the property or services cannot be ascertained. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 72, House Conference Committee Report No. 54.\n\nAct 49, Session Laws 1998, clarified that the valuation of property taken in the commission of a theft should be determined by the value of the property \"taken\" rather than the value of the property \"damaged.\" The legislature found that under this section, the law provided that valuation amounts were to be determined by the property \"damaged\" whereas it should logically be determined by the value of the property \"taken.\" The legislature further found that the law needed to be changed to assure that a victim's losses were fairly assessed and adequately compensated. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3230.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by making technical nonsubstantive amendments.\n\nWhere defendant testified that defendant harbored no belief at all regarding the value of the stolen property, paragraph (5) could not afford defendant a mitigating defense to second degree theft under §708-831(1)(b). 90 H. 359, 978 P.2d 797 (1999).\n\nValuation of property as applied to violation of §708-831(1)(b). 1 H. App. 644, 623 P.2d 898 (1981).\n\nDue process right violated where circuit court's instruction to jury regarding the statutory presumption created by paragraph (4) failed to further instruct jury pursuant to HRE rule 306(a) that the presumption is merely a permissible inference of fact and that in order to apply the presumption, the jury must find that the presumed fact exists beyond a reasonable doubt. 88 H. 216 (App.), 965 P.2d 149 (1998).\n\nUnder §702-206, the term \"intentional\", as applied to the value-attendant-circumstance element of the insurance fraud offense under §431:10C-307.7, means \"believes\"; also, paragraph (4) indicates that either a defendant's \"belief\" or \"knowledge\" is sufficient to establish an intentional or knowing state of mind as to the value element; thus, pursuant to §702-204, as a \"reckless\" state of mind was applicable to the value element of the insurance fraud offense, defendant was not exposed to a conviction based on a state of mind lower than what was required. 117 H. 26 (App.), 175 P.3d 136 (2007).",

The prosecution is not required to prove any state of mind with respect to the person's status as a habitual property crime perpetrator. Proof that the person has the requisite minimum prior convictions shall be sufficient to establish this element.\n\n(3) A person commits a property crime if the person engages in conduct that constitutes an offense under this chapter. It can be established that the person has committed a property crime by either the prosecution proving that the person is guilty of or by the person pleading guilty or no contest to committing any offense under this chapter.\n\n(4) Habitual property crime is a class C felony.\n\n(5) For a conviction under this section, the sentence shall be either:\n\n(a) An indeterminate term of imprisonment of five years; provided that the minimum term of imprisonment shall be not less than one year; or\n\n(b) A term of probation of five years, with conditions to include but not be limited to one year of imprisonment; provided that probation shall only be available for a first conviction under this section. [L 2004, c 49, §1; am L 2014, c 118, §1; am L 2016, c 231, §36]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §708-803\n\nAct 49, Session Laws 2004, added this section, establishing the offense of habitual property crime, a class C felony. The legislature found that in 2002, Hawaii ranked first in the nation for property crime rates and second in larceny theft rates, and that a large portion of the crimes are committed by habitual offenders. The legislature also found that Act 49 would punish repeat offenders of property crime. House Standing Committee Report No. 902-4, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2616.\n\nAct 118, Session Laws 2014, amended subsection (4) by clarifying that the sentence for a person convicted of habitual property crime will be: (1) an indeterminate term of imprisonment of five years, with a minimum term of one year; or (2) for a first conviction only, a term of probation of five years, with conditions to include but not be limited to one year of imprisonment. The legislature found that property crimes have been a continual problem in Hawaii. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported in 2012 that Hawaii ranked thirty-one out of fifty-two jurisdictions when it came to the amount of property crimes at a rate per one hundred thousand inhabitants. The legislature strongly supported the services offered through the Judiciary's Hawaii's Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE) Probation program, drug court, mental health court, and veterans treatment court, and suggested, without the intent of limiting the court's discretion, that when sentencing a defendant to a term of probation for conviction of a habitual property crime, the court consider sentencing the defendant to the programs, if appropriate. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3258, Conference Committee Report No. 42-14.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended this section by reducing by one the number of qualifying convictions required to meet the habitual property crime perpetrator status and allowing any offense committed under chapter 708 to qualify. Act 231 also doubled the length of time from five years to ten years that a conviction can qualify a person for habitual theft status, based on the recommendation of the penal code review committee, which was convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015). The legislature concluded that it was necessary to further strengthen this section, the habitual property crime statute. While it is not desirable to incarcerate an individual for stealing items worth $300, the current felony theft threshold, especially when reminded of the fact that each day of incarceration costs Hawaii taxpayers $137 per incarcerated individual, it is important to properly penalize those individuals who have made a career of thievery.

The legislature found that albizia trees are an invasive species that are prone to breaking and falling during high winds and tropical storms and, consequently, pose a hazard to public safety and critical infrastructure. Fallen albizia trees caused power outages and other structural damage on the island of Hawaii during tropical storm Iselle in 2014. Albizia trees fell over highways, roads, and driveways in such large numbers during that storm that many people were left trapped in their homes and rescue personnel were prevented from reaching them or, in some cases, returning to the rescuers' base of operations. The legislature further found that albizia trees located on private properties often create hazardous conditions for adjacent properties that should be prevented wherever possible. Albizia trees have been successfully eradicated on many properties, but some property owners have been unresponsive to inquiries from neighbors and repeated notices to control the trees on their property. Act 13 provided a way for neighbors to control adjacent albizia trees to prevent or address hazardous conditions, subject to certain conditions.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nEvidence adequate to support conviction. 64 H. 226, 638 P.2d 330 (1981).\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §708-810 AND 708-811\n\nIt has been said that the essence of the offense of burglary is \"invasion of premises under circumstances specially likely to terrorize occupants.\"[1] Alternatively, it has been proposed that the primary function of burglary statutes is to crystallize the doctrine of attempt in situations of criminal trespass.[2] The former view implies that the offense is conceived of, in part, although not necessarily defined in terms of a harm to personal dignity and sense of safety. With respect to the second view, the need to crystallize the doctrine of attempt in cases involving criminal trespass is largely obviated by this Code's clear treatment of the doctrine of attempt.[3] However, despite the absence of clearly articulated substantive reasons for making burglary a separate offense, the Code defers to the overwhelming body of decisional and statutory law recognizing this crime.[4] In the words of the Model Penal Code commentary,\n\nIf we were writing on a clean slate, the best solution might be to eliminate burglary as a distinct offense. ... But we are not writing on a clean slate. Centuries of history and a deeply embedded Anglo-American conception like burglary cannot easily be discarded. The needed reform must therefore take the direction of narrowing the offense to something like the distinctive situation for which it was originally devised: invasion of premises under circumstances specially likely to terrorize occupants.[5]\n\nThe Code rejects the division of burglary into three degrees of offense,[6] and follows the Model Penal Code approach of dividing the offense into two degrees and treating the generally recognized aggravating circumstances as of roughly equal significance.[7] Thus, either (a) possessing a dangerous instrument, or (b) inflicting or attempting to inflict bodily injury, or (c) recklessly disregarding the risk that the building is a dwelling is sufficient to aggravate the class C offense and make it a class B offense.\n\nPreviously, Hawaii law defined burglary as the entry of a building or other structure of various descriptions, with intent to commit larceny of the first or second degree or to commit any felony.[8] If the conduct occurred at night, with the possession of a deadly weapon, or in a legally-occupied building or structure, the offense was burglary in the first degree.[9] All other burglary was burglary in the second degree.[10]\n\nThe previous Hawaii definitions were similar to those adopted by this Code. The Code covers both \"entering and remaining unlawfully\" upon premises; and the definition of this phrase is provided by §708-800. The Code alters the circumstances that aggravate the offense and make it burglary in the first degree. Committing the offense while armed with a dangerous instrument remains an aggravating circumstance. The Code, however, gives no significance to the time of the occurrence of the event. Unlike prior law, the Code makes it an aggravating circumstance to inflict or attempt to inflict bodily injury during the course of the offense. Rather than have the degree of the offense turn on the fortuitous circumstance of whether the structure happened to be occupied, the Code makes it an aggravating circumstance if the structure is a dwelling and the defendant is culpable in this regard.\n\nAnother substantive change is the reduction of penalty. It is felt that this reduction reflects the desire to treat different offenses separately. To the extent that actual harm or theft do occur, they may be dealt with under appropriate sections of the Code: where they are absent, it is felt that the prior law's provisions for a possible twenty-year sentence11 was too severe for an offense which may involve no major injury other than unpermitted entry.\n\n§ §708-810 And 708-811 Commentary:\n\n1. M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 11, comments at 57 (1960).\n\n2. Prop. Mich. Rev. Cr. Code, comments at 200; cf. commentary on § §708-813 and 814, this Code.\n\n3. Cf. § §705-500 through 502, and commentary thereon. However, it must be noted that simultaneous convictions for criminal trespass and attempt of another offense would yield concurrent rather than consecutive sentences, and, in most cases, not the kind of penalty commensurate with the view of burglary as a crystallization of the doctrine of attempt in aggravated cases. Still, one might argue that whatever special aggravation arises out of the conjunction of criminal trespass and criminal attempt (and it is difficult to find a rational articulation of this aggravation) ought to be dealt with individually, according to the actual and potential harms involved in each instance, rather than on a wholesale basis which ignores individual differences.\n\n4. Both the Model Penal Code and the Proposed Michigan Revised Criminal Code adopt this approach; see M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 11, comments at 57-58 (1960), and Prop. Mich. Rev. Cr.

The person who possesses the designated type of device with intent to use the same in the proscribed manner is covered--and so is the manufacturer, distributor, and transporter who deals in such devices if he possesses the same with knowledge \"that some person intends ultimately to use it\" in the commission of one or more of the offenses for which it is adapted, designed, or commonly used.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law did not have an independent offense dealing with possession of burglar's tools; this section, therefore, represents an addition to our law.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-812\n\nAct 221, Session Laws 1978, inserted the provisions relating to master keys to help curb burglaries involving the use of such keys, which activities the legislature found to be a significant problem particularly in hotels and apartment buildings.\n\nSubsection (1)(a) not unconstitutionally overbroad where defendant's challenge to subsection (1)(a) was grounded in hypothetical conduct in which defendant was not involved. 104 H. 462, 92 P.3d 471 (2004).\n\nSubsection (1)(a) not unconstitutionally vague as it describes the proscribed conduct in ordinary and understandable terms specifying the type of items to be possessed and limiting and defining the offenses to which this section applies to those involving forcible entry into premises or theft by physical taking; it also adequately informs a person on how to avoid committing the offense by not employing the items with the culpable intent set forth in this section. 104 H. 462, 92 P.3d 471 (2004).\n\nConviction under subsection (1)(a) cannot be sustained unless the State establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed an explosive, tool, instrument, or other article; had knowledge that the tools could be used to commit a burglary; and had the intent to use the tools, or knew that some other person intended to use the tools to commit a burglary. 97 H. 323 (App.), 37 P.3d 572 (2001).",

      "text": "§708-815 Simple trespass.(1) A person commits the offense of simple trespass if the person knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in or upon premises.\n\n(2) Simple trespass is a violation. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nWhere defendant requested court to instruct jury on time-barred lesser included offense of simple trespass under this section, defendant waived statute of limitations under §701-114(1)(e). 87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865 (1997).\n\nWhere police had probable cause to arrest defendant without a warrant for fourth degree theft, a petty misdemeanor under §708-833, and simple trespass, a violation under this section, and §803-6 authorized them to cite, rather than arrest, defendant for those offenses if defendant did not have any outstanding arrest warrants, outstanding warrant check on defendant by police not unconstitutional. 91 H. 111 (App.), 979 P.2d 1137 (1999).\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §708-813 TO 708-815\n\nThe essence of the offense of criminal trespass is \"entering and remaining unlawfully,\" as defined by §708-800. It is basic to the offense that the actor have some knowledge that the actor's presence on the premises is not licensed, invited, or privileged.\n\nUnder that definition, a person does not transgress when he enters or stays in a place open at the time to the public, unless he is specifically warned not to enter or remain. The fact that some portions of the premises were open to the public, including the defendant, does not mean that he has a privilege with reference to closed-off portions.[1]\n\nThe simple offense (i.e., §708-815) is defined in terms of entering or remaining on premises with knowledge of this fact (\"...the person knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in or upon premises\"). Simple trespass is a violation.\n\nTwo degrees of aggravated trespass are provided by the Code. The most serious aggravation occurs when the trespass is to a dwelling as defined by §708-800. Section 708-813 (criminal trespass in the first degree), makes this offense a misdemeanor. \"The alarm caused to inhabitants by the entry, and the likelihood of violence which may injure someone, including the intruder, are sufficient to warrant increased penalties.\"[2] A second, less serious aggravation, occurs when the premises are enclosed or fenced. Under §708-814 (criminal trespass in the second degree), this kind of trespass is made a petty misdemeanor.\n\nAct 55, Session Laws 1974, amended §708-813(1), relating to criminal trespass in the first degree, by making it an offense for a person to knowingly enter or remain unlawfully in or upon the premises of a hotel or apartment building in addition to a dwelling. The law was changed primarily to deal with the problem of prostitution in hotels and apartments. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 699-74. Section 708-813 was also amended by Act 32, Session Laws 1975, which added subsection (2). The purpose of the new language was to aid ranchers in proceeding against rustlers. The legislature found that it was difficult to catch rustlers in the act. Under the new subsection, one apprehended in an enclosed area in possession of a firearm could be punished as a misdemeanant.\n\nAct 49, Session Laws 1974, amended §708-814, criminal trespass in the second degree, to include the situation where a person is unlawfully on school premises and refuses to leave after reasonable warning or request to leave. In explaining the change, the House Committee on Judiciary and Corrections in Standing Committee Report No. 727-74 stated:\n\nYour Committee understands that there are some schools without fences and under present statutes, persons trespassing on such premises commit the offense of simple trespass. Simple trespass is a violation and is enforceable only by means of a penal summons. Your Committee finds that persons trespassing on school premises, whether fenced or unfenced, should be subject to the offense of criminal trespass in the second degree, a petty misdemeanor.\n\nWhere adverse circumstances, e.g., flood, storm, etc., require one to take refuge upon the premises of another, such action is not penal because it comes within the choice of evils justification set forth in §703-302.\n\nAny trespass statute which is applied in situations involving political or religious solicitation becomes subject to constitutional scrutiny. As the drafters of the Proposed Michigan Revised Criminal Code, one of the sources from which this chapter of the Code is derived, noted:\n\nThis activity does not fall within §[708-815] because (a) in most instances the entry is privileged by custom and therefore is not unlawful within the definition of 'enter or remain unlawfully' in §[708-800], if the owner does not post his premises or give specific notice to the religious or campaign worker to stay off or leave the premises there is no change in the customary law, and (b) even if the owner does not desire the person to enter, the latter does not 'know' within the meaning of §[702-206(2)(b)] that he is entering or remaining unlawfully unless the notice is communicated to him. If he forces his way into an enclosure that is posted or into a dwelling, with the knowledge that his presence is not wanted he fits the language of § §[708-813 to 815], but can still contend that the statute as to him under the circumstances infringes on his freedoms of speech or religion. Even if he prevails with regard to the prosecution against him, however, this does not void the statute as far as cases not involving these freedoms are concerned, under well-established constitutional case law.[3]\n\nPrevious Hawaii law imposed a single low-grade misdemeanor sanction for trespass.[4] The offense was not differentiated, as in the Code, and did not account adequately for the varying circumstances in which trespass may arise.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §708-813 TO 708-815\n\nAct 201, Session Laws 1979, added §708-814(c) to upgrade the penalty for the acts referred to from a violation to a petty misdemeanor. The legislature found that the police would not place persons charged with simple trespass under physical arrest without a penal summons being first obtained. In upgrading the offense, the legislature sought to give retailers a more effective means of removing persons who harass or inconvenience customers or cause a loss of sales. House Standing Committee Report No. 984.\n\nAct 177, Session Laws 1981, rearranged the former text and added subsection (1)(c) to §708-813, formerly §708-814(1)(b), thereby upgrading trespass upon school premises from a petty misdemeanor to a misdemeanor. The increase in penalty was designed to curb vandalism and violence on school campuses, much of which appeared to be caused by person unlawfully there. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 720, House Standing Committee Report No. 627.\n\nAct 89, Session Laws 1996, amended §708-813(1) by clarifying that the provisions of the subsection pertain to both public and private schools. Conference Committee Report No. 64.\n\nAct 146, Session Laws 1998, addressed the problem of trespassing and amended §708-814 by requiring that written warnings to leave be given by the owner or lessee of the premises or their agent, or by a police officer. In State v. Sadler, 80 H. 372, 375 (1996), the Hawaii intermediate court of appeals held that the offense of criminal trespass in the second degree under §708-814(1)(b) \"contemplates a warning or request contemporaneous with a person entering or remaining unlawfully on the premises.\" Therefore, in order to convict a person for criminal trespass in the second degree, the person must refuse a warning or request to leave that is made contemporaneously with the person's entering or remaining on the premises. The legislature found that under the court's interpretation of the current law, as long as a trespasser left the premises immediately upon being ordered to do so, the trespasser could return that same day with no fear of arrest. The interpretation was burdensome on commercial establishments because owners and operators were unable to meaningfully evict trespassers who may interfere with business and commit property crimes. Conference Committee Report No. 81, House Standing Committee Report No. 711-98.\n\nAct 200, Session Laws 2000, among other things, amended §708-813(1) by qualifying that the pre-arrest warning requirement is excepted between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., when most persons have no legitimate purpose on campus. House Standing Committee Report No. 1283-00.\n\nAct 50, Session Laws 2004, amended §708-814(1) to protect public property from trespassers by applying the offense of criminal trespass in the second degree, a petty misdemeanor, to persons who enter or remain unlawfully on any public property after a reasonable warning or request to leave has been given by the owner or lessee of the property. House Standing Committee Report No. 901-04.\n\nAct 181, Session Laws 2005, amended §708-814 by specifying that a person commits criminal trespass in the second degree if the person enters or remains on agricultural lands without the permission of the owner of the land, the owner's agent, or the person in lawful possession of the land. Agricultural theft is a critical problem for Hawaii's farmers, who are especially vulnerable to theft since farms are usually located on large plots of land in sparsely populated areas, isolated from law enforcement. Although many farms have fences and other simple barriers surrounding their property, the obstacles are easily overcome by thieves and do little to deter trespassing. Conference Committee Report No. 78, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1164.\n\nAct 212, Session Laws 2005, established the petty misdemeanor offense of criminal trespass onto public parks and recreational grounds ( §708-814.5). Act 212 also repealed the amendments made to the offense of criminal trespass in the second degree ( §708-814) by Act 50, Session Laws 2004. Act 50 was intended to address the problem of squatters in public parks or campgrounds, but the law was being broadly used in circumstances not related to squatting. Conference Committee Report No. 82.\n\nAct 208, Session Laws 2011, amended §708-814(1) by prohibiting a person from entering or remaining unlawfully on unimproved or unused lands that are fenced, enclosed, or clearly marked by signage. Act 208 also added entering or remaining on agricultural lands that are fallow or have evidence of livestock at the time of entry to the offense of trespass in the second degree. The legislature found that trespassing is a major problem for owners of unimproved or unused land. Trespassers often damage property and crops and increase the liability of the owners of the land. Trespassers also use unimproved and unused lands as illegal dump sites and places to conduct illicit activities. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 830, House Standing Committee Report No. 934.\n\nAct 145, Session Laws 2013, amended §708-814 to: (1) broaden the offense of criminal trespass in the second degree to include a person who enters or remains unlawfully in or upon the premises of any public housing project after a reasonable warning or request to leave by housing authorities or a police officer; (2) clarify that the warning or request to leave would not be necessary between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. at any public housing project that is closed to the public during those hours and has signs of a certain size and placement to provide sufficient notice of the closure; and (3) define \"housing authorities.\" The legislature found that the Hawaii public housing authority continues to make improvements to security measures at many of the high risk housing projects, including the addition of fences, security fences, and photo identification cards for tenants. The legislature further found that Act 145 would significantly improve the ability of the authority to ensure a secure, livable community for residents. Conference Committee Report No. 32, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1333.\n\nAct 101, Session Laws 2015, amended § §708-813 and 708-814 to shield process servers performing their duties from prosecution under criminal trespass statutes when they enter premises that are not secured by a fence or a locked gate. The legislature found that process servers are an important part of the judicial process. Act 101 allowed process servers to enter or remain in or upon the premises of another for the purpose of making a good faith attempt to serve process upon certain individuals. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1363, Conference Committee Report No. 22.\n\nAct 136, Session Laws 2017, amended §708-814 by clarifying the signage posting requirements that provide notice to a person entering or remaining unlawfully on agricultural lands or unimproved or unused lands without permission and to a person entering or remaining unlawfully in or upon the premises of any public housing project or state low-income housing project. Act 136 also added §708-814.7, which establishes the offense of criminal trespass onto state lands to prohibit a person from entering or remaining unlawfully in or upon any improved state land, or in or upon any state land on or under any highway, subject to certain conditions and exemptions. The legislature found that it was unclear whether existing criminal trespass laws applied to improved state lands, state land on or under any highway, or unfenced, unenclosed, or unsecured agricultural lands owned by the State. Act 136 addressed the application of criminal trespass laws with respect to state lands to provide a stronger and clearer deterrent to illegal activity. Conference Committee Report No. 41, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 719.\n\nAct 31, Session Laws 2018, amended §708-814 to clarify that a person commits criminal trespass in the second degree if the person enters or remains: (1) unlawfully in areas of a housing project that are closed to the public; or (2) in violation of a written warning or request to leave the housing project. The legislature found that one of the greatest concerns and priorities of the Hawaii public housing authority is the safety and well-being of its tenants and staff. However, there had been a number of incidents occurring on housing project properties due to the presence of uninvited individuals, including unauthorized individuals entering onto public housing property and setting up tents in the middle of the property or causing property damage, or evicted tenants returning to the property to harass or intimidate their former neighbors. These activities create conflict among the tenants as well as staff. Accordingly, Act 31 provided the Hawaii public housing authority with a tool to address and resolve these matters. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3432, Conference Committee Report No. 38-18.\n\nAct 245, Session Laws 2019, amended §708-814 to specify that, for purposes of making a complaint for criminal trespass in the second degree on commercial premises, a prior \"reasonable warning or request\" to leave the premises may be evidenced by a copy of the previously issued written warning or request, whether or not the copy is posted at the premises or retained by the county police department. The legislature found that the execution of criminal trespass laws for persons who have entered or remained unlawfully on another's commercial property had become unnecessarily complex. Police officers enforcing the law against a person who had previously been issued a reasonable warning or request to leave and who subsequently violated that warning or request sometimes required the owner or lessee of the commercial premises to be present and in possession of the original copy of the prior written warning or request to leave before allowing a complaint to be made. Act 245 clarified that a copy of a reasonable warning or request is sufficient for purposes of making a complaint for criminal trespass in the second degree on commercial premises, albeit the legislature noted that the original reasonable warning or request must have been legitimate for a copy of that request to suffice for the purposes of making a complaint. Conference Committee Report No. 6, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 771.\n\nAct 209, Session Laws 2023, amended § §708-13 and 708-14 to shield professional land surveyors and their assistants from prosecution under criminal trespass laws when performing their duties. The legislature found that there is a public interest in maintaining a sound and uniform real property system by surveying common property boundaries. Professional land surveyors often require the right to access private property for the purposes of producing a thorough and complete land survey. To properly conduct their surveys, professional land surveyors need access to adjoining lands to record boundary lines, recover or reestablish boundary monuments or survey controls, and locate rights-of-way or improvements with positional discrepancies. However, without a right of entry, a professional land surveyor conducting a land survey is subject to trespass laws. The legislature additionally found that the current practice was for surveyors to verbally ask for permission to enter a property for the purpose of surveying; however, sometimes obtaining verbal permission was not an option. Accordingly, Act 209 protected the surveyor from liability while informing the property owner of the proposed survey. Conference Committee Report No. 30, House Standing Committee Report No. 1867, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 858, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 588, House Standing Committee Report No. 1380.\n\nAct 228, Session Laws 2023, added §708-814.8 to clarify that when trespass involves public land, all state and county law enforcement officers may enforce trespass laws, without regard to whether the land is owned by the State or by a county. The legislature found that jurisdictional uncertainties limited cooperation between county and state law enforcement officers to effectively remove trespassers from public property. This uncertainty could lead to damage to public land and harm to those who use it. Act 228 made it clear that either state or county law enforcement could enforce trespass laws regardless of which governmental entity owns or controls a parcel of public land, which would ensure that the public can enjoy public land safely.

This addition provides that traveling to or from the beach over government land does not constitute trespass and is a defense to § §708-814 and 815. Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-816\n\nAct 13, Session Laws 2019, amended this section to provide a defense to prosecution for simple trespass and criminal trespass in the second degree for a property owner or agent who enters adjacent vacant property under certain conditions, including consulting with a tree arborist and providing written notice, to control albizia trees before the trees become hazardous. The legislature found that albizia trees are an invasive species that are prone to breaking and falling during high winds and tropical storms and, consequently, pose a hazard to public safety and critical infrastructure. Fallen albizia trees caused power outages and other structural damage on the island of Hawaii during tropical storm Iselle in 2014. Albizia trees fell over highways, roads, and driveways in such large numbers during that storm that many people were left trapped in their homes and rescue personnel were prevented from reaching them or, in some cases, returning to the rescuers' base of operations. The legislature further found that albizia trees located on private properties often create hazardous conditions for adjacent properties that should be prevented wherever possible. Albizia trees have been successfully eradicated on many properties, but some property owners have been unresponsive to inquiries from neighbors and repeated notices to control the trees on their property. Act 13 provided a way for neighbors to control adjacent albizia trees to prevent or address hazardous conditions, subject to certain conditions.

Dispensed with are archaic labels such as \"arson\" and \"criminal mischief.\" The offense of criminal property damage is divided into four degrees which represent gradations of penalty depending on: (1) the culpability of the actor (i.e., whether the actor acts intentionally or merely recklessly), (2) the means used (i.e., whether the means present potential danger of widespread damage to persons or property), and (3) the value of the property damaged.\n\nSection 708-800 provides some relevant statutory definitions. \"Property\" is defined, in §708-800, basically, as \"any money, personal property, real property, thing in action, evidence of debt or contract, or article of value of any kind.\" \"Property of another\" is defined, in §708-800, to mean \"property which any person, other than the defendant, has possession of or any other interest in, even though that possession is unlawful.\" A security interest in property, however, does not make the holder thereof any \"owner\" of an interest for purposes of this chapter. [See §708-800.]\n\nThe determination of value is governed by §708-801. When value cannot be determined according to the rules provided by subsections (1) and (2) of §708-801, subsection (3) provides that the value shall be deemed to be not more than $50, therefore limiting conviction to the lowest degree of the offense when the value of property constitutes an element. Section 708-801(4) provides that the value of property is prima facie evidence that the defendant possessed the requisite culpability with respect thereto. Section 708-801(5) affords the defendant a defense, which reduces the degree of the offense, based on the lack of the requisite culpability with respect to the value of the property involved in the offense--when the factor is an element of the offense. Section 708-801(6) provides that amounts involved in separate offenses committed pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct may be aggregated in determining value.\n\nCriminal property damage in the first degree, §708-820, presents the most aggravated form of property damage: damage which carries with it an incidental risk of danger to the person. Under former formulations of property offenses, arson, which is sometimes regarded as an offense against the person, was regarded as the most serious property offense deserving the most severe sanction. Yet actual risk of danger to another was not required for conviction of arson, and it is possible to think of many cases in which, although fire is not the method used in causing the damage, actual risk to the safety of another would result from property damage. The conjunction of property damage and risk to the person is made a separate offense which, because of the cumulative dangers involved, is punished more severely than the offense of reckless endangering.[1] If the conduct places another in danger, it is not required for conviction under §708-820 that the property damaged be that of another; any property damage will suffice.\n\nSection 708-821, criminal property damage in the second degree, covers damage aggravated by three factors: intentional behavior on the part of the actor, and either a potential of widespread damage or a high value of the property. Subsection (1)(a) incorporates the traditional offense of arson and, in addition, would cover other property damage by \"means capable of causing potential widespread injury or damage.\" The Code employs the phrase \"widely dangerous means,\" defined in §708-800, to cover, in addition to fire, such methods of damage as floods, avalanche, and radioactive material. It is the potential for indiscriminate destruction that is the gravamen of this offense. It seems clear that separate, but substantially similar, methods of property damage should not constitute separately defined offenses merely for the sake of preserving old labels and phrases. It should be pointed out that under §708-821(1)(a), unlike §708-820, another person need not actually be placed in danger of death or bodily injury by the actor's conduct. Subsection (1)(b) seeks to differentiate the degree of the offense on the basis of the value of property damaged. As one of the factors differentiating the seriousness of similar offenses, the value of the property involved has traditionally been considered in theft offenses. It seems here no less applicable. Accordingly, theft and property damage offenses are correlated to the extent the value of the property involved is a governing factor.\n\nSection 708-822, criminal property damage in the third degree, reduces the grade of the offense to a misdemeanor if the actor recklessly damages the property of another, without the other's consent, by the use of widely dangerous means, or if the actor intentionally damages such property, the value of which exceeds $50. At common law arson was an intentional offense. Subsection (1)(a) in part extends the arson offense, but subsection (2) provides a reduced penalty, reflecting a lesser degree of culpability. Subsection (1)(b) imposes misdemeanor liability for intentional property damage based in part on the value of the property involved. It is part of the differentiation referred to above and must be compared with § §708-821(1)(b) and 823.\n\nSection 708-823 provides a residual property damage offense and is graded a petty misdemeanor. The damage must be intentional; however, the property damaged may be of any value.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law was rather typical of the confused state of decisional and statutory law regarding offenses of property damage.[2] The Hawaii Revised Statutes recognized no less than six offenses predicated on damage by fire: two degrees of arson, three degrees of malicious burning, and a separate offense of wilful burning with intent to injure an insurer.[3] Such fine distinctions were required as to whether the act was done by day or night, the value of the property damaged, and the nature of the property damaged (e.g., which range from the inhabited dwelling house of another to any wood, field, grass or standing product of the soil). A separate offense, in a different chapter, resulting in a less severe sentence, was provided if the defendant chose to use explosives.[4] Property damage not involving what the Code has called \"widely dangerous means\" was labeled malicious injury and was made a misdemeanor under previous law; the offense was not differentiated on the basis of the value of the property involved. This Code attempts to greatly simplify, clarify, and rationalize the wide range of property damage offenses in the prior law.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §708-820 TO 708-823\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, amended §708-822 by increasing the dollar amount of the property involved in the offense of criminal property damage. The previous figure ($50) was designated in 1972 when the Code was first codified. With the increase, the dollar amount will more accurately reflect current property values and consequently the offense will warrant the level of culpability intended when it was originally drafted. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 820-86.\n\nAct 170, Session Laws 1996, amended §708-820 by making damage to property in an amount exceeding $20,000 criminal property damage in the first degree. Prosecution is permitted for damage to property in the stated amount as a class B felony, consistent with other class B felony threshold amounts found in other crimes in the penal code. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2599.\n\nAct 170, Session Laws 1996, amended § §708-821 and 708-822 by raising the property damage thresholds from $500 to $1,500 for criminal property damage in the second degree ( §708-821), a class C felony, and from $100 to $500 for criminal property damage in the third degree ( §708-822), a misdemeanor. The legislature found that with the inflation of prices and services over the years, the amounts used to repair damages did not properly reflect the seriousness of the cases involved, as many cases involved damages to vehicles that may cost up to $1,000 for repairs. The legislature also found that the present threshold amounts did not accurately reflect the proper values for class C felony and misdemeanor property damage. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2599, House Standing Committee Report No. 196-96.\n\nAct 19, Session Laws 2003, amended § §708-820 and 708-821 to include \"knowingly\" as a state of mind alternative for the crimes of criminal property damage in the first or second degree. The legislature found that there are cases where the defendant is aware that property damage will occur as a result of the defendant's action but intentional property damage is not the motivating factor for the action. The legislature believed that in these cases, defendants should be held accountable for their actions and found that including the word \"knowingly\" as a state of mind alternative would accomplish this goal. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 591, House Standing Committee Report No. 1257.\n\nAct 116, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-820, expanding the offense of criminal property damage in the first degree to include intentionally or knowingly damaging the property of another during a civil defense emergency or during a period of disaster relief. Act 116 penalized the commission of certain crimes during a time of a civil defense emergency proclaimed by the governor or during a period of disaster relief. The legislature found that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita created situations that highlighted the prevalence of opportunistic crimes that can occur during these times. When resources are needed to restore law and order, emergency response aid to victims may be hampered or delayed, leaving victims at an increased risk of bodily injury or death. Stronger measures to control law and order may deter looting and other crimes. Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 2938 and 3302, Conference Committee Report No. 64-06.\n\nAct 156, Session Laws 2006, amended § §708-820, 708-821, and 708-822 to protect Hawaii's agricultural and aquacultural industries by establishing that a person commits the offense of criminal property damage: (1) in the first degree, if the person intentionally or knowingly damages the agricultural or aquacultural equipment, supplies, or products of another without the other's consent, in an amount exceeding $1,500, provided that the value of future crops that were damaged is included in calculating the damage; (2) in the second degree, if the person intentionally or knowingly damages the agricultural or aquacultural equipment, supplies, or products of another without the other's consent, in an amount exceeding $500, provided that the value of future crops that were damaged is included in calculating the damage; and (3) in the third degree, if the person intentionally damages the agricultural or aquacultural equipment, supplies, or products of another without the other's consent, in an amount exceeding $100, provided that the value of future crops that were damaged is included in calculating the damage. The legislature found that increasing the penalties for criminal property damage offenses was consistent with the great impact the crimes have on Hawaii's agricultural and aquacultural industries and the ability of individual farmers and ranchers to earn a living. Conference Committee Report No. 74-06, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3310.\n\nAct 181, Session Laws 2006, amended § §708-820, 708-821, 708-822, and 708-823 by excluding property damage caused by means of fire from the offenses of criminal property damage in the first, second, third, and fourth degrees. Act 181 included arson as a new class of property damage and defined four degrees of the offense of arson with appropriate sanctions. The legislature found that fires that are intentionally set cause extensive damage to public and private properties and threaten lives. Conference Committee Report No. 50-06.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-822(1), by making it an offense of criminal property damage in the third degree, to knowingly damage the property of another without consent and in an amount exceeding $500. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-823(1), by making it an offense of criminal property damage in the fourth degree, to knowingly damage the property of another without consent.\n\nAct 98, Session Laws 2007, amended § §708-820(1), 708-821(1), and 708-822(1) by clarifying the calculation of the value of damage to agricultural products to include future losses and the loss of future production. The legislature found that vandalism, theft, and arson are critical problems with a significant impact upon Hawaii's agricultural industry. Act 98 would strengthen the present law in calculating damages. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1606, House Standing Committee Report No. 459.\n\nAct 111, Session Laws 2014, which amended §708-820(1), updated and recodified Hawaii's emergency management laws to conform with nationwide emergency management practices by, among other things, establishing a Hawaii emergency management agency in the state department of defense with the functions and authority currently held by the state civil defense agency; establishing the power and authority of the director of Hawaii emergency management, who will be the adjutant general, and providing the director with the functions and authority currently held by the director of civil defense; establishing county emergency management agencies, each to be under the respective county mayor's direction, with the functions and authority currently held by the local organizations for civil defense; and repealing the chapters on disaster relief [chapter 127] and the civil defense [and] emergency act chapter 128, which were determined to be obsolete with the creation of the Hawaii emergency management agency.

When a defendant who is convicted of property damage by graffiti is sentenced to remove graffiti within the same area where the defendant defaced the property of others, a defendant performs a valuable community service while gaining a direct understanding of the time and effort required by property owners and community members to restore what may take only minutes to vandalize.

This offense combines the Model Penal Code's offenses of \"Failure to Control or Report a Dangerous Fire\" and \"Failure to Prevent Catastrophe.\"[1] The underlying premise is that a citizen's criminal liability for potential widespread destruction arises from the citizen's tortious or contractual liability with regard to the potential harm.\n\nHawaii previously had no statute dealing generally with the problems of catastrophe and the mitigation of the risk thereof but rather dealt separately with various substantive acts which represented a general public danger. The only general heading under which such offenses were grouped is \"common nuisance,\" which included such widely dangerous aspects as spreading disease, making and storing gunpowder, blasting with explosives, and keeping dangerous animals.[2] In a similar vein, however, Hawaii provided a misdemeanor sanction for the failure of any able-bodied person to help combat a fire.3 In simplifying and combining the above-mentioned sections of the Model Penal Code, this Code fills an apparently neglected area of Hawaii law.\n\n§708-824 Commentary:\n\n1.

(1) Harm may result from meddling with, but not damaging, property which provides a service, thus altering the availability of the service. For example an electrical switch could be turned and the flow of electrical power curtailed. (2) Slight damage to property which provides a service would not, in many cases, if handled solely as an offense of criminal property damage under § §708-820 through 823, reflect the magnitude of social harm involved.\n\nSection 708-826 provides misdemeanor liability for the most aggravated form of tampering: intentional interference with a public utility defined in §708-825(2) to include a common carrier or an institution providing health or safety services for the purpose and with the result of causing substantial interruption or impairment of service furnished by the utility or institution.\n\nA petty misdemeanor offense is provided by §708-827 where the circumstances are less aggravated. Under subsection (1)(a) the definition requires that the actor intend to cause substantial inconvenience; however, the offense is inchoate in the sense that the actor need not be successful. Moreover, the inconvenience need not be aimed at more than one person, and the property tampered with need not be that of a utility or institution providing protected services. Under subsection (1)(b) liability is imposed for tampering with a public utility without its consent. Actual interference with the operation of the utility need not be shown.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law contained no specific prohibitions of the sort contemplated by the present section.",

This form of interference with the use of property can be significantly grave to warrant the low grade of criminal sanction provided by this section.\n\nUnder previous Hawaii law, the conduct described in this section would fall within the ambit of the indiscriminately-defined offense of common nuisance.1 The Code sharpens the focus and definition of the offense, as it relates to noxious substances, and reduces slightly the possible penalty.\n\n§708-828 Commentary:\n\n1.

Litter is broadly defined in subsection (2). The offense constitutes a diminishment of the aesthetic value and enjoyment of property. Although water, e.g., a lake, pond, or stream, constitutes property, it is included separately in the definition of the offense on the theory that the greater clarity achieved is worth the minor redundancy.\n\nThe previous law only covered criminal littering insofar as it related to highways.1 This section of the Code extends the offense to areas other than public highways. In so doing, it represents an addition. However, even as it relates to highways, the Code greatly simplifies and clarifies prior law.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-829\n\nSubsection (4) was added by Act 154, Session Laws 1975. The Legislature found that the punishment for littering was often not a sufficient deterrent and concluded that requiring an offender to actually pick up litter would be more effective. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 501.\n\nAct 60, Session Laws 1979, amended the definition of litter to conform to the definition in chapter 339.\n\nAct 97, Session Laws 1985, amended this section to: (1) except certain conduct from the criminal littering definition; and (2) allow anyone littering property to avoid conviction by affirmatively proving that the littering is consented to by the property owner. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 609, House Standing Committee Report No. 878.\n\nAct 116, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by establishing a minimum fine of $25 for litter violations and a penalty of four hours of litter pickup work or community service for the first offense and eight hours for any subsequent offense. The legislature felt that the setting of a minimum fine and penalty serve as a more effective deterrent than having no minimum fine and penalty. House Standing Committee Report No. 1179-92, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 461.\n\nAct 158, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by increasing the mandatory minimum criminal fine from $25 to $500 and the mandatory maximum criminal fine from $500 to $1,000. The legislature found that many Hawaii communities suffer from serious littering problems. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of enforcement and fines for littering that are insufficient to deter violators. Act 158 added \"teeth\" to the littering laws and provided a substantial deterrent to litter violators, by increasing the fines for littering.

A person obtains, or exerts control over, the property of another by deception with intent to deprive the other of the property.\n\n(3) Appropriation of property.

A person intentionally obtains services, known by the person to be available only for compensation, by deception, false token, or other means to avoid payment for the services. When compensation for services is ordinarily paid immediately upon the rendering of them, absconding without payment or offer to pay is prima facie evidence that the services were obtained by deception.\n\n(5) Diversion of services.

It does not matter that it is impossible to identify particular property as belonging to the victim at the time of the defendant's failure to make the required payment or disposition. A person's status as an officer or employee of the government or a financial institution is prima facie evidence that the person knows the person's legal obligations with respect to making payments and other dispositions. If the officer or employee fails to pay or account upon lawful demand, or if an audit reveals a falsification of accounts, it shall be prima facie evidence that the officer or employee has intentionally dealt with the property as the officer's or employee's own.\n\n(b) A person obtains personal services from an employee upon agreement or subject to a known legal obligation to make a payment or other disposition of funds to a third person on account of the employment, and the person intentionally fails to make the payment or disposition at the proper time.\n\n(7) Receiving stolen property. A person intentionally receives, retains, or disposes of the property of another, knowing that it has been stolen, with intent to deprive the owner of the property.

a proper elements instruction, which sets forth the alternative states of mind prescribed by the \"intent to defraud\" component of second degree theft by shoplifting, does not violate defendant's constitutional right. 101 H. 389, 69 P.3d 517 (2003).\n\nFor purposes of the tolling provisions of §701-108(3)(a), the fraudulent component of subsection (2) is the use of deception in the taking of property. 111 H. 17, 137 P.3d 331 (2006).\n\nWhen the charged offense is theft by deception, as defined by paragraph (2), and the prosecution is relying on the tolling provision of §701-108(3)(a), relating to \"any offense an element of which is fraud\", the prosecution must not only allege the timely date or dates of commission of the offense in the indictment, but also the earliest date of the \"discovery of the offense by an aggrieved party or a person who has a legal duty to represent the aggrieved party\"; where indictment failed to aver the date of the earliest discovery of the alleged offenses, trial court order dismissing the indictment with prejudice affirmed. 111 H. 17, 137 P.3d 331 (2006).\n\nAppeals court did not err in concluding that theft of state property by deception under paragraph (2) constituted a continuing offense where petitioner acted \"under one general impulse\" and had \"but one intention and plan\" to unlawfully procure public assistance from the government through a \"series of acts\" all directed towards the same overarching goal; thus, a specific unanimity instruction for the jury under the Hawaii constitution, article I, § §5 and 14, was unnecessary. 122 H. 271, 226 P.3d 441 (2010).\n\nWhere appeals court correctly held that defendant's theft offense under subsection (1) and §708-830.5(1)(a) required proof of a value element which defendant's federal conspiracy offense did not, and was designed to prevent a substantially different harm--the deprivation of property rights versus the threat posed by agreements to commit criminal conduct, defendant's prosecution in state court was not barred under §701-112 and the circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss in this respect. 126 H. 205, 269 P.3d 740 (2011).\n\nWhere State presented evidence that \"a person of ordinary caution or prudence\" could \"believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion\" that the artifacts were the property of \"another\", including that the evidence was worth at least $800,000 and that the artifacts had been purposely secreted in the cave and not simply discarded, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's indictment, and the circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss. 126 H. 205, 269 P.3d 740 (2011).\n\nWhere petitioner was charged with theft by deception in a situation involving a contract, the intent element of the crime was not met where evidence showed that petitioner performed or intended to perform petitioner's part of the contract; intent element would have only been satisfied if the petitioner intended not to perform petitioner's contractual obligations; further, subsequent breach of the contract may give rise to potential civil remedies grounded in contract law, but unless accompanied by the intent to deprive a complainant's property, the breach does not create criminal liability for theft. 129 H. 414, 301 P.3d 1255 (2013).\n\nPhrase \"whether from the property or its proceeds or from [the person's] own property reserved in equivalent amount\" in paragraph (6)(a) limits application of paragraph to one of three situations specified in paragraph. 86 H. 183 (App.), 948 P.2d 604 (1997).\n\nThe law does not permit the conviction of a defendant of two counts of theft for, first, having obtained or taken an item of property and, second, for having disposed of or sold the same item of property; the taking and/or selling of one item of property is only one theft. 93 H. 22 (App.), 995 P.2d 323 (2000).\n\nWhere store security manager's testimony regarding the price/value of items, based on a universal price code with the price on the item that the manager verified through the store register system, was inadmissible hearsay, State failed to introduce substantial evidence of the value of the items necessary to support the charged offense of second or third degree theft; however, evidence was sufficient to support conviction of lesser included offense of fourth degree theft. 95 H. 169 (App.), 19 P.3d 752 (2001).\n\nTrial court erred harmfully in excluding, pursuant to HRE rules 401 and 403, defendant's exhibit with respect to defendant's theft-by-deception charges under paragraph (2), on the grounds that defendant's analysis of the tax laws was irrelevant and that evidence of defendant's legal theories would confuse the jury, where evidence that defendant, based on defendant's understanding of the tax laws, had a good faith belief that defendant did not owe taxes on defendant's wages was relevant to whether defendant acted by deception and whether defendant had a defense under §708-834(1). 119 H. 60 (App.), 193 P.3d 1260 (2008).",

The amendments implemented recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 5, Session Laws 2021, amended §708-831 to provide that the offense of theft in the second degree includes theft of property commonly used to store items of monetary value, including any purse, handbag, or wallet. The legislature found that the Penal Code did not adequately address situations in which an offender takes the property of another that is commonly used to store items of personal or monetary value, including purses, handbags, or wallets. Under existing law, the prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused offender intended to steal real property, such as a purse or wallet, valued in excess of $750 to convict a defendant of theft in the second degree. Commonly, purses and wallets are not valued at more than $750. However, these items often contain personal information of the victim as well as the victim's family, friends, and acquaintances; sensitive medical and financial information; workplace information; photos; and other personal items of sentimental value that may be irreplaceable. Therefore, theft of a purse or wallet can result in mental and emotional hardship beyond any loss of monetary value. The legislature further found that inclusion of the theft of purses, handbags, and wallets under the offense of theft in the second degree could deter potential offenders from committing these acts, thereby increasing public safety. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1205.\n\nAct 147, Session Laws 2021, amended §708-830.5 to provide that the offense of theft in the first degree includes theft of: (1) property from the person of another who is sixty years of age or older; or (2) property or services, the value of which exceeds $750, from a person who is sixty years of age or older; provided that in either case, the age of the property owner is known or reasonably should be known to the person who commits theft. Act 147 also amended §708-831 to provide that the offense of theft in the second degree includes theft of property or services, the value of which exceeds $250, from a person who is sixty years of age or older where the age of the property owner is known or reasonably should be known to the person who commits theft. The legislature found that the rate of crimes targeting seniors in the State had increased in recent years. The legislature further found that senior citizens are especially vulnerable to long-term physical, emotional, and financial harm from criminal acts and that there was a lack of adequate protection against exploitation of senior citizens under existing law. Act 147 more closely aligned certain Penal Code statutes with common elder abuse scenarios to facilitate appropriate responses by law enforcement and prosecutors. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1212.\n\nAct 52, Session Laws 2022, amended §708-831 to include theft of an electric gun, regardless of its monetary value, within the offense of theft in the second degree. The legislature found that the Penal Code did not adequately address the theft of electric guns, which became legal for members of the public on January 1, 2022. The legislature further found that criminals might seek out electric guns since these devices can cause severe pain and completely incapacitate a person and may be used to facilitate a multitude of crimes, including robberies, assaults, sexual assaults, human trafficking, and domestic abuse. The legislature noted that designating the theft of an electric gun, regardless of its value, as a higher degree of theft could have a long-term deterrent effect and create a safer environment for the community. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3303, House Standing Committee Report No. 779-22.\n\nAct 54, Session Laws 2022, amended §708-830.5 to specifically include theft of a motor vehicle or motorcycle in the offense of theft in the first degree. The legislature found that most motor vehicle thefts were previously prosecuted under the class C felonies of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle or theft in the second degree for property the value of which exceeds $750, with a maximum penalty of up to $10,000 and five years of imprisonment for either offense. The legislature further found that there was growing public support for increased penalties for motor vehicle theft to ensure that offenders receive an appropriate sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offense while providing adequate deterrence for future criminal activity. Accordingly, Act 54 elevated the offense of theft of a motor vehicle to a class B felony, with a maximum penalty of up to $25,000 and ten years of imprisonment. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3560, House Standing Committee Report No. 237-22.\n\nAttempt to commit theft, sufficiency of charge. 61 H. 177, 599 P.2d 285 (1979).\n\nJury instructions on the lesser included offenses of theft in the third degree under §708-832 and theft in the fourth degree under this section should have been given where jury could have found that petitioner committed theft of not only less than $20,000, but less than $300 or less than $100, making the offenses of theft III or theft IV applicable. 122 H. 271, 226 P.3d 441 (2010).\n\nAdequacy of evidence for conviction. 1 H.

Such consolidation is desirable both from the standpoint of conceptual simplicity and to eliminate pointless procedural obstacles.[1] Nonetheless, the numerous and diverse circumstances involved in individual theft offenses require that the general offense be differentiated by degrees and that the severity of the penalties authorized be correlated with the aggravating circumstances presented by the form and object of the offense. Accordingly, §708-830 provides that a person commits theft if the person engages in any of the modes of conduct specified therein, and § §708-831 through 833 divide theft into three degrees differentiated by the mode of the conduct involved and the object of the theft.\n\nIt should be noted that in all theft offenses, the requisite mental state is intent to deprive the owner of the value of property or services. Although in most instances the actor will intend to appropriate the value of property or services for the actor's own benefit, that is not the gravamen of the offense.\n\nObtaining or exerting unauthorized control.Section 708-830(1) is concerned with obtaining or exerting control over the property of another with intent to deprive the other of the property. A wide range of behavior is included within this definition, from stealthily and covertly treating the property of another as one's own to blatantly snatching it from the person of the owner. This definition contains elements of the traditional offenses of larceny, embezzlement, and fraudulent conversion. And, unlike the case with traditional embezzlement statutes, the relation in which the actor stands to the victim is immaterial. Likewise, there are no limitations with regard to the trust involved in fraudulent conversion: the coverage includes property held by the actor in any capacity. All kinds of property, both real and personal, movable and immovable, are included within this definition.[2] The definition of the phrase \"property of another\" has previously been discussed in relation to the criminal property damage offenses of part III, and is intended to cover situations in which the actor has an interest in the property involved.[3] \"Obtain\" is broadly defined to mean, when used in relation to property, \"to bring about a transfer of possession or other interest, whether to the obtainer or to another.[4] \"Control over the property\" is also broadly defined and means any exercise of dominion, including taking, possession, and sale.[5]\n\nDeception.Section 708-830(2) covers the same kind of deprivation to a property owner as that covered in subsection (1), except that the deprivation here proscribed is accomplished by deception. Indeed, the obtaining or exerting of control may be accomplished with the owner's specific authorization. \"Deception\" includes any false impression for which the actor is responsible by either act or omission: a detailed definition of the term is provided by §708-800. With regard to contractual obligations, a present intent not to perform would constitute deception, although mere breach at some future time, without such present intent, would not. A specific exception is provided in the definition for matters having no pecuniary significance and for advertising claims unlikely to deceive ordinary persons.\n\nExtortion.Section 708-830(3) covers theft by threat, i.e., extortion. \"Extortion\" is defined in §708-800 in some detail. This mode of theft includes some aspects of separate offenses formerly designated as extortion and blackmail. Under the Code, the threat may be either express or implied. The threat need not be to do something itself unlawful: it is the context which renders the conduct unlawful. However, not all threats made to obtain property are included. As the commentary to the Model Penal Code observes:\n\nA law which included all threats made for the purpose of obtaining property would embrace a large portion of accepted economic bargaining. Examples of menaces which ought not to be included are: to breach a contract, to persuade others to breach their contracts, to infringe a patent or trademark, to change a will, to refuse to do business or to cease doing business, to sue, to vote stock one way or another. For the most part these are situations in which a private property economy must tolerate considerable 'economic coercion' as an incident to free bargaining. Civil remedies are usually adequate to deal with the abuse of the privileges. Some coercive economic bargaining may call for legal restriction by anti-trust laws, labor legislation and the like; but theft penalties would be quite inappropriate.[6]\n\nAppropriation.Section 708-830(4) covers property over which the actor has gained control either by chance or through mistake on the part of some other person. The actor must know the property to be lost, mislaid, or mistakenly delivered. It is essential here that there be some control over, and not merely knowledge of the existence or location of, the property concerned. The requisite state of mind, intent, requires that the failure to take measures to restore the property be intentional, so that a negligent or even reckless failure in this regard would not suffice to establish liability. What measures are considered sufficient (i.e., reasonable) toward restoring the property are to be established from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor's circumstances. It should be noted that, unlike the common-law offense of larceny, the actor's state of mind at the moment of finding the property is not conclusive to a determination of theft under subsection (4). The actor may, at the time of finding, intend to restore the property to its owner, subsequently decide not to, continue to exert control over the property, and thus be guilty of theft.\n\nObtaining services by deception or extortion.Section 708-830(5) covers theft of services, rather than property, under circumstances similar to those specified in §708-830(1) to (3). To begin with, the actor must know that the services are available only for compensation rather than gratuitously. In order to preclude spurious defenses based on a claim of intent to pay for services at a later date, a special rule of prima facie evidence is provided where payment is usually made upon receipt of service. Where compensation for services is ordinarily paid immediately upon the rendering of them, such as in the case of hotels, restaurants, and the like, absconding without payment or offer to pay is prima facie evidence that the services were obtained by deception, i.e., obtained with intent not to pay for them. The evidentiary rule is not difficult to overcome where the accused has any evidence to the contrary, but merely allows the prosecutor to get the prosecutor's case to the jury on an issue where direct proof is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain.\n\nDiversion of services.Subsection (6) covers those cases in which the actor has authorized control over the services of another to which the actor is not entitled, and the actor diverts those services to a person not entitled thereto. This subsection would, for instance, cover the diversion of utility services by an employee of a utility company.\n\nFailure to make required disposition of funds.Section 708-830(7)(a) makes it theft to obtain property from anyone upon an agreement or legal obligation to make a specified payment or disposition and then to deal with the property, its proceeds, or a reserve fund from which payment was to be made, as the actor's own and to fail to make the required disposition. It is not necessary, under the Code, to identify the particular property, proceeds, or funds which the accused has appropriated and which the accused has in the accused's possession: this avoids the common-law necessity of proof of the victim's continued constructive possession. Courts have had difficulty in regarding this type of wrongful appropriation as theft because it arises out of a breach of a civil contractual obligation. The evidentiary rule, provided in this subsection, that financial institutions and government officers and employees are, prima facie, aware of their legal obligations to make certain payments and distributions is a statutory crystallization of common experience. Concomitantly, failure to pay or account upon lawful demand, or falsification of accounts, is, prima facie, evidence that the officer or employee has intentionally dealt with the property as the officer's or the employee's own. The burden of proving guilt is not affected; the evidentiary rule merely allows the prosecution to take the point to the jury.\n\nSubsection (7)(b) is aimed at the same failure to make an agreed upon or legally required disposition of funds following receipt of personal services from an employee.\n\nReceiving stolen property.Subsection (8) is based upon the premise that if the prosecution can demonstrate the requisite intent to deprive the owner of the owner's property, it makes little difference whether the defendant engaged in theft directly (e.g., obtained the property directly from the owner) or did so indirectly through the mediation of another person. It should be sufficient to constitute a form of theft that the actor knows that the property was stolen when the actor has control over it and that the actor intends to deprive the owner of its value. The actor may accomplish the actor's intent through receipt, retention, or disposal, all of which are acts consistent with an intent to deprive. If the actor is a dealer in the type of property received, the fact that the actor acquired the property for grossly inadequate consideration is made prima facie evidence that the actor knew of the previous theft.\n\nDegrees of theft.The Code is in accord with the Model Penal Code and other recent revisions in grading the theft offenses according to the mode of the theft, the object involved, and the value of the property or services stolen.[7] The gradation is based on the theory that theft from the person, or of a firearm, or of property or services of relatively high value presents greater social harm and that the actor in such cases may require greater rehabilitation efforts. Moreover, the ordinary person, insofar as value of the property or services is concerned, \"feels a lesser repugnance to taking small amounts than large amounts.\"[8] Accordingly, the general offense has been divided into three degrees, according to the aggravations of the circumstances of the theft. With respect to value, $200 constitutes the lower limit for class C felony liability, $50 for misdemeanor liability, and any value suffices for petty misdemeanor liability.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law exhibited the profusion of theft statutes which is symptomatic of statutory enactment of the piecemeal common-law development. The consolidated theft offenses, presented by these sections, are to be preferred to the scattered coverage of the prior law. The type of conduct dealt with under the consolidated theft offenses was found in previous chapters dealing with taxes,[9] banks,[10] insurance,[11] embezzlement,[12] extortion,[13] fraudulent conveyances,[14] gross cheat,[15] larceny,[16] and receiving stolen goods.[17] An examination of those chapters, each containing numerous sections, will indicate that within certain chapters the sections were not internally consistent and that as between the chapters the provisions were not comparatively consistent.\n\nIn addition to eliminating the sheer bulk and redundancy of statutory provisions dealing with various forms of theft, the Code attempts to bring together for related treatment similar forms of conduct and to eliminate areas of possible inconsistency.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §708-830 TO 708-833\n\nAct 102, Session Laws 1972, amended §708-831 by adding paragraph (d). It should also be noted that when the legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it changed the Proposed Draft's recommended value amount from $500 to $200. The legislature stated:\n\nYour Committee has agreed to decrease the minimum dollar amount of first degree theft from $500 to $200 because the $500 figure is unwarranted, especially in light of the present law relating to larceny and to cover shoplifting and cattle rustling. Conference Committee Report No. 2.\n\nAct 39, Session Laws 1974, amended §708-830 by adding paragraph (9). The new paragraph (9) covers a wide variety of circumstances involved in the practice of shoplifting. The legislature was concerned with the difficulties involved in the apprehension of shoplifters. House Standing Committee Report No. 651-74, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 848-74.\n\nAct 201, Session Laws 1974, amended § §708-831 and 708-832, relating to theft in the first degree and in the second degree respectively. The amendments provided that in the case of extortion, the penalty for theft in the first degree is a class B felony, and the penalty for theft in the second degree is a class C felony. The legislature felt that the nature of the crime of extortion and the fact that it seems to be one of the principal activities of organized crime, justify stiffer penalties for cases of theft involving extortion. House Standing Committee Report No. 420-74.\n\nAct 242, Session Laws 1974, amended §708-832(1). The amendment provided that the siphoning or taking of gasoline diesel fuel or other petroleum products used as propellants constituted theft in the second degree. The legislature provided for a value limit of $200.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee in Standing Committee Report No. 972-74 declared:\n\nYour Committee feels the serious situation in the community relates to all fuel and not just gasoline.... Your Committee wishes to further note that theft of more than $200 of gasoline and other related petroleum products will carry a maximum penalty of 5 years in jail and a $5,000 fine.\n\nAct 158, Session Laws 1975, amended §708-831 by adding paragraph (e) to subsection (1). The intent of the amendment was to aid ranchers in proceeding against individuals who slaughter livestock upon their land by making such an act theft in the first degree. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 825, House Standing Committee Report No. 423.\n\nAct 106, Session Laws 1979, amended § §708-830, 708-831, and 708-832 as part of a consolidation of laws pertaining to extortion.\n\nAct 68, Session Laws 1981, broadened the coverage of §708-831(e). The subsection formerly made it an offense for a person to possess carcasses or meat while on fenced or enclosed premises but did not extend to situations where a person possessed live animals, or carcasses or meat in other locations.\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, amended § §708-831 to 708-833 by increasing the dollar amount of the property involved in the theft offenses. The previous figures were designated in 1972 when the Code was first codified. With the increase, the dollar amount will more accurately reflect current property values and consequently the offenses will warrant the level of culpability intended when the offenses were originally drafted. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 820-86.\n\nAct 54, Session Laws 1992, amended §708-831 by providing for the offense of theft in the second degree of an aquaculture product from fenced or enclosed premises to deter pilfering, since thefts from aquaculture farms may cause devastating losses to research facilities and businesses. House Standing Committee Report No. 1184-92, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1671.\n\nAct 289, Session Laws 1992, amended § §708-830.5 and 708-831 by upgrading the offense of theft of a firearm, dynamite, or other explosive from a class C to a class B felony. The legislature felt that the serious and hazardous nature of firearm thefts and thefts of dynamite and other explosives justified the upgrade in the penalty and classification. Conference Committee Report No. 52.\n\nAct 14, Session Laws 1993, amended §708-830.5 by providing that theft in the first degree includes theft of services in which the value exceeds $20,000. The legislature found that this amendment was necessary to restore legislative intent and provide consistency within the penal code, in particular with §708-831, as amended by Act 314, Session Laws 1986. House Standing Committee Report No. 186, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1065.\n\nAct 218, Session Laws 1993, amended §708-831 to provide that persons who commit the theft of agricultural equipment, supplies, or products, under certain conditions, shall be subject to a class C felony. The legislature sought to discourage the theft of agricultural equipment, supplies, or products, finding that many agricultural enterprises in the State are isolated and subject to theft, and that losses from the island of Hawaii alone exceed $200,000 per year. Conference Committee Report No. 52.\n\nAct 228, Session Laws 1998, amended §708-831 by making the offense of theft in the second degree of an aquaculture product or of agricultural equipment, supplies, or products subject to the requirement that the theft occur on: (a) premises that are fenced, enclosed, or secured in a manner designed to exclude intruders; or (b) premises upon which there is displayed the signage, \"Private Property.\" The legislature realized that the costs incurred under current signage requirements pursuant to §708-831 were onerous and believed that Act 228 would reduce unnecessary costs to farmers and ranchers. Conference Committee Report No. 145.\n\nAct 87, Session Laws 2001, amended §708-830 to allow photocopies of unaltered price or name tags, or other markings on goods or merchandise and printed register receipts as prima facie evidence regarding value and ownership in theft cases. The legislature found that expanding §708-830(8) to include photocopies of the price tags or price markings was in conformity with rule 1003, Hawaii rules of evidence, which permits the admissibility of duplicate copies to the same extent as an original unless a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or under circumstances that it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original. The legislature also found that the statutory requirement for proof of value in theft cases had not kept pace with the technology of recordkeeping of merchandise stock prices. With proper evidentiary foundation, photocopies of price tags and printed register receipts are reliable evidence of value. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 714, House Standing Committee Report No. 1519.\n\nAct 182, Session Laws 2005, amended §708-831 by providing that a person commits theft in the second degree if the person commits theft of agricultural equipment, supplies, or products, valued from over $100 and up to and including $20,000, or of agricultural products that exceed 25 pounds, from premises that are fenced, enclosed, or secured in a manner designed to exclude intruders, or there is prominently displayed on the premises a sign that provides sufficient notice and reads \"Private Property.\" The section was also amended to provide that possession of agricultural products without ownership and movement certificates is prima facie evidence that the products are or have been stolen. Act 182 addressed the problem of agricultural theft in Hawaii by amending various provisions of Hawaii's theft laws relating to agricultural livestock and products. Conference Committee Report No. 77, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1359.\n\nAct 116, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-830.5, expanding the offense of theft in the first degree to include theft of property or services of more than $300, during a civil defense emergency proclaimed by the governor or during a period of disaster relief. Act 116 penalized the commission of certain crimes during a time of a civil defense emergency proclaimed by the governor or during a period of disaster relief. The legislature found that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita created situations that highlighted the prevalence of opportunistic crimes that can occur during these times. When resources are needed to restore law and order, emergency response aid to victims may be hampered or delayed, leaving victims at an increased risk of bodily injury or death. Stronger measures to control law and order may deter looting and other crimes. Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 2938 and 3302, House Standing Committee Report No. 757-06, Conference Committee Report No. 64-06.\n\nAct 156, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-831 by replacing the word \"aquaculture\" with \"aquacultural\" in the phrase \"aquaculture product\" as a conforming amendment.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-830 by adding the word \"unauthorized\" in paragraph (1) and by making other technical nonsubstantive amendments.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-832(1) by providing that theft of gasoline or related petroleum products valued at $300, formerly $200, constitutes theft in the third degree. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 125, Session Laws 2012, amended §708-831(1) by: (1) making theft of agricultural commodities generally known to be marketed for commercial purposes an offense of theft in the second degree; (2) defining agricultural commodities; (3) specifying the contents of signs to give sufficient notice to exclude intruders from a fenced or enclosed premise containing an aquacultural product or agricultural equipment, supplies, or products; and (4) including theft of agricultural equipment, supplies, or products under the offense of theft in the second degree if, at the point of entry of the premise, a crop is visible. The legislature found that agricultural theft continues to be a significant problem in the State and has resulted in millions of dollars in losses for the agricultural industry. The legislature further found that existing laws were not stringent enough to deter potential thieves. Act 125 would allow prosecutors to develop stronger cases against thieves of agricultural products and commodities. Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 2289 and 3322.\n\nAct 111, Session Laws 2014, which amended §708-830.5(1), updated and recodified Hawaii's emergency management laws to conform with nationwide emergency management practices by, among other things, establishing a Hawaii emergency management agency in the state department of defense with the functions and authority currently held by the state civil defense agency; establishing the power and authority of the director of Hawaii emergency management, who will be the adjutant general, and providing the director with the functions and authority currently held by the director of civil defense; establishing county emergency management agencies, each to be under the respective county mayor's direction, with the functions and authority currently held by the local organizations for civil defense; and repealing the chapters on disaster relief [chapter 127] and the civil defense [and] emergency act chapter 128, which were determined to be obsolete with the creation of the Hawaii emergency management agency.

      "text": "§708-834 Defenses: unawareness of ownership; claim of right; household belongings; co-interest not a defense.(1) It is a defense to a prosecution for theft that the defendant:\n\n(a) Was unaware that the property or service was that of another; or\n\n(b) Believed that the defendant was entitled to the property or services under a claim of right or that the defendant was authorized, by the owner or by law, to obtain or exert control as the defendant did.\n\n(2) If the owner of the property is the defendant's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, it is a defense to a prosecution for theft of property that:\n\n(a) The property which is obtained or over which unauthorized control is exerted constitutes household belongings; and\n\n(b) The defendant and the defendant's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary were living together at the time of the conduct.\n\n(3) \"Household belongings\" means furniture, personal effects, vehicles, money or its equivalent in amounts customarily used for household purposes, and other property usually found in and about the common dwelling and accessible to its occupants.\n\n(4) In a prosecution for theft, it is not a defense that the defendant has an interest in the property if the owner has an interest in the property to which the defendant is not entitled. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1979, c 106, §8; am L 1980, c 232, §41; gen ch 1993; am L 1997, c 383, §69]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §708-834\n\nBoth the defenses allowed under §708-834(1) are probably unnecessary in light of an informed reading of the substantive definitions of the various modes of theft. The existence of either condition (a) or (b) would relieve the actor of the culpability required to establish the offense: the actor could not have intended to deprive another of property (or refuse payment for services) unless the actor was aware that the property or services were that of another; and a claim of right, assuming that it amounts to a belief that the actor is the true owner, would not only indicate that the actor did not have the requisite mental state, it would constitute a mistake of fact defense under §702-218. The summary and restatement of this subsection is principally for purposes of clarity and emphasis.\n\nThe marital defense of subsection (2) is based upon various theories. First, the uncertainty of ownership of much household property, together with the potential bitterness of interspousal conflict, provide numerous opportunities for a miscarriage of justice.[1] Alternatively, it is said that household belongings, defined in subsection (3), constitute a kind of \"common pool of wealth,\" and that misappropriations in this context are so generally tolerated as not to deviate substantially from socially-accepted norms. A wife who rifles her husband's wallet, or a husband who pawns his wife's jewelry, does not present a grave danger to the community, so long as the activity is so confined. Finally, criminal courts are unsuited to handle breakdowns in the family structure of which interspousal theft complaints are only a symptom.[2]\n\nSubsection (4) is intended to cover the situation where an aggrieved person attempts to seek an informal solution by threatening legal action unless restitution, indemnification, or compensation is made. The most significant instance of this device is the waiver of prosecution commonly offered by insurance companies in exchange for the return of valuable merchandise. The rationale here is that it is hardly fair to penalize someone for trying to recover one's own goods (or the value thereof), nor could the penal law realistically expect to suppress such natural inclinations.\n\nSubsection (5) merely requires that the interest which the actor asserts under a claim of right must be inconsistent with that of the victim. The premise is that if the interest is not inconsistent, it does not justify the actor's possession as opposed to that of the victim. Furthermore, it is felt that \"co- owners should be as well protected against the depredations of other co-owners as they are against outsiders.\"3\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-834\n\nAct 106, Session Laws 1979, amended this section as part of a consolidation of laws pertaining to extortion.\n\nAct 232, Session Laws 1980, added subsection (4) and the words \"co-interest not a defense\" in the section heading to restore language erroneously omitted by L 1979, Act 107, §8.\n\nAct 383, Session Laws 1997, amended this section to provide a defense to prosecution for theft of property to reciprocal beneficiaries. In establishing the status of reciprocal beneficiaries, the Act provides certain rights and benefits and represents a commitment to provide substantially similar government rights to those couples who are barred by law from marriage. Conference Committee Report No. 2.\n\nClaim of right defense discussed. 62 H. 25, 608 P.2d 855 (1980).\n\nClaim of right defense to theft under this section does not apply in a prosecution for robbery. 83 H. 264, 925 P.2d 1088 (1996).\n\nAppeals court erred in concluding that petitioner adduced sufficient evidence to warrant instruction on a claim-of-right defense where petitioner's theory of defense warranted a general mistake of fact instruction; a claim-of-right defense must encompass some form of pre-existing ownership or possession of specific property, and petitioner's claim of entitlement to welfare benefits was not one of \"true ownership\" in \"specific personal property\", but merely a belief in entitlement to some undefined future benefit that was never in petitioner's possession at any point prior to the alleged theft. 122 H. 271, 226 P.3d 441 (2010).\n\nSubsection (1)(b)'s defense was not applicable to offense of unauthorized control of propelled vehicle ( §708-836). 10 H. App. 200, 862 P.2d 1073 (1993).\n\nTrial court erred harmfully in excluding, pursuant to HRE rules 401 and 403, defendant's exhibit with respect to defendant's theft-by-deception charges under §708-830(2), on the grounds that defendant's analysis of the tax laws was irrelevant and that evidence of defendant's legal theories would confuse the jury, where evidence that defendant, based on defendant's understanding of the tax laws, had a good faith belief that defendant did not owe taxes on defendant's wages was relevant to whether defendant acted by deception and whether defendant had a defense under subsection (1). 119 H. 60 (App.), 193 P.3d 1260 (2008).\n\n§708-834 Commentary:\n\n1.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §708-835\n\nAs outlined in the commentary on §708-830, one of the principal reasons for the consolidation of various related common-law and statutory offenses under the single theft statute is to eliminate pointless procedural obstacles in prosecution. The possibility of quashing a theft indictment because of variance would substantially pervert the virtue of simplicity which such consolidation seeks to achieve. Subject only to the court's power to ensure a fair trial (e.g., to ensure that the accused has adequate time and information to prepare a defense), any charge of theft may be proved by demonstration, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused's actions came within the definition of one of the subsections of §708-830.1\n\nThe law does not permit the conviction of a defendant of two counts of theft for, first, having obtained or taken an item of property and, second, for having disposed of or sold the same item of property; the taking and/or selling of one item of property is only one theft. 93 H. 22 (App.), 995 P.2d 323 (2000).\n\n§708-835 Commentary:\n\n1.

See Supplemental Commentary on §708-836. The Commentary below was based on the original version in the Proposed Draft.]\n\nThis section is intended to deal with the special case of \"joy riding,\" where the vehicle is returned in undamaged condition, and the temporary borrowing is just for the pleasure (or convenience) of operating the vehicle. The offense is a relatively mild one, and, as it is generally committed by youngsters, the penalty is set at the misdemeanor level. Note that the unauthorized control over the vehicle must be operation of the vehicle: the use of the vehicle as a shelter, for example, ought not to come within the prohibition of this section.[1] The prevalence of \"joy riding\" predominantly relates to motor-propelled vehicles, and the Code limits this special offense of misappropriation to such property. The misdemeanor sanction is felt too severe to apply to other forms of unauthorized use of personal property unless other aggravating attendant circumstances are present.\n\nThe affirmative defense allowed under subsection (3) is felt necessary to \"exempt from criminal liability a good deal of informal borrowing of automobiles by members of the same household or friends of the owner.\"[2]\n\nPreviously Hawaii had no statute dealing specifically with the problem of unauthorized use of a propelled vehicle. Instead, such cases were prosecuted as the offense of \"malicious conversion\"3 which covered any unauthorized moving, taking, carrying away, or converting, no matter how temporary. The offense was punishable by a possible fine of $1000 or term of imprisonment of five years or both. The distinction provided by this part, and the reduction proposed in this section, represent needed changes in Hawaii law.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-836\n\nAct 38, Session Laws 1974, amended this section to refer to the unauthorized \"control,\" rather than unauthorized \"operation\" of a propelled vehicle. The penalty for the offense was raised from a misdemeanor to a class C felony, and the offense was broadened to include the situation where a change in the identity of the vehicle is made without the owner's consent.\n\nAct 195, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by amending the definition of \"owner,\" for purposes of this section, and by amending the affirmative defense, to provide an affirmative defense to a person who had authorization to use the vehicle from an agent of the owner and to a lien holder or legal owner of the propelled vehicle, or authorized agent, engaged in lawful repossession of the propelled vehicle. The legislature found that the current affirmative defense, together with the current definition of \"owner\" (in §708-800) as a person having possession of the vehicle even when the possession is unlawful, provided an unintended loophole for defendants, who could avoid conviction by alleging that a \"friend\" loaned the vehicle to the defendants. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1659, Conference Committee Report No. 61.\n\nAct 11, Session Laws 1999, amended this section by amending the state of mind required for the offense of unauthorized control of propelled vehicle to include a knowing state of mind. The legislature found that in the prosecution of a charge of unauthorized control of propelled vehicle the State must prove that the defendant intentionally exerted unauthorized control over the vehicle. Consequently, the State may be unable to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt when the defendant claims that the defendant thought the defendant had permission from another person whom the defendant believed to be the owner or the agent of the automobile owner. The inclusion of the \"knowing\" state of mind to the offense would address this problem. House Standing Committee Report No. 1459.\n\nAct 87, Session Laws 2001, established the legal owner as the owner of a vehicle that has no registered owner under this section. The legislature found that there was a gap in the definition of \"owner\" in the offense of unauthorized control of propelled vehicle. Current law limited \"owner\" to the registered owner or unrecorded owner pending transfer. The amendments to the definition of \"owner\" were necessary to cover propelled vehicles that are not required to be registered, such as golf carts or construction equipment. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 714, House Standing Committee Report No. 1519.\n\nAct 6, Session Laws 2021, amended this section to reclassify as a first degree offense the existing offense of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle in conjunction with the establishment of the offense of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle in the second degree under §708-836.1. The legislature found that there were a number of statutory provisions enacted to address the high number of vehicle thefts in the State, especially on the island of Oahu. Frequently, a stolen vehicle is recovered during the commission of a crime or after it has been used to commit other crimes. The legislature found that court rulings on prior law aimed at punishing or deterring the theft of propelled vehicles required the prosecution to prove that a defendant knew the propelled vehicle was stolen. This could be difficult to prove and had hindered efforts to prosecute persons operating stolen vehicles. The legislature further found that Act 6 would provide law enforcement with the flexibility to prosecute persons who recklessly or negligently exert unauthorized control of another's propelled vehicle by operating the vehicle without the owner's consent or by changing the identity of the vehicle without the owner's consent. House Standing Committee Report No. 765, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1206.\n\nAct 53, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to create an affirmative defense for anyone charged with unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle, where the defendant purchased the vehicle and reasonably believed themselves to be the actual owner of the vehicle. The legislature found that in cases involving unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle, the prosecution is often blindsided at trial when a defendant makes an inference during questioning of a witness, or personally testifies, that the defendant purchased the vehicle. When this occurs, the trial has already commenced and the prosecution is learning of this defense for the first time. At that point, the prosecution and police are unable to investigate these claims mid-trial, jeopardy has already been attached, and jurors are potentially left to question whether the State has in fact proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The legislature noted that if a defendant has in fact purchased the vehicle, that information should be relayed to the prosecution for proper investigation to ensure that the defendant is not wrongfully prosecuted and resources are not wasted. Accordingly, Act 53 codified an affirmative defense for these types of cases to place the burden on the defendant to prove the particular defense by a preponderance of the evidence while still requiring the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3408, House Standing Committee Report No. 780-22.\n\nSection covers defendant's unauthorized use of truck for defendant's convenience; evidence sufficient to sustain conviction. 789 F.2d 1364 (1986).\n\nOfficer had probable cause to believe defendant was an accomplice where: (1) car's license plate and \"punched\" ignition were located in such places that would suggest defendant knew vehicle was stolen; and (2) defendant and car driver were parked at a house whose owner knew defendant but not the driver, suggesting that defendant assisted in the decision to park at the house, thereby aiding or attempting to aid driver's commission of an unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle (UCPV) violation; thus evidence was sufficient to provide more than a mere suspicion that defendant committed the offense of UCPV either as a principal or accomplice. 109 H. 84, 123 P.3d 679 (2005).\n\nBecause this section does not \"plainly appear\" to render its specified state of mind inapplicable to the authorization element, the intentional or knowing states of mind apply to the authorization element; thus, a defendant prosecuted under this section may assert the mistake-of-fact defense under §702-218 with respect to the authorization element, where defendant claims that defendant mistakenly believed that the person who authorized defendant's operation of the vehicle was the vehicle's registered owner, because such a belief would potentially negative the state of mind required to establish the authorization element of the offense. 117 H. 235, 178 P.3d 1 (2008).\n\nSection 708-834(1)(b)'s defense was not applicable to offense. 10 H. App. 200, 862 P.2d 1073 (1993).\n\nSection only requires proof that the defendant's intentional conduct was to accomplish at least one of two objectives, that is, to operate the vehicle or to change the identity of the vehicle without having obtained the owner's consent in either event. 93 H. 344 (App.), 3 P.3d 510 (2000).\n\nUnder this section, proving that a person operated another's propelled vehicle without the owner's consent also necessarily establishes that the person \"exerted unauthorized control\" over the vehicle. 110 H. 386 (App.), 133 P.3d 815 (2006).\n\nThere was substantial evidence to convict defendant under this section where truck owner testified that owner called police to report truck missing and that owner had not given anyone permission to drive it, did not know, nor give permission to defendant to drive it, arresting officer testified that after officer stopped truck, check on patrol car's computer indicated that truck was stolen, and witness testified that witness saw defendant drive truck earlier that day. 112 H. 192 (App.), 145 P.3d 735 (2006).\n\nThere was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle under this section where defendant testified that defendant drove the van, and victim testified that the van belonged to victim and victim had not given defendant permission to drive the van. 123 H. 456 (App.), 235 P.3d 1168 (2010).\n\nCited: State v.

[L 2021, c 6, §2; am L 2022, c 53, §3]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §708-836.1\n\nAct 6, Session Laws 2021, added this section to establish the offense of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle in the second degree. The legislature found that there were a number of statutory provisions enacted to address the high number of vehicle thefts in the State, especially on the island of Oahu. Frequently, a stolen vehicle is recovered during the commission of a crime or after it has been used to commit other crimes. The legislature found that court rulings on prior law aimed at punishing or deterring the theft of propelled vehicles required the prosecution to prove that a defendant knew the propelled vehicle was stolen. This could be difficult to prove and had hindered efforts to prosecute persons operating stolen vehicles. The legislature further found that Act 6 would provide law enforcement with the flexibility to prosecute persons who recklessly or negligently exert unauthorized control of another's propelled vehicle by operating the vehicle without the owner's consent or by changing the identity of the vehicle without the owner's consent. House Standing Committee Report No. 765, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1206.\n\nAct 53, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to create an affirmative defense for anyone charged with unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle, where the defendant purchased the vehicle and reasonably believed themselves to be the actual owner of the vehicle. The legislature found that in cases involving unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle, the prosecution is often blindsided at trial when a defendant makes an inference during questioning of a witness, or personally testifies, that the defendant purchased the vehicle. When this occurs, the trial has already commenced and the prosecution is learning of this defense for the first time. At that point, the prosecution and police are unable to investigate these claims mid-trial, jeopardy has already been attached, and jurors are potentially left to question whether the State has in fact proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The legislature noted that if a defendant has in fact purchased the vehicle, that information should be relayed to the prosecution for proper investigation to ensure that the defendant is not wrongfully prosecuted and resources are not wasted. Accordingly, Act 53 codified an affirmative defense for these types of cases to place the burden on the defendant to prove the particular defense by a preponderance of the evidence while still requiring the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The legislature found that catalytic converter thefts were on the rise across the State. Catalytic converters contain precious metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium, the prices of which had recently increased, making catalytic converters highly sought after by thieves due to their high resale value. The relative ease and speed in which a person could remove a catalytic converter from a vehicle, coupled with the value of the scrap and precious metal, had contributed to the increase in catalytic converter thefts. While catalytic converters could typically be resold on the market for less than a few hundred dollars, replacing a stolen catalytic converter could cost a car owner more than $1,000 or perhaps more depending on the extent of damages. The legislature noted that Act 88 established the offense of theft of a catalytic converter as a class C felony, thereby removing any burdensome requirement of proving a defendant had knowledge of the value of the property.

These marks are removed to frustrate the police and so that the thieves can resell the items. The resale of untraceable firearms is a practice which directly contributes to violent crimes in the community.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §708-838 AND 708-839\n\nAct 27, Session Laws 1977, amended these sections to provide for two classes of identification marks--those placed by manufacturers and those affixed by others--and to differentiate the mental aspect required for the imposition of liability as to each class.

But for altering other marks, it requires acting \"knowingly, to conceal the true ownership of the property of another.\" Similarly §708-839, as now amended, intends to impose liability for the mere possession of the merchandise where merchandise with altered manufacturer's marks are involved, but to require possession with knowledge of the alteration where other marks are concerned.

[L 2022, c 112, §2]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §708-839.9\n\nAct 112, Session Laws 2022, added this section to establish the offense of theft of mail. The legislature found that the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic had changed the way many families relied on delivery services. There had been a major increase in the amount of online orders being placed and subsequently fulfilled by shipping items through the mail. Most packages sent through the mail are left outside the door at their intended destination if there is no mail receptacle large enough for the package on site. The legislature further found that reports of mail theft were on the rise. When mail carriers leave packages by doors or in otherwise unsecured mail receptacles, the packages are susceptible to theft, leading to frustration for senders and intended recipients. The legislature noted that Act 112 provided necessary protection to the property of the State's residents and facilitated the prosecution of theft of mail at the state level.

It is significant to note, however, that the theft acts as an incentive to the threatened use of force. Thus the combination of these two criminal activities has a multiplicative, rather than a simple additive effect. This increased risk of harm is one reason why robbery is treated as a separate offense and more severely penalized than the sum of its simple components would seem to indicate.[1] Another reason which has been advanced for the separate treatment of robbery is that the average citizen feels a special degree of affront at the prospect of having his possessions taken through the threat or use of force.[2] In a slightly different vein, it has also been suggested that such an offender \"exhibits himself as seriously deviated from community norms, requiring more extensive incapacitation and retraining.\"[3]\n\nWhen the legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it consolidated the Proposed Draft's three degrees of robbery into two degrees. The simple threat or use of force or the reckless infliction of serious bodily injury in the commission of a theft constitutes robbery in the second degree and carries a class B felony sanction. Where the person committing the above acts is armed with a dangerous instrument, or intentionally inflicts serious bodily harm, or attempts to kill, the offense is increased to the first degree and its sanction to a class A felony.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law also recognized two degrees of robbery. Robbery was defined as the \"stealing of a thing from the person of another or from his custody or presence, by force or putting him in fear.\"[4] Robbery in the first degree was robbery by one armed with a dangerous weapon who injured another in committing the robbery or who, if resisted, intended to kill or injure another.[5] All other robbery was second degree robbery.[6] Thus, the Code's definitions of the offenses are substantively similar to those of prior Hawaii law; however, the Code's definitions are more inclusive than prior law and are linguistically correlated with the theft offenses.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §708-840 AND 708-841\n\nAct 68, Session Laws 1983, amended § §708-840 and 708-841 so that a person could be charged with robbery if that person, in committing theft, used force intended to overcome any person's resistance. This amendment was believed necessary because often a property owner is not present when force is used to take that owner's property. In that case, under prior law the person forcibly taking the property could not have been charged with robbery. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 788.\n\nAct 68, Session Laws 1998, amended §708-840 by including in the offense of robbery in the first degree, situations where a person knowingly inflicts or attempts to inflict serious bodily injury on another in the course of committing a theft. The legislature believed that since robbery was essentially an assault committed during the course of a theft, the statutory scheme involving the highest degree of robbery, robbery in the first degree, should be consistent with that of the assault statutes, and thus, robbery in the first degree should include both the intentional and knowing states of mind. Act 68 made the offense of robbery in the first degree consistent with the offense of assault in the first degree. House Standing Committee Report No. 1231-98.\n\nAct 116, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-840, expanding the offense of robbery in the first degree to include using force to commit a theft or threatening imminent use of force against a person during a time of civil defense emergency or during a period of disaster relief. Act 116 penalized the commission of certain crimes during a time of a civil defense emergency proclaimed by the governor or during a period of disaster relief. The legislature found that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita created situations that highlighted the prevalence of opportunistic crimes that can occur during these times. When resources are needed to restore law and order, emergency response aid to victims may be hampered or delayed, leaving victims at an increased risk of bodily injury or death. Stronger measures to control law and order may deter looting and other crimes. Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 2938 and 3302, Conference Committee Report No. 64-06.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended § §708-840(1) and 708-841(1) by establishing motor vehicle theft as part of the offenses of robbery in the first and second degrees, respectively. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 255, Session Laws 2013, amended §708-840(1) and (2) to include the use of a simulated firearm in the offense of robbery in the first degree. The legislature found that simulated firearms are becoming increasingly difficult to discern from real firearms and as a result, simulated firearms are being used to commit serious criminal offenses. The victims in these crimes believe that the weapons are real and are terrorized when threatened with one. Under existing law, if the weapon is not a real firearm, the suspect cannot be charged with the higher offense of robbery in the first degree and the charge is reduced to a misdemeanor. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 488, House Standing Committee Report No. 1231.\n\nAct 111, Session Laws 2014, which amended §708-840(1), updated and recodified Hawaii's emergency management laws to conform with nationwide emergency management practices by, among other things, establishing a Hawaii emergency management agency in the state department of defense with the functions and authority currently held by the state civil defense agency; establishing the power and authority of the director of Hawaii emergency management, who will be the adjutant general, and providing the director with the functions and authority currently held by the director of civil defense; establishing county emergency management agencies, each to be under the respective county mayor's direction, with the functions and authority currently held by the local organizations for civil defense; and repealing the chapters on disaster relief [chapter 127] and the civil defense [and] emergency act chapter 128, which were determined to be obsolete with the creation of the Hawaii emergency management agency. Conference Committee Report No. 129-14.\n\nAct 51, Session Laws 2022, amended §708-840 to include within the offense of robbery in the first degree a person committing theft or non-consensual taking of a motor vehicle while being armed with an electric gun. The legislature found that the Hawaii Penal Code did not adequately address potential situations in which offenders utilize electric guns to facilitate crimes. Electric guns can cause severe pain and completely incapacitate a person. The legislature noted that criminals could begin to use these devices against others to facilitate crimes as electric guns became more prevalent in the community. Accordingly, Act 51 aimed to deter the use of an electric gun in the commission of a crime, particularly robbery.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 2006, c 230, §43]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §708-842\n\nThe nature and operation of this section is concisely explained by the Model Penal Code:\n\nThis provision is unusual only insofar as it makes classification of robbery depend in part on behavior after the theft might be said to have been accomplished. The thief's willingness to use force against those who would restrain him in flight strongly suggests that he would have employed it to effect the theft had there been need for it. No rule-of-thumb is proposed to delimit the time and space of \"flight,\" which should be interpreted in accordance with the rationale. The concept of \"fresh pursuit\" will be helpful in suggesting realistic bounds between the occasion of the theft and a later occasion when the escaped thief is apprehended.1\n\nPrevious Hawaii statutory law failed to provide a standard for the determination of the duration of the \"theft\" aspect of a robbery--a standard which is needed in order to determine when the employment of force or threatened force converts the \"theft\" into a \"robbery.\"\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-842\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, established motor vehicle theft as part of the offenses of robbery in the first and second degrees.

A discussion of the definitions, when called for, is found in the commentary on the sections employing the terms defined.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-850\n\nAct 155, Session Laws 1988, added the term \"falsely endorses\" to this section. Previously, forging a written instrument did not include false endorsements as a method of forging a written instrument; therefore, false endorsement was prosecuted as a theft. House Standing Committee Report No. 467-88.\n\nAct 13, Session Laws 1993, amended the definition of \"forged instrument\" to specify that a false endorsement is a method of forging a written instrument. The legislature found that this amendment added clarity and consistency to definitions regarding forgery and related offenses in the Penal Code, and was also consistent with the legislative intent as established in Act 155, Session Laws 1988, which included false endorsement as a method of committing the offense of forgery to strengthen the existing forgery laws at that time. House Standing Committee Report No. 84, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1064.\n\nAct 243, Session Laws 1997, made it an offense of forgery if a person fraudulently encoded the magnetic ink character recognition numbers on a written instrument. The Act amended this section by adding a definition for \"fraudulently encode magnetic ink character recognition numbers\". The Act also amended this section by adding \"issuing commercial establishment\" to the class of issuers protected from forgery, false making, false completion, false altering, and false endorsement.\n\nThe legislature found that increasingly advanced technology has changed the way in which commercial paper can be handled between parties. One of the technological changes involved the use of magnetic character recognition numbers that enable scanners to quickly obtain information from the document. Changing the magnetic codes effectively tells the scanner different information than that intended, making it a forgery in fact, if not in name. However, that type of document alteration was not currently prohibited by law. The legislature found that the Act would protect parties in that type of situation. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1551, House Standing Committee Report No. 987.\n\n\"Falsely complete\": in a prosecution for forgery, the element of completing a check without authority of the ostensible drawer may be proven by circumstantial evidence. 79 H. 175 (App.), 900 P.2d 172 (1995).\n\nWhere defendant gave a counterfeit $20 bill to another person, with the intent to defraud, defendant's action constituted an offense pursuant to Hawaii's forgery statutes; although United States currency is not specifically included in the definition of \"written instrument\" in this section, a counterfeit $20 bill falls squarely within that definition in that it is paper, containing printed matter. 134 H. 81 (App.), 332 P.3d 683 (2014).",

      "text": "§708-853 Forgery in the third degree.(1) A person commits the offense of forgery in the third degree if, with intent to defraud, the person falsely makes, completes, endorses, or alters a written instrument, or utters a forged instrument.\n\n(2) Forgery in the third degree is a misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1988, c 155, §4; gen ch 1992]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §708-851 TO 708-853\n\nAs the drafters of the Model Penal Code noted, a revision of the criminal law which deals effectively with theft, fraud, attempt, and complicity diminishes the need for a separate offense of forgery. However, as in the case of the M.P.C.,\n\nWe retain forgery as a distinct offense partly because the concept is so embedded in statute and popular understanding that it would be inconvenient and unlikely that any legislature would completely abandon it, and partly in recognition of the special effectiveness of forgery as a means of undermining public confidence in important symbols of commerce, and of perpetrating large scale frauds.[1]\n\nThe Code establishes three degrees of forgery. The simple and least serious offense is forgery in the third degree, and involves the false making, completion, or alteration of any written instrument. The requisite state of mind is an \"intent to defraud,\" which is specially defined to include knowledge that the actor is facilitating injury to the valuable interest of another, as well as intent to accomplish such injury.[2] \"Written instrument\" is broadly defined by §708-850(1) to include not only written or printed matter, but also coins, stamps, badges, seals, etc., which are evidence of value, right, privilege, or identification. Falsely making, falsely completing, and falsely altering a written instrument are also specifically defined in subsections 708-850(4), (5), and (6), respectively: the essential common element is that the final product falsely purports to be an authentic creation of its ostensible maker. Because truly serious forgeries are dealt with under the offenses of first or second degree forgery, forgery in the third degree is made a misdemeanor.\n\nIf the forged instrument is one which affects a legal right or interest, the offense is considered forgery in the second degree, and the sanction is increased to a class C felony. This category includes wills, deeds, contractual instruments, and generally all negotiable instruments and instruments relating to secured transactions.[3] These instruments are more stringently protected because of (1) the greater potential for individual harm which may generally result from the forgery of such instruments, and (2) the serious business and economic disruptions which would result from the undermining of public confidence in such matters.\n\nForgery, in any of its forms, of governmental or corporate financial issues or instruments, constitutes a class B felony. Impairment of public confidence in instruments or symbols of commerce could have disastrous effect upon governmental processes and the economy in general and clearly represents the most aggravated form of forgery. It is significant, in this regard, that such instruments were the first to be protected by the common law of forgery.[4] Moreover, it is felt that an additional danger exists since the average citizen cannot easily protect oneself against skillfully made forgeries of this kind; and professional criminals are most likely to concentrate on forging such instruments. Note that a forgery in the first degree must appear as part of a series. Thus, for example, only stocks, bonds, stamps, and securities which represent part of a larger issue fall within the definition of this offense. How many individual instruments constitute an issue is a matter left to case-by-case judicial interpretation.[5]\n\nThe Code's definition of the simple offense of forgery is nearly identical to that found in prior Hawaii law: \"Forgery is the fraudulent making or altering a [sic] writing with the intent to deceive another and prejudice him in some right.\"[6] Moreover, Hawaii recognized two degrees of forgery. Forgery of a deed of conveyance, lease, promissory note, bill of exchange, due bill, check, order, and the like, involving a value of $100 or more, was roughly equivalent to the Code's forgery in the second degree, but drew a sentence similar to the Code's class B felony. All other forgery was forgery in the second degree and carried a sentence similar to the Code's class C felony. It is felt that the Code's gradation, solely according to the kind of instrument forged, is more indicative of the actual and potential degree of public and private harm involved. Moreover, the division of the offense into three degrees provides for more equitable treatment of forgery offenders.\n\nHawaii law previously provided an extraordinary penalty for repeated forgery offenses in the form of an additional sentence up to one-half the maximum allowed for last conviction.7 Such severe treatment is rather difficult to justify rationally, and is found in neither the Model Penal Code nor the recent revisions of other states. The Code omits such selective sentencing provisions. The problem of habitual offenders is dealt with generally under chapter 706 (Disposition of Convicted Defendants).\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §708-851 TO 708-853\n\nAct 155, Session Laws 1988, added the term \"endorses\" to these sections. Previously, forging a written instrument did not include false endorsements as a method of forging a written instrument; therefore, false endorsement was prosecuted as a theft. False endorsement, as a theft charge, carried a lighter sentence than forgery. The legislature felt the inclusion of false endorsements in these sections would strengthen the existing forgery laws. House Standing Committee Report No. 467-88, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2550.\n\nAct 243, Session Laws 1997, amended § §708-851 and 708-852 by making it an offense of forgery to fraudulently encode magnetic ink character recognition numbers on a written instrument. The legislature found that increasingly advanced technology has changed the way in which commercial paper can be handled between parties. One of the technological changes involved the use of magnetic character recognition numbers that enable scanners to quickly obtain information from the document. Changing the magnetic codes effectively tells the scanner different information than that intended, making it a forgery in fact, if not in name. However, that type of document alteration was not currently prohibited by law. The legislature found that the Act would protect parties in that type of situation. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1551, House Standing Committee Report No. 987.\n\nAct 147, Session Laws 2021, amended §708-851 to provide that the offense of forgery in the first degree includes forgery of a deed, will, codicil, contract, assignment, commercial instrument, or other instrument affecting a legal right, interest, obligation, or status where: (1) the purported maker or drawer of the instrument is a person who is sixty years of age or older; and (2) the age of the purported maker or drawer is known or reasonably should be known to the person who commits the forgery. Act 147 also amended §708-852 to provide that the offense of forgery in the second degree includes forgery of a written instrument, where: (1) the purported maker or drawer of the instrument is a person who is sixty years of age or older; and (2) the age of the purported maker or drawer is known or reasonably should be known to the person who commits the forgery. The legislature found that the rate of crimes targeting seniors in the State had increased in recent years. The legislature further found that senior citizens are especially vulnerable to long-term physical, emotional, and financial harm from criminal acts and that there was a lack of adequate protection against exploitation of senior citizens under existing law. Act 147 more closely aligned certain Penal Code statutes with common elder abuse scenarios to facilitate appropriate responses by law enforcement and prosecutors.

Note that the requisite intent to defraud, as defined in §708-800, is the same as that required for the forgery offenses.",

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1993, c 33, §2]\n\nRevision Note\n\nIn subsection (3), paragraph designations deleted and punctuation changed pursuant to §23G-15.\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §708-857\n\nThis section is concerned with the passage of worthless negotiable instruments where the actor has knowledge that the instrument will not be honored. Originally, bad check legislation was necessitated by the common-law limitations on promissory fraud: misrepresentation of a future fact was not sufficient to establish theft by deception. Such artificial distinctions are largely obviated by the definition of \"deception\" used in the Code's theft provisions.[1] As noted in the comments to the Proposed Michigan Code,\n\nthe elimination of the promissory fraud doctrine thus eliminates the need for a bad check statute in its traditional form. This might suggest that there is no point served in continuing a bad check statute in the Draft. In answer, the statute can serve a useful purpose when the merchant or bank that is in fact defrauded does not wish to prosecute but the bank on which the bad check is drawn does.[2]\n\nThis section, moreover, protects the prevailing system of negotiable paper in addition to those individuals involved in a given case. Since emphasis in \"bad check\" cases ought to be placed upon the theft, rather than on the bad check itself, the sanction provided for this offense is relatively mild, i.e., a misdemeanor, and the grade of the offense does not, as in the case of theft offenses, vary according to the amount involved.\n\nThe incorporation of the Uniform Commercial Code's definitions of \"issue,\" \"negotiable instrument,\" and \"negotiation\" in subsection (3), is intended to insure that in this area, where protection of commercial transactions are reinforced with criminal sanctions, the civil and penal law are closely correlated. The use of the U.C.C.'s definition of \"negotiation\" insures that the indorser with knowledge or expectation of ultimate nonpayment, as well as the drawer, with such knowledge or expectation, will be covered.\n\nUnder the evidentiary rules established in subsection (2), the prosecution fulfills its initial burden of proving intent by demonstrating, beyond a reasonable doubt, either that the issuer had no account with the drawee, or that such an instrument was not made good within ten days of receipt of notice of dishonor. Again, the definitions of the Uniform Commercial Code are used for both convenience and uniformity. Note, however, the modifications toward leniency necessitated in adapting a civil statute to criminal use: actual, rather than constructive, receipt of notice of dishonor is required before the time in which the actor must make good begins to run. The time period required by subsection (2)(b) does not prevent prosecution before the time has elapsed, but only denies to the prosecution the benefit of that particular evidentiary provision before the stated time has elapsed.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law defined this offense similarly, except that Hawaii law required an intent to defraud.[3] The Code provides that knowledge of insufficient funds is adequate culpability for the imposition of this penalty. Moreover, distinguishing such knowledge from an intent to defraud introduces conceptual niceties of questionable value. Hawaii law also recognized both the prima facie evidence of the requisite culpability based upon insufficient funds and failure to correct the insufficiency within five days.4 The Code attempts to better correlate this offense, both in language and substance, with the civil law relating to negotiable instruments.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-857\n\nAct 33, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by updating cross references to article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which was repealed and replaced by Act 118, Session Laws 1991.

The basic purpose of the section is to provide a single punishment and simple definition for various offenses related to false weights and measures, adulteration, and mislabeling of commodities.\n\nThis section is not intended as detailed regulation of the subject area, but rather only to control the criminal penalties utilized to enforce legislation dealing with deceptive business practices. However, recognizing the tremendous body of law specifically regulating various deceptive business practices and the questionable wisdom of a wholesale modification of that body of law, subsection (5) is included to provide that this section shall not apply where statutes outside the Code specifically provide a penalty for the deceptive practice involved. It should be emphasized that criminal sanctions in this area are an extreme measure, and generally not as effective an enforcement tool as statutory licensing, injunction, and private actions.[1]\n\nSubsection (1) defines the offense and is largely self- explanatory. It should be noted, with respect to the state of mind required for conviction, that although (1) recklessness is a lower level of culpability than acting knowingly, and (2) there is a slight redundancy in including the word \"knowingly\" in the definition of the offense,[2] the clarity of language that is achieved is worth the technical redundancy. Unlike the theft offenses, there is no requirement that (1) defendant obtain property or services, (2) that the defendant obtain by deception, or (3) that the defendant act intentionally. The definitions in subsections (2) and (3) are also self-explanatory. However, it should be pointed out, that all current regulatory standards are included by reference. Where no statutory or regulatory standards exist, it becomes encumbent upon the prosecution to prove a violation of established commercial usage.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law contained many penal provisions for deceptive business practices within Title 38 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes dealing with crimes. Most deceptive practices were covered in the chapter on \"Gross Cheat.\" The penalties in this chapter did not treat similar conduct equally.\n\nThe same anomalies will continue to occur in general regulatory provisions. Deceptive business practices relating to gasoline, fuel, and motor oil warrant a $500 fine or six months' imprisonment or both.[3] For selling other than \"pure quality\" liquor the available sanction is the same,[4] but for selling misbranded or adulterated milk, imprisonment for one year is authorized.5 When this section of the Code is compared with regulatory legislation outside the Code, inconsistencies in sentences can be found. However, these anomalies and inconsistencies are the inevitable result of our determination, in subsection (5), not to use the Penal Code as a vehicle for the wholesale reform of regulatory legislation relating to deceptive business practices.\n\n§708-870 Commentary:\n\n1.

Such conduct probably does not in itself constitute theft by deception, but would rather be considered only preparatory thereto. The requisite culpability, knowledge or recklessness, extends both to the making of the statement and to the deceptive quality thereof. Commonly accepted \"puffing,\" the advertising exaggerations presumed harmless in §708-800, is not intended to be included within the ambit of this section.\n\nSubsection (2) is intended to cover advertising which may not be false on its face, but which is intended as a \"bait\" or \"come-on\" to attract the unwary.[1] A person may be liable under a combined reading of subsections (1) and (2) if the person offers goods or services with intent (a) to charge a higher price than that advertised, (b) to offer in a quantity insufficient to meet reasonably-expected demand, or (c) not to sell them at all. Note that under §702-206, hope that the vendor will not have to sell as advertised suffices to fulfill the requisite culpability of intent. Thus merchants who advertise with hope of persuading customers not to purchase the advertised bargain fall within the ambit of subsection (2).\n\nThe non-culpable medium or agent publishing false advertising is not liable under this section. The requisite culpability applies to the deceptive quality of the advertisement, so that independent publishing agents who are not culpable with regard to the falsity of the advertisement do not fall within the scope of this section.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law dealt with false advertising at considerable length, and was an excellent example of the kind of \"telephone book\" legislation which seeks to provide in advance for all possible individual contingencies, rather than to provide a general proscription.2 The false advertising provisions in the prior Hawaii statute required about three-and-a-half pages of print. Substantively, the Code, in its abbreviated and simplified form, is quite similar to the previous law, except for the Code's somewhat stronger misdemeanor penalty (as opposed to low-grade misdemeanor previously provided).\n\nIn class action brought against major cigarette manufacturers, tobacco trade associations, and the industry's public relations firm, first amended complaint asserted violations of federal RICO statutes; Hawaii's RICO statute, §842-2; federal antitrust statutes; Hawaii's antitrust act, chapter 480; various state common-law torts; and false advertising under this section; defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim granted, where injuries alleged by plaintiffs trust funds in first amended complaint were not direct; even if remoteness doctrine did not bar claims, claims failed for other reasons. 52 F.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §708-873\n\nThe sections dealing with theft are framed in terms of appropriation of property of another; however, a security interest does not make the secured party an owner and the property, by reason of the security interest alone, is not the property of another.[1] It is necessary, therefore, to provide separate penalties for \"debtors or conditional vendees who dispose of property subject to a security interest in ways that may prejudice the secured creditor.\"[2] The requisite culpability is intent to hinder enforcement of the security interest; innocent potential hindering of such interest, such as the temporary removal of a secured chattel from the County or State, ought not to be made subject to criminal sanctions.[3]\n\nThe penalty provided is a misdemeanor, regardless of the amount involved. This differs somewhat from the theft offenses. This difference reflects the fact that generally offenders against a secured interest \"are less dangerously deviated from social norms than outright thieves who take property to which they have no claim.\"[4] Moreover, in those cases where the actor intended, at the time the actor undertook the security obligation, to violate the terms thereof, felony penalties will be available under the theft provisions.[5]\n\nPrevious Hawaii law provided many offenses relating to defrauding secured creditors. These different offenses distinguished between the kind of property involved, i.e., whether real or personal,[6] between the mode of fraud, e.g., whether the property is concealed or sold,[7] and the type of security arrangement involved, e.g., whether a mortgage of personal property or a conditional sale.8 The exact reason for these various provisions, sometimes with different penalties, seems unclear. The Code provides a single unified offense with a single penalty for conduct which ought to be regarded by the penal law as presenting substantially the same type of social harm.\n\n§708-873 Commentary:\n\n1. §708-800.\n\n2.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1976, c 200, pt of §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §708-874\n\nThis section is intended to discourage both knowing violation of fiduciary obligations and knowing misapplication of property belonging either to the government or to a financial institution. In this context the misapplication is in terms of improper and reckless investment or handling of assets, rather than of outright theft. For purposes of this section, a fiduciary includes any person (including a corporation) acting in a fiduciary capacity for another person, and a person acting in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of a corporation or organization which is itself a fiduciary. The requirement of knowledge extends to the substantial risk of loss or detriment to the owner.\n\nMisapplication in this context is not theft; there is no intent permanently to deprive the owner of the owner's property. Moreover, the actor does not misappropriate funds, unless there is a specific duty to make payment to someone else. The danger envisioned is the risk \"that one who administers or controls the property may deliberately depart from the legal rules applicable to his control of the property in question and may gamble with the property at considerable known risk to the safety of the property in question.\"[1]\n\nExisting law provides that a trust company that violates, neglects, or refuses to comply with statutory requirements relating to trusts, and an officer, manager, director, or employee who knowingly participates in such violation, commits a misdemeanor if it or he, as the case may be, fails to desist from the practice within seven days following notification by the Director of the Department of Regulatory Agencies.2 The provision is designed to accomplish certain regulatory ends. The Penal Code does not propose to abolish the regulatory provision; it will, however, in aggravated cases, provide for a direct, unconditional penalty. Where (1) the actor acts knowingly (as opposed to negligently), and (2) the violation of a statutory or administrative requirement amounts to a misapplication of entrusted property (as opposed to violating some other requirement related to trust administration), the warning period is eliminated. There is no need for a warning period if criminal liability is not strictly imposed or predicated on negligence.\n\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\nStudent Symposium: Legal Malpractice, 14 HBJ, no. 1, at 3 (1978).\n\nNo private right of action exists under this section; therefore, plaintiffs cannot state a claim under the section. 131 H. 62, 315 P.3d 213 (2013).\n\n§708-874 Commentary:\n\n1.

To a lesser degree the section serves another secular function: it helps secure independency of business judgment. The premise is that business decisions ought to be made on merit to insure the optimal allocation of resources: bribery undermines this neutral decision-making process in the same way it undermines public administration.[1] Society's interest in promoting civil or commercial fidelity by penalizing those who intentionally violate those rules and in promoting the proper allocation of resources justifies the imposition of a misdemeanor sanction for this offense.\n\nSubsection (1)(a) covers bribe offerors in the commercial context. It covers both agents and appraisers. \"Agent\" is defined broadly in subsection (2)(a) to cover all areas where a duty of fidelity is owed. The nature and scope of such duties are defined by common and statutory law regulating or creating the various legal relationships involved. Thus, for example, the duty of an employee to an employer may be not to give away trade secrets, whereas the duty of a fiduciary to the fiduciary's beneficiary or a union representative of an employee's welfare fund to employees may be to exercise independent judgment. \"Appraiser\" is defined broadly in subsection (2)(b) to include, in addition to conventional forms of appraisal, those forms of appraisal that have recently been involved in the \"payola\" scandals; for example, the bribery of disc jockeys, cinema, theatre and music reviewers, and the like, to \"plug\" or give favorable reviews to a certain recording, movie, play, composition, etc. Inherent is an element of \"consumer protection\": we are concerned that the commodity which the appraiser purports to market, that is independence, neutrality, and expertness of judgment, be protected from any undue influences.\n\nSubsection (1)(b) covers commercial bribe solicitors or receivers. In addition to agents and appraisers, subsection (1)(b)(iii) adds a third category: an agent in charge of employment. The special abuses to which those with power to hire and fire are prone warrant subsection (1)(b)(iii), which sets forth a substantive rule that a benefit shall not be accepted with the intent that some person's status with respect to a job shall be affected thereby, regardless of whether the action constitutes a violation of a duty to a principal. Thus, even though an agent would probably be under a duty to employ the best qualified applicant, acceptance of a benefit from such an applicant should not be allowed.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law recognized no penal offense for bribery in the commercial context. There were provisions affecting bribery of appraisers and arbitrators, but these provisions were clearly concerned with bribery of public or quasi-public officials, rather than with private commercial bribery.2\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §708-880\n\nAct 173, Session Laws 1979, amended subsection (3) to upgrade the offense of commercial bribery to a class C felony in certain instances. The legislature found that the practice of exchanging monetary consideration to influence the discretion of officers in private corporations was perhaps more prevalent and of greater public concern than misdemeanor classification would warrant. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 856.\n\nAct 35, Session Laws 2015, amended subsection (2) by changing the paragraph designations in the definition of \"agent\" and by making a technical nonsubstantive amendment to the definition of \"appraiser.\"\n\n§708-880 Commentary:\n\n1.

It represents a broadening of previous legislation penalizing sports bribery and tampering. Note that publicly-exhibited contest includes, by definition in subsection (2)(a), not only sporting events, but also non-athletic contests, such as quiz shows. In addition to the possibilities of wholesale fraud, there is a substantial element of public affront at rigging or tampering with the outcome of publicly-exhibited contests: witness the quiz show scandals of the last decade. Moreover, it is felt that such behavior should be deterred because it \"subjects legitimate entertainment and advertising to unfair and debasing competition.\"[1] The last part of subsection (2)(a) provides an exception for exhibitions, such as some wrestling spectacles, which do not purport to be and are not represented as being a sport, contest, game or race.\n\nSubsection (1)(a) defines the offense in terms of the bribe offeror's conduct, whether it be addressed to the contest participant or the contest official. Subsection (1)(b) defines the offense in terms of the bribe solicitor or receiver. Finally, subsection (1)(c) is addressed to corruption, not by bribery, but by improper meddling or clandestine substitution.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law recognized the offense of bribery involving participants and officials in professional or amateur sports contests.[2] The sanction provided seems unduly severe; it is roughly equivalent to the Code's sentence for a class C felony. The Code clarifies the language of the offense, broadens its scope, and reduces the available sanction to a misdemeanor.\n\n§708-881 Commentary:\n\n1. M.P.C., Tentative Draft No. 11, comments at 108 (1960).\n\n2. H.R.S. §725-7.\n\nNote on Ticket Scalping, Fortune Telling,\n\nSorcery, and Allied Practices\n\nSome recent penal revisions have continued to make it an offense to scalp tickets.[1] The offense covers issuing or selling tickets: (1) without the price or seat, if any, printed conspicuously on them, (2) for more than the price printed on the ticket or charged at the place of admission, or (3) in violation of a condition making the tickets \"nontransferable.\"[2] Hawaii previously had a law which covered the second mode of ticket scalping.[3] The Model Penal Code does not make such activity an offense and any justification for a penal sanction does not readily appear. The potential harm which could result from the issuing or selling of tickets in blank form is adequately covered by the sections on theft by deception and complicity.\n\nFortune telling has also been made an offense in some codes.[4] Hawaii law previously had such a provision.[5] Again, it is hard to see why this activity should be made a penal offense per se. If the activity amounts, under aggravated circumstances, to theft by deception, the theft sections can be employed. The argument in favor of making fortune telling an offense has been stated by the Michigan revision:\n\nThere may be some question whether this conduct should continue to be criminal. However, persons holding themselves out to possess occult powers very often proceed to take advantage of the gullible and persuade them to turn over money or property. Whilethis activity amounts to theft by deception[citing section], it may be difficult to prove. A prohibition against fortune telling, etc., as such drives the activity underground and reduces somewhat the opportunity to practice frauds.[6]\n\nIn view of the coverage by the offense of theft, the utility to be gained from driving the activity underground seems marginal. Indeed, driving the activity underground would reduce the opportunity to discover and prove theft by deception which arises in this context.\n\nHawaii law previously contained a section making sorcery an offense.[7] Since the section is based on using pretended power to cure another, rather than intent to defraud that person, the practice seems adequately covered and penalized as practicing medicine without a license.8\n\nFor these reasons, the Code intentionally omits provisions making ticket scalping, fortune telling, and sorcery penal offenses.\n\nNote on Ticket Scalping, Fortune Telling, Sorcery, and Allied Practices\n\n1.

[L 2001, c 33, pt of §1; am L 2012, c 293, §6]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §708-890 TO 708-895.7\n\nAct 225, Session Laws 1992, repealed former § §708-890 to 708-896 and added this part [ § §708-890 to 708-893] to expand the degree of protection afforded to individuals and organizations from persons who tamper, interfere, damage, and gain unauthorized access to their computers, computer systems, software, and data. Finding that the growth in computer use has resulted in a similar growth in unauthorized access to computer systems, the legislature created two new offenses of \"computer fraud\" and \"unauthorized computer use,\" both class C felonies. The legislature, however, recognized that other people, including harmless pranksters, students, or curious computer hackers, may gain unauthorized access to computer systems and do no damage to those systems. Although these people have committed a serious breach of privacy, they do not deserve to be charged with a class C felony; the legislature therefore created the affirmative defense of \"entry without disruption,\" authorizing a court to dismiss a prosecution if, having regard for the nature of the alleged conduct and attendant circumstances, it finds that the defendant's conduct did not actually cause harm or damage to a computer system or network. The court must also file a written statement of its reasons for dismissal. Conference Committee Report No. 29.\n\nAct 33, Session Laws 2001, strengthened the State's computer crime laws, by, among other things, replacing statutes relating to computer crimes with several new offenses and provisions to deter computer fraud, damage, and other computer-related perpetrations, allowing the forfeiture of property used in computer crimes, and updating computer-related definitions to reflect modern technology and for clarity. The legislature found that society was adopting at a rapid pace, computer technology to conduct activities of daily living. Computer technology was being utilized not only for purposes of business and recreation, but also for criminal activity. Thus, computer-related criminal activity was on the rise as society's dependence on computers increased. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1508.\n\nAct 3, Session Laws 2003, made a technical amendment to §708-890, by deleting the brackets around the word \"retrieve\" in the definition of \"access.\"\n\nAct 141, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-893 to include the use of a computer to obtain control over the property of the victim [to commit theft in the first or second degree]. The legislature found that the use of a computer to commit theft is a growing problem in Hawaii and the number of crimes perpetrated via the Internet is increasing. Using a computer as an instrument of the crime offers the perpetrator relative anonymity, a quick and easy mechanism to commit fraud, and the potential for sizable financial gain. Hawaii's statutes relating to computer fraud are inadequate for purposes of prosecuting internet fraud. The amendment of §708-893 would enable law enforcement to respond more efficiently to the various forms of computer crime. Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 3116 and 3306.\n\nAct 192, Session Laws 2012, amended §708-893(1) by: (1) establishing that knowingly using a computer to perform certain acts against a victim or intended victim of harassment under §711-1106, or harassment by stalking under §711-1106.5, constitutes the offense of use of a computer in the commission of a separate crime; and (2) clarifying that the offense of use of a computer in the commission of a separate crime also includes knowingly using a computer to pursue, surveil, contact, harass, annoy, or alarm a victim or intended victim. The legislature found that Act 192 would assist in combating cyberbullying and preventing the emotional harm caused by the dissemination of personal information of an individual, whether true or false, via the Internet or wireless cellular communications. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3232.\n\nAct 293, Session Laws 2012, amended §708-891 to update Hawaii's computer crime statutes by adding language mirroring Hawaii's identity theft statutes to better address the realities of modern cybercrime by changing the offense of computer fraud in the first degree from a class B felony to a class A felony. Act 293 was intended to streamline and update computer crime statutes to better address and combat cybercrime. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3230, Conference Committee Report No. 36-12.\n\nAct 293, Session Laws 2012, amended §708-891.5 to update Hawaii's computer crime statutes by adding language mirroring Hawaii's identity theft statutes to better address the realities of modern cybercrime by changing the offense of computer fraud in the second degree from a class C felony to a class B felony. Act 293 was intended to streamline and update computer crime statutes to better address and combat cybercrime. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3230, Conference Committee Report No. 36-12.\n\nAct 293, Session Laws 2012, added §708-891.6 to establish a new offense of computer fraud in the third degree as a class C felony to update Hawaii's computer crime statutes, adding language mirroring Hawaii's identity theft statutes to better address the realities of modern cybercrime. Act 293 was intended to streamline and update computer crime statutes to better address and combat cybercrime. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3230, Conference Committee Report No. 36-12.\n\nAct 293, Session Laws 2012, amended §708-895.5 to update Hawaii's computer crime statutes by adding language mirroring Hawaii's identity theft statutes to better address the realities of modern cybercrime by: (1) changing the offense of unauthorized computer access in the first degree from a class B felony to a class A felony; and (2) increasing the minimum value of information obtained that constitutes unauthorized computer access in the first degree from $5,000 to $20,000. Act 293 was intended to streamline and update computer crime statutes to better address and combat cybercrime. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3230, Conference Committee Report No. 36-12.\n\nAct 293, Session Laws 2012, amended §708-895.6 to update Hawaii's computer crime statutes by adding language mirroring Hawaii's identity theft statutes to better address the realities of modern cybercrime by changing the offense of unauthorized computer access in the second degree from a class C to a class B felony. Act 293 was intended to streamline and update computer crime statutes to better address and combat cybercrime. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3230, Conference Committee Report No. 36-12.\n\nAct 293, Session Laws 2012, amended §708-895.7 to update Hawaii's computer crime statutes by adding language mirroring Hawaii's identity theft statutes to better address the realities of modern cybercrime by changing the offense of unauthorized computer access in the third degree from a misdemeanor to a class C felony. Act 293 was intended to streamline and update computer crime statutes to better address and combat cybercrime. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3230, Conference Committee Report No. 36-12.\n\nAct 213, Session Laws 2014, (1) created and established as a class C felony the offense of computer damage in the third degree [( §708-892.6)] as knowingly accessing a computer, computer system, or computer network without authorization and recklessly causing damage; (2) redefined and increased to a class A felony the offense of computer damage in the first degree [( §708-892)] as intentionally causing or attempting to cause damage to a computer, computer system, or computer network that manages or controls any critical infrastructure and specified that the offense applies to damage to state and federal critical infrastructure; (3) redefined and increased to a class B felony the offense of computer damage in the second degree [( §708-892.5)] as knowingly causing the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and thereby knowingly causing unauthorized damage to a computer, computer system, or computer network, or intentionally accessing a computer, computer system, or computer network without authorization, and thereby knowingly causing damage; and (4) added a new definition of \"critical infrastructure\" [( §708-890)]. The legislature found that existing law only applied when a perpetrator used a computer to damage another computer, such as by hacking or transmitting a computer virus. However, greater protections were needed for [computers managing or controlling] critical infrastructure, as damage to these computers jeopardized public health, safety, and security, regardless of how the damage occurred. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2452, House Standing Committee Report No. 1100-14.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended §708-893(1) by repealing a provision that subjects a person to a separate charge and enhanced penalty for using a computer to commit an underlying theft crime. The amendment implemented the recommendation made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015). The Penal Code Review Committee commented, on page 51 of its report:\n\nCurrently, the enhanced penalties for use of a computer in the commission of a separate crime converts first-degree theft into a class A felony and second-degree theft into a class B felony. The definition of \"computer\" for purposes of this section would appear to include devices such as smartphones. Given the prevalence of such devices and the widespread use of \"computers\" in today's society in general, imposing the enhanced penalties for the use of a computer in committing theft seems unduly harsh.\n\nHouse Standing Committee Report No. 660-16.\n\nAct 184, Session Laws 2021, amended §708-893 to add aggravated harassment by stalking to the list of offenses upon which the offense of use of a computer in the commission of a separate crime may be based. Act 184 also amended §708-894 to provide courts with the discretion to require the forfeiture of property used in computer crimes if the perpetrator was a minor, regardless of whether the minor owned the property. The legislature found that bullying, cyberbullying, and harassment are serious issues that hinder student well-being and achievement, especially when the targets are vulnerable youth. The legislature further found that although the department of education had recently implemented comprehensive efforts to address bullying, cyberbullying, and harassment in public schools, including the adoption of amended administrative rules that, among other things, provided expanded definitions of and complaint procedures for these forms of student misconduct, the transition to online classroom environments as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic had exacerbated the problems of bullying, cyberbullying, and harassment of vulnerable youth. The legislature found that Act 184 would provide further incentive to parents and guardians to better ensure that their minor children would refrain from using electronic devices to perpetrate bullying, cyberbullying, and harassment.

Apart from this change, credit card offense penalties were made more severe in recognition of the increase in the criminal abuse of credit cards. Also, Act 314 barred the disclosure of credit cardholder lists, except in limited circumstances, because the procurement from stores and credit bureaus of those lists increases the likelihood of credit card fraud and theft. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 820-86, Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\nAct 55, Session Laws 1988, amended §708-8100 by lowering the value of money, goods, and services, required as an element of credit card fraud in the class C felony category, from $500 to $300. This amendment makes this section uniform with similar statutory crimes. House Standing Committee Report No. 1173-88.\n\nAct 287, Session Laws 1993, added §708-8100.5 to provide criminal sanctions for the fraudulent encoding of a credit card. The legislature found that criminal elements are now capable of changing the magnetic encoding on a credit card to match a usable code and then use the card without detection, resulting in tremendous potential loss to the State's commerce. The legislature further found that because this type of crime is more serious and sophisticated than simple credit card fraud or simple theft and the potential for economic loss is so great, classification of this offense as a class B felony is appropriate. Conference Committee Report No. 102.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §708-8100(2) to provide that each separate use of a stolen credit card that exceeds $300 can be charged as a separate incident.

The Act was intended to expand the scope of the law establishing the offense of telecommunication service fraud, to include fraud involving cellular telephone devices and services. The legislature recognized that cellular telephone fraud had become a major problem in the country, increasing consumer costs, and contributing to increased drug-related criminal activity, and that current state law did not provide comprehensive protection for telecommunication services theft.

[L 2012, c 244, pt of §1; am L 2013, c 26, §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §708-8300 TO 708-8305\n\nAct 244, Session Laws 2012, added these sections to deter unlicensed contracting activity. Specifically, Act 244 added a new part containing these sections to chapter 708 that established: (1) misdemeanor and felony offenses relating to unlicensed contracting activity; (2) felony offenses relating to unlicensed contractor fraud; and (3) a method for valuation of property in unlicensed contractor fraud cases. The legislature found that unlicensed contractors often operate without regard to safety and building requirements, unfairly undercut legitimate and licensed business operations, place consumers at risk, and cost the State millions of dollars in lost tax revenue. The legislature further found that unlicensed contractors often continue to engage in illegal work despite receiving civil penalties. Authorizing the imposition of criminal penalties on unlicensed contractors would help reduce the number of unlicensed contractors performing illegal work, promote legitimate businesses, protect consumers, and enhance state revenues. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3348, Conference Committee Report No. 59-12.\n\nAct 26, Session Laws 2013, amended §708-8305 to clarify that the value of any work done by an unlicensed contractor shall not be used as an offset in calculating the value of the property in unlicensed contractor fraud cases. Minimum thresholds for the total value of the property over which a person obtains control must be met in order for an act to constitute unlicensed contractor fraud in the first or second degree. By permitting an offset of the value of work illegally performed by an unlicensed contractor, the value of the property was less likely to meet the threshold necessary to constitute the offense. Act 26 made it clear that no offset should be applied when calculating the property value for the offenses. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 456, House Standing Committee Report No. 1410.\n\nAct 182, Session Laws 2013, amended §708-8300(1) by clarifying that a contractor who inadvertently fails to maintain licensing requirements and who subsequently corrects the failure so that there was a lapse of no more than sixty days in licensure shall not be guilty of unlicensed contracting activity. Act 182 was intended to clarify that contractors licensed under chapter 444, who inadvertently failed to renew their licenses should not be treated as unlicensed contractors after the subsequent renewal of their licenses. Act 182 was consistent with existing licensure requirements under chapter 444, by clarifying that a lapse in licensure of no more than sixty days does not constitute unlicensed contracting activity.
