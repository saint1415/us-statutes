[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §10; am L 2022, c 43, §6]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-600\n\nThis section establishes that dispositions for all offenses--whether defined within or outside of the Penal Code--are to be imposed in accordance with this chapter and that, except for the power of the court to impose \"incidental civil sanctions such as forfeitures of property, suspension or cancellation of licenses, removal from office and the like,\" as provided in §706-605(4), \"the only dispositions authorized are those permitted by the Code.\"[1]\n\nThe Penal Code, in centralizing provisions relating to the disposition of convicted defendants in one chapter, differs from previous law which provided a separate sanction (fine or imprisonment or both) for each offense. This resulted in authorized sentences which, when considered in relation to the potential danger to the person resulting from the commission of each offense, gave rise to a sense of inconsistency. An act of destruction of real or personal property with intent to hinder the United States in its military preparations was given a 20-year sentence and a $10,000 fine[2] while kidnapping was deemed worthy of a life sentence but only a $1,000[3] fine. An offense delicately called \"carnal abuse\" of a female child under twelve years of age was punishable by life imprisonment,[4] whereas manslaughter, defined as killing without malice aforethought, received a relatively lenient ten-year sentence.[5] Larceny from the person drew a two-year sentence and a $2,000 fine,[6] whereas simple larceny, not involving any potential danger to the person, was punished by a ten-year sentence but no fine at all.7 None of the penalties mentioned is inherently wrong, although most are questionable, but taken together they reflect no consistent policy.\n\nBy centralizing sentencing the Code seeks to achieve an internal consistency which is lacking under previous law.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-600\n\nAct 43, Session Laws 2022, made conforming amendments to this section to authorize the imposition of sentences for offenses in accordance with applicable laws other than as provided in chapter 706. These conforming amendments facilitated other amendments made by Act 43 clarifying that a court is required to impose a sentence for domestic violence intervention, with or without probation, for violations of restraining orders, orders for protection, and abuse of family or household members. The legislature found that §586-4 authorizes a family court to order a violator of a temporary restraining order to undergo mandatory domestic violence intervention. However, the legislature found that the Hawaii Supreme Court misinterpreted §586-4(e) by holding that domestic violence intervention may only be ordered as a condition of probation. The legislature noted that domestic violence intervention, which includes anger management and domestic violence treatment, is an important part of addressing the root causes of domestic violence. Act 43 highlighted the importance of domestic violence intervention and clarified legislative intent by clearly mandating domestic violence intervention regardless of whether persons are sentenced with or without probation for violations of restraining orders, orders for protection, or abuse of family or household members. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3853, House Standing Committee Report No. 777-22, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3444.\n\nAs §706-661 and this section do not authorize a court to impose a single sentence on a defendant who has been convicted of multiple charges, trial court did not violate plea agreement by imposing a life term for each class A felony defendant was convicted of, and then running each life term concurrently. 91 H. 20, 979 P.2d 1046 (1999).\n\n§706-600 Commentary:\n\n1.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §11; am L 1997, c 275, §1; am L 2016, c 231, §15]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-601\n\nIn any system which vests discretion in the sentencing authority, it is necessary that the authority have sufficient and accurate information so that it may rationally exercise its discretion. In our penal system which vests sentencing authority in the court, it is extremely unlikely that without a special provision providing for a pre-sentence investigation and report that the relevant information will be brought to the attention of the court. The vast majority of cases are disposed of upon pleas of guilty. It is obvious that in such cases the court has no information upon which to select between and among various sentencing alternatives. Even where the case is tried before the sentencing judge, the evidence at trial is not likely to produce information relevant to sentencing a subsequently convicted defendant. Relevant information, such as the defendant's history of delinquency or criminality, physical and mental condition, family situation and background, economic status, education, occupation, and personal habits, are not likely to be fully explored in an adversary proceeding designed to decide the issue of guilt.\n\nThis section requires a pre-sentence investigation in the cases specified; it allows the court to order a pre-sentence investigation in any other case. In a system with unlimited resources, a pre-sentence investigation and report might be required in the case of every convicted defendant regardless of whether the offense was a felony, misdemeanor, or violation. However, realizing the limitations of the State's resources, the Code has required a pre-sentence investigation and report only in cases of felons and youthful offenders. This requirement is in substantial accord with recent studies on sentencing.[1]\n\nThis section is also in substantial accord with Hawaii rules of procedure governing criminal cases in the circuit courts,2 which have jurisdiction over felony cases and over some misdemeanor cases (those which are tried before a jury). However, it is left to the circuit court's discretion whether a pre-sentence investigation and report is or is not ordered. In candor, it must be pointed out that as a regular practice such reports are ordered and the Code in large degree brings the law into conformity with existing circuit court practice.\n\nDistrict courts, which have original jurisdiction over misdemeanor cases, presently have no procedure or authorization for pre-sentence investigation. Supplemental services will have to be added to the district courts, either by legislation, court rule, or administratively, so the pre-sentence investigators (probation officers or otherwise) are available in all courts which would be required or authorized to take into consideration a pre-sentence report before imposing sentence.\n\nSubsection (3) was added to the Code to accommodate the request of some defendants for immediate sentence. The court has sometimes granted this request where the offense is of a very minor nature and the court is inclined to impose only a fine or to suspend imposition of sentence.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-601\n\nIn 1972 the legislature, when enacting the Penal Code, substituted the phrase \"pre-sentence correctional diagnosis\" for \"pre-sentence investigation,\" in order to conform the language to the new correctional procedures provided for with the establishment of the Correctional Diagnostic Center. The Conference Committee stated that \"a 'correctional diagnosis' will provide a more comprehensive psychiatric, social, and correctional analysis of a defendant than previously provided with a 'pre-sentence investigation'.\" Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\nAct 275, Session Laws 1997, amended this section to allow courts to waive the pre-sentence diagnosis and report under certain specified circumstances. The legislature found that under current law, a pre-sentence diagnosis and report must be prepared for all individuals convicted of a felony offense and all convicted defendants less than twenty-two years of age, unless the report is waived by both the defendant and the prosecuting attorney. However, in certain cases, the sentence to be imposed is predetermined due to plea agreements or sentencing guidelines; thus, the diagnosis and report are unnecessary. The amendment expedites the disposal of criminal cases and reduces unnecessary delays in sentencing. Conference Committee Report No. 72, House Standing Committee Report No. 1650.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (3) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nRules of Court\n\nPlea agreements, see HRPP rule 11(f).\n\nCommentary quoted in holding that it was proper to include in a pre-sentence diagnosis and report the defendant's juvenile court record for consideration by the sentencing court. 56 H. 75, 527 P.2d 1269 (1974).\n\nIn extended sentence hearing, pre-sentence report held inadmissible hearsay. 56 H. 628, 548 P.2d 632 (1976).\n\nCited as requiring court to consider pre-sentence report before sentencing for a felony. 60 H. 100, 588 P.2d 409 (1978).\n\nIn resentencing cases, ordering of updated pre-sentence report is within discretion of court. 61 H. 226, 602 P.2d 13 (1979).\n\nNo merit to defendant's point on appeal that contended that circuit court violated right to due process when it assumed role of prosecutor and attempted to establish a record on which to base a minimum mandatory sentence; circuit court was mandated by this section and §706-606.5 to do what it did. 9 H. App. 583, 854 P.2d 238 (1993).\n\nPre-sentence report sufficiently complied with §706-602 and chapter 706 was not violated, where defendant asserted that court did not order or receive a pre-sentence correctional diagnosis and report as required by subsection (1)(a), therefore, since the information required under §706-602 was not furnished to the court for its consideration in imposing sentence, the sentences were not imposed in accordance with provisions of chapter 706 and were illegal. 10 H.

The Code recognizes that these topics constitute a minimum of the information which should be before the sentencing judge. Additional matters may be included by the pre-sentence investigator. A defendant is protected against the inclusion of unfounded facts, derogatory information, statements and conclusions by the provision of §706-604 providing for notice and opportunity to controvert.\n\nThis section is in accord with existing Hawaii rules of procedure1 and, although it is somewhat more specific, it has been approved by the Adult Probation Office of the First Circuit.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-602\n\nIn enacting the Code, the legislature changed the Proposed Draft by substituting the phrase \"pre-sentence diagnosis\" for the phrase \"pre-sentence investigation\". (See Supplemental Commentary on §706-601.)\n\nAct 179, Session Laws 1973, amended this section to provide that the pre-sentence diagnosis and report shall \"be made by personnel assigned to the court, intake center, or other agency designated by the court.\" This amendment was made as part of an extensive act implementing that portion of the Hawaii Correctional Master Plan pertaining to the management and establishment of intake service centers, correctional facilities, and programs.\n\nAct 89, Session Laws 1975, amended this section to require that an analysis of the convicted person's ability to make restitution to the victim of the convicted person's crime be included in the pre-sentence diagnosis and report. As amended, the section further requires appropriate personnel to notify the victim of the victim's right to restitution. The intent of the legislature was to repay the victim for the victim's loss and develop in the convicted person \"...a degree of self-respect and pride in knowing that he or she has righted the wrong committed.\" Senate Standing Committee Report No. 789, House Standing Committee Report No. 425.\n\nAct 256, Session Laws 1990, amended this section to require the inclusion of information on the effect of the crime to the victim in all pre-sentencing reports submitted to the courts. The legislature believed that sentencing decisions which are based solely on the circumstances of the defendant's prior history and on an abstract view of the offense are decisions made in a vacuum. The legislature was convinced that the sentencing judge should, therefore, be informed of the impact which the offense has had on the victim as a representative of the entire community because criminal proceedings are brought on behalf of and intended to protect everyone. House Standing Committee Report No. 1193-90.\n\nAct 215, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to provide that the pre-sentence diagnosis and report shall include information concerning the defendant's compliance or noncompliance with any order issued to the defendant pursuant to §806-11, at the time of arraignment, to dispose of all firearms and ammunition within the defendant's possession in a manner in compliance with chapter 134 within forty-eight hours of the issuance of the order. Conference Committee Report No. 66.\n\nAct 240, Session Laws 1998, renamed the criminal injuries compensation commission to the crime victim compensation commission to more accurately reflect the commission's purpose. This section was amended to conform to that name change. House Standing Committee Report No. 1060-98.\n\nAct 51, Session Laws 2012, amended this section by deleting the Intake Service Center as an agency responsible for preparing the pre-sentence diagnosis and report for defendants and for giving notices of the Crime Victim Compensation Act and other specified restitution procedures to increase efficiency in the pre-sentence investigative process as it relates to convicted defendants. The legislature found that Act 51 updated the law relating to pre-sentence investigation process and reporting and correctly designated pre-sentence investigation and reporting duties to the Judiciary. House Standing Committee Report No. 607-12, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3187.\n\n\"History of delinquency\" construed to authorize use of defendant's juvenile record in pre-sentence report, and such use is not a violation of § §571-49 and 571-84. 56 H. 75, 527 P.2d 1269 (1974).\n\nPre-sentence report sufficiently complied with this section and chapter 706 was not violated, where defendant asserted that court did not order or receive a pre-sentence correctional diagnosis and report as required by §706-601(1)(a), therefore, since the information required under this section was not furnished to the court for its consideration in imposing sentence, the sentences were not imposed in accordance with provisions of chapter 706 and were illegal. 10 H.

The court may reduce the monetary assessment if the court finds, based on evidence presented by the defendant and not rebutted by the State, that the defendant is not and will not be able to pay the full monetary assessment and, based on the finding, shall instead order the defendant to pay an assessment that the defendant will be able to pay within five years.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the assessment and penalty provided by this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, and shall not be used to offset or reduce, any fine or restitution authorized or required by law.

It is clear that in deciding which of numerous sentencing alternatives should be employed--e.g., fine, suspended sentence, probation (and the conditions thereof), or imprisonment--the court will need and should be allowed to call upon the professional insights of medical experts. The need for such professional help has been well stated in the A.B.A. Standards:\n\nReliance on the trial court for such significant correctional decisions suggests the imperative need for informational services beyond the normal pre-sentence report. There will inevitably be instances in which the pre-sentence report together with other information acquired during the trial will either leave the court short of desired information or will have raised additional questions which can only be answered by an examination of the defendant's physical, emotional or mental condition. The lack of access to facilities which can supply such information will force the court to an uninformed guess as to the proper disposition.\n\nToo much is at stake to place the court in such a position. On occasion the simple correction of a physical defect has altered the course of a seemingly incorrigible offender. The use of prison in such a context could reinforce the offender's anti-social tendencies. Similarly, the pattern of psychiatric study followed by appropriate treatment offers significant advantages over the simple detention which characterizes so many of our prisons. The system needs the ability to discover the cases where unusual factors may indicate the desirability of an unusual disposition. The availability of facilities such as are contemplated by this section is one step in providing that capability.[1]\n\nThe Code does not deal with the question of whether the State should establish one or more reception and diagnostic centers to meet the needs of sentencing courts or whether the court's needs should be met by the employment on a case-by-case basis of local physicians and psychiatrists.2 That decision will have to be made eventually, however, the Code is formulated in a manner which allows for future expansion of facilities in this area.\n\nThis section represents a needed addition to Hawaii law.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-603\n\nAct 179, Session Laws 1973, amended this section to permit a convicted defendant to be remanded to an intake service center or community correctional center in addition to a clinic or hospital. This amendment was part of the implementation of the Hawaii Correctional Master Plan. (See Supplemental Commentary on §706-602.)\n\nAct 54, Session Laws 1974, amended this section to permit the use of a certified clinical psychologist in making a pre-sentence diagnosis or evaluation. (Cf. Supplemental Commentary on § §704-404, 411, and 414.)\n\nAct 3, Session Laws 1979, amended this section by providing for a three member examination panel (to be appointed in the same manner as the examination panels in § §704-404, 411, and 414) as the sole alternative to a single examiner. This was done to allow greater flexibility in appointing mental health professionals to the panels. Act 105 amended this section to restore language inadvertently deleted by Act 54, Session Laws 1974.\n\nAct 232, Session Laws 1980, amended this section to restore amendments made by Act 3, §4, Session Laws 1979, which were superseded by Act 105, Session Laws 1979, under a general supersession clause.\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, amended \"certified clinical psychologists\" to \"licensed psychologists.\" This change was made because psychologists are licensed and not certified and the term \"clinical\" does not accurately describe psychologists qualified to determine penal responsibility and fitness to proceed. Act 314 also provided an exception to the licensure requirement which recognizes that under §465-3(4), psychologists employed under government certification or civil service rules are exempt from the licensure requirement. Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\nAct 145, Session Laws 1987, permitted the department of health to set minimum standards for participation and appointment of a sanity examiner. The legislature felt this change would allow additional assurances of higher quality testimony by these examiners. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 691, House Standing Committee Report No. 1217.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 1991, required the court to order a defendant convicted of a sexual offense, a violent crime, or the attempt of either, to submit to blood and saliva testing to be used for a DNA identification profile which will allow law enforcement officials to identify reoffenders. The legislature weighed the balance between the defendant's right to privacy and the needs of society, and found that the needs of society to deter sexual and violent crimes outweighed the defendant's right to privacy. House Standing Committee Report No. 1018.\n\nAct 271, Session Laws 1998, amended this section to require defendants convicted of sexual or violent offenses to provide blood samples for DNA analysis. The court is allowed to order convicted defendants to pay a monetary assessment of $500 or the actual cost of DNA analysis, whichever is less, to defray the costs of obtaining, storing, and testing the blood sample. Act 271 created a DNA registry special fund, administered by the attorney general, into which the monetary assessments are to be deposited. A person who negligently or recklessly fails to provide blood samples is guilty of a misdemeanor, and a person who intentionally or knowingly fails to provide blood samples is guilty of a class C felony.\n\nThe legislature recognized that DNA information is an increasingly valuable tool for investigating, prosecuting, and defending criminal cases. The legislature found that the development of a DNA registry is important to protect the public from further criminal acts committed by the offenders, but that the cost of the DNA sampling process is borne by police departments without state funding. The legislature agreed that convicted defendants who are required to provide DNA samples should be assessed a fee to defray the costs of testing. Conference Committee Report No. 110, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3009.\n\nAct 157, Session Laws 2001, amended this section, among others, to conform amendments relating to revocation of motor vehicle registrations under administrative revocation proceedings with the comprehensive law regarding driving under the influence which is to take effect on January 1, 2002. Act 157 conformed and consolidated the provisions of Act 189, Session Laws 2000, to existing law regarding driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and suspension and revocation of licenses. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1406.\n\nAct 112, Session Laws 2005, established a statewide DNA database and data bank identification program for all convicted felons. Conference Committee Report No. 184. Act 112 amended this section by deleting the provisions regarding blood samples for DNA analysis and by requiring every convicted felon to pay a monetary assessment of $500 or the actual cost of the DNA analysis, whichever is less.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (4) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 113, Session Laws 2018, amended this section to authorize use of the DNA registry special fund for the Hawaii sexual assault response and training program established pursuant to chapter 844G and the associated costs for testing and storage of sexual assault evidence collection kits. Act 113 established a Hawaii sexual assault response and training program to address the manner in which sexual assault evidence collection kits are processed and tracked and ensure that victims of sexual assault are informed of their rights under the law. The legislature found that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence is a powerful law enforcement tool that can identify unknown suspects, connect crimes to known perpetrators, and exonerate the innocent. The legislature further found that DNA evidence is especially vital in cases of sexual assault and that Act 113 would help ensure that sexual assault evidence collection kits are tested in a timely manner.

The right of the defendant to controvert the pre-sentence report is meaningless to the extent that the report, or a part thereof, is not made available to the defendant.\n\nThe Model Sentencing Act allows the court discretion in making the pre-sentence report available in ordinary felony cases, but with respect to murderers and dangerous offenders the report is made available in its entirety. The Act further provides that \"Subject to the control of the court, the defendant shall be entitled to cross-examine those who have rendered reports to the court.\"[2]\n\nThe Model Penal Code provides that \"the Court shall advise the defendant or his counsel of the factual contents and the conclusions of any pre-sentence investigation or psychiatric examination and afford fair opportunity, if the defendant so requests, to controvert them. The sources of confidential information need not, however, be disclosed.\"[3]\n\nThe applicable Hawaii rule of criminal procedure takes the same position as the Model Penal Code. It reads:\n\nThe court shall upon request seasonably made disclose the information contained in the report to the prosecution or to the defendant's attorney or the defendant without disclosing any source of information which was received in confidence, and in such event the court shall make the same disclosure to the other party.[4]\n\nThe right to controvert is meaningless unless the report itself, rather than the factual contents and conclusions, is made available to the defendant. Even more ludicrous would be the insertion into the report of information the source of which is regarded as confidential. The defendant, under such circumstances could not be expected to controvert such information by showing, for example, that the source was unreliable or biased. The question of whether the defendant should be sentenced to imprisonment or to probation is no less significant than the question of guilt and the defendant should not have this decision made on the basis of information which the defendant is not allowed an opportunity to challenge.\n\nThe A.B.A. Standards have, for the most part, accepted this approach.[5] In rejecting the M.S.A. and M.P.C. positions, the commentary to the A.B.A. Standards states:\n\nThe view which is reflected in subsection (b) [of 4.4] is based upon both an assessment of the values which are served by non-disclosure and a balance of these values against basic fairness to the defendant. Specifically, the argument that sources of information will dry up if the defendant's attorney is permitted to examine the report falters on two grounds.\n\nThe first is based on the experience of those members of the Committee who have lived under a system in which disclosure is routine, and is supplemented by the Committee's examination of sample reports produced under such a system. The conclusion is that there is little factual basis for the fear that information will become unavailable if the report is disclosed. The quality and value of a pre-sentence report will turn to an infinitely greater extent on the skill of the probation service and the availability of adequate supporting facilities than it will on whether its contents remain a secret....\n\nThe second reason is more fundamental. One of the basic values underlying the manner in which the guilt phase of a criminal case proceeds is that the defendant is entitled to know the details of the charge against him and is entitled to an opportunity to respond. It is believed that this value is subverted by a system which does not require disclosure of the information contained in the pre-sentence report.[6]\n\nThe Code takes the position that full disclosure is necessary to protect the defendant and the court from inaccuracies which secret reports breed. Anything less than full disclosure is inconsistent with the truth-seeking function of the judicial process and the rehabilitative function of penal sentences. \"Long since exploded is the theory that a defendant who has been convicted of crime no longer has any rights, or that any sentence less than the maximum is the result of an act of grace.\"[7]\n\nThe A.B.A. Standards include the following provision for nondisclosure in certain \"extraordinary cases\":\n\nIn extraordinary cases, the court should be permitted to except from disclosure parts of the report which are not relevant to a proper sentence, diagnostic opinion which might seriously disrupt a program of rehabilitation, or sources of information which has been obtained on a promise of confidentiality. In all cases where parts of the report are not disclosed under such authority, the court should be required to state for the record the reasons for its action and to inform the defendant and his attorney that information has not been disclosed. The action of the court in excepting information from disclosure should be subject to appellate review.[8]\n\nThe Code rejects this exception, even in its limited form. The Code takes the position that it would be better to delete such information from the pre-sentence report--information which by its very nature is questionable because of its secrecy--than to allow the information to be included in the report and not be made available to the defendant. Although not dealt with specifically in the A.B.A. Standards, the decision to except a part of the pre-sentence report from disclosure would be essentially an ex parte proceeding, thus further excluding the defendant from participation in the resolution of issues which affect the defendant's rights. The entire exception, and its attendant procedure, seems at best to be a compromise solution on the part of A.B.A.'s Advisory Committee whose commentary reads in part:\n\nBy endorsing a general policy in favor of disclosure, by making non-disclosure of specific items a burdensome task to be justified as an exception, and by providing for review to determine whether non-disclosure was justified, the majority believes that the danger will be minimized, but that an outlet will be available to accommodate justifiable fears in particular cases. In a very few cases, this position will result in disclosure of information which the advocates of secrecy would prefer not to disclose. Such is the price of a system which derives value from the fairness with which it operates.9\n\nIn Honolulu a copy of the pre-sentence investigation report when ordered by the court is routinely furnished to defense counsel. It does not appear from current practice that the untoward results feared by the advocates of secrecy result from full disclosure. Furthermore, the Office of Adult Probation, as a matter of administrative practice, excepts from its reports information given by an informant who seeks to remain anonymous. Even when the probation authorities were charged with investigating custody matters in domestic relations cases, a practice which no longer obtains, they refrained from this utilization of confidential information. The actual procedure in Hawaii appears to be more advanced than its laws in this area. The Code brings the law into step with current practice.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-604\n\nAct 305, Session Laws 1988, included licensed psychologists among the professionals which may provide offender examination services to the Hawaii criminal justice system. The legislature stated that the present laws, which permit only psychiatric evaluation, are inconsistent with the many and varied uses the court has found for the services of licensed psychologists. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2153.\n\nAct 216, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to afford a fair opportunity to a victim, or in certain cases, the victim's family, to be heard on the issue of the defendant's disposition before sentence is imposed. The legislature anticipated that, in those instances in which the victim or family may be unable to personally attend a hearing, the court would accept and consider written statements for the purpose of allowing an opportunity to be heard. Conference Committee Report No. 60.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to require the court to amend an examiner's report upon finding that any correction, modification, or addition is needed. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (3) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to replace references to \"department of public safety\" with \"department of corrections and rehabilitation\" to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation. The legislature further found that reorganizing certain state law enforcement functions into a single entity with consistent training opportunities would allow for the efficient use of resources in administering correctional programs and improve decision making, promote accountability, streamline communication, decrease costs, reduce duplication of efforts, provide uniform training and standards, and promote uniform standards of law enforcement services.

With the exceptions of civil commitment in lieu of sentence and mandatory life imprisonment for murder, the authorized dispositions for crimes are: suspension of sentence, fine, probation, imprisonment, probation with limited imprisonment, fine and probation, and fine and imprisonment. Subsection (2) makes clear that, with respect to violations, only suspension of sentence or a fine are authorized.\n\nThe Code departs from previous practice in that it authorizes suspension of the sentence but does not authorize imposition of sentence and suspension of its execution.[1] If suspension of sentence works out badly and the court subsequently determines that a sentence must be imposed upon the defendant, the correct sentence ought to be determined at the time of imposition rather than at the prior time when the court ordered its suspension. The facts which give rise to the need for imposition and execution of sentence should, of course, be made the subject of an up-to-date pre-sentence investigation and report. The judge ordering suspension of sentence (or suspension of execution) cannot be expected at the time of suspension to formulate a contingent sentence which will account for subsequent facts.\n\nProbation is treated as a specific sentence rather than being treated as \"the accompaniment of suspension.\"[2] Previous practice was to suspend either imposition or execution of sentence and to place the defendant on probation. As the Model Penal Code commentary points out: \"The matter is of relatively minor moment but may serve in some respects to focus thought upon probation as an independent sanction, a result we think important to achieve.\"[3]\n\nWith the exception of murder (see §706-606), the Code does not exclude the possibility of suspension of sentence or probation in cases of offenses thought to be particularly heinous. This is contrary to previous law which provided mandatory imprisonment in cases of murder in the first or second degree, rape, carnal abuse of a female under the age of twelve, incest between parents and children or stepchildren, arson, kidnapping, robbery in the first degree, burglary in the first degree when armed with a deadly weapon, embezzlement of public moneys, and the giving or accepting of a bribe or extortion by a public officer, agent or employee.[4] Although imprisonment would most likely be warranted upon conviction on these types of serious offenses, the Code takes the position that, with the exception of murder, the legislature should not compel imprisonment for any crime before the circumstances of the crime and facts concerning the defendant are known to the sentencing authority.\n\nThis provision rests on the view that no legislative definition or classification of offenses can take account of all contingencies. However right it may be to take the gravest view of an offense in general, there will be cases comprehended in the definition where the circumstances were so unusual, or the mitigations so extreme, that a suspended sentence or probation would be proper. We see no reason to distrust the courts upon this matter or to fear that such authority will be abused.[5]\n\nSubsection (3) indicates that the special problems presented by corporate or associational defendants are dealt with in §706-608.\n\nSubsection (4) reserves for the court the authority which has been conferred upon it by law to declare forfeiture, suspend or cancel licenses, remove persons from office and impose other penalties which are civil in nature. The court in a criminal case retains its power to impose, in addition to authorized penal sanctions, any civil sanction authorized by law which is warranted by the facts of the committed offense.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-605\n\nAct 89, Session Laws 1975, amended this section by adding subsection (1)(e), empowering the court to order the convicted person to make restitution to the victim of the crime. The purpose of this change was to repay the victim for loss and develop in the convicted person \"...a degree of self-respect and pride in knowing that he or she has righted the wrong committed.\" Senate Standing Committee Report No. 789, House Standing Committee Report No. 425.\n\nAct 96, Session Laws 1978, added subsection (1)(f) to provide an alternative sentence for convicted persons for whom fines or imprisonment may not be deemed appropriate and to remove any doubt as to the authority of the court to impose a sentence requiring community service. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 974-78, House Standing Committee Report No. 586-78.\n\nAct 93, Session Laws 1980, amended subsection (2) to make it clear that the courts have the authority to sentence persons convicted of violations to perform community service. House Standing Committee Report No. 131-80. The Act also substituted sex-neutral words for gender-based terms.\n\nAct 100, Session Laws 1990, amended subsection (1)(e) to require mandatory screening for persons sentenced to perform community service to reduce instances of inappropriate placements which jeopardize the safety of the agency, the public, or the offender. House Standing Committee Report No. 1191-90.\n\nAct 215, Session Laws 1995, amended subsection (1) to authorize the court to order a convicted defendant to pay restitution to the criminal injuries compensation commission if the victim of the crime has been granted a compensation award by the commission. Prior to the amendment, the law was unclear as to whether the court had authority to order that restitution be paid directly to the criminal injuries compensation commission. The amendment also will provide additional revenues for the criminal injuries compensation commission, thus allowing the commission to compensate victims promptly for losses. The legislature found it \"appropriate and fiscally responsible\" to require a convicted criminal to reimburse the commission when the commission granted an award to the crime victim. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1356.\n\nAct 206, Session Laws 1998, amended this section to, among other things, require the imposition of a fee against convicted criminals. The monetary assessment of convicted criminal defendants is to fund disbursements made by the criminal injuries compensation commission. The legislature found that state compensation of victims of criminal acts is well-founded in public policy and is the law in every state of the Union. The legislature also found that thirty-four states administered compensation programs that were financially self-sufficient and funded from fees, fines, penalties, civil recoveries, and/or restitution. Adoption of such a program would be prudent and consistent with the legislature's objective of cutting government costs, considering the State's economic situation. Conference Committee Report No. 156.\n\nAct 240, Session Laws 1998, amended this section by changing the name of the criminal injuries compensation commission to the crime victim compensation commission. The legislature found that the purpose of the criminal injuries compensation commission is to aid victims of crime by providing them compensation for their victimization, and further, that the change would more clearly reflect the purpose of the commission to the public. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 726.\n\nAct 269, Session Laws 1998, amended this section to allow victims of crime to enforce a criminal restitution order in the same manner as a civil judgment. Conference Committee Report No. 89.\n\nAct 144, Session Laws 2005, amended this section by establishing the order of priority for a defendant to make payments in addition to the compensation fee. The priority schedule ensures that the victim of a defendant's crime receives the first amount of compensation paid by the defendant. Conference Committee Report No. 161, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1210.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among other things, require that when restitution is ordered, the amount of restitution is not based on the defendant's financial ability to make restitution, but the defendant's financial ability to make restitution shall be considered in establishing the time and manner of payment. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (6) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 43, Session Laws 2022, made conforming amendments to this section to allow convicted defendants to be sentenced to undergo domestic violence programs pursuant to applicable law, with or without probation. These conforming amendments facilitated other amendments made by Act 43 clarifying that a court is required to impose a sentence for domestic violence intervention, with or without probation, for violations of restraining orders, orders for protection, and abuse of family or household members. The legislature found that §586-4 authorizes a family court to order a violator of a temporary restraining order to undergo mandatory domestic violence intervention. However, the legislature found that the Hawaii Supreme Court misinterpreted §586-4(e) by holding that domestic violence intervention may only be ordered as a condition of probation. The legislature noted that domestic violence intervention, which includes anger management and domestic violence treatment, is an important part of addressing the root causes of domestic violence. Act 43 highlighted the importance of domestic violence intervention and clarified legislative intent by clearly mandating domestic violence intervention regardless of whether persons are sentenced with or without probation for violations of restraining orders, orders for protection, or abuse of family or household members.

Defendant could have been sentenced to a thirty-day term of incarceration or a six-month term of probation, but not both, and thus defendant's sentence was illegal. 130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033 (2013).\n\n§706-605 Commentary:\n\n1.

The legislature revised §706-606 and added the provision for mandatory life imprisonment without parole (but subject to commutation) now contained in subsection (a). The following commentary is based on the original proposal.]\n\nThe crime of murder is the most serious offense in the penal law; because of this the Code departs from the general policy underlying §706-605 and makes murder a non-probationable offense in all cases.\n\nThe flexible mode of disposition provided by §706-605 is premised on the rationale that, although most class A felons will, perhaps, be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment, no legislative classification can take account of unusual circumstances or extreme mitigations which would indicate that a sentence to probation, rather than to imprisonment, is warranted. The case is even stronger for defendants convicted of less serious offenses. However, in providing a bar to probation for persons convicted of murder (i.e., intentionally or knowingly causing the death of another person), the Code takes the position that, regardless of the information obtained by pre-sentence procedure, the court's options ought to be limited to which maximum, life or twenty years, will be applicable to the convicted defendant's term of imprisonment. The actual time of release from imprisonment will then be determined by the board of paroles and pardons, which will have more time and resources to devote to a more deliberate determination of the defendant's fitness to return to open society.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-606\n\nWhen the legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it revised §706-606 to provide for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in the four enumerated cases specified in subsection (a). However, the legislature provided that upon the Governor's commutation, parole would be possible at the end of twenty years of imprisonment. Subsection (b) essentially derived from the Proposed Draft.\n\nThe Conference Committee Report specifically provides that: \"It is the intent of your Committee that the term 'peace officer' [see subsection (a)(i)] includes judges and prosecuting attorneys. It is also the intent of your Committee that §701-101 of the Penal Code shall apply to prisoners presently serving sentences of life without parole who are, after twenty years of imprisonment, subject to the same review as provided in §706-606.\" Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\nAct 27, Session Laws 1981, eliminated the court's discretion under subsection (b) to impose a sentence of either life imprisonment with possibility of parole or twenty years imprisonment. As amended the subsection requires the court to impose the same indeterminate sentence in all cases.\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, deleted the provisions concerning sentencing for murder and replaced it with criteria to be considered by a court in imposing any sentence, including the need to afford deterrence to criminal conduct and to impose just punishment.

Hussein, and to the extent doing so constituted error by the ICA, the error did not warrant vacating defendant's convictions. 131 H. 94, 315 P.3d 720 (2013).\n\nSeven-day term of imprisonment was not unreasonably related to factors set forth in this section, considering nature of offense and circumstances presented by the record. 10 H. App. 381, 876 P.2d 1331 (1994).\n\nTrial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment under §706-668.5 where, taking into consideration all of the factors set forth in this section, the court pointed to the high level of cruelty, violence, and viciousness involved in the commission of the offenses, that most of the offenses took place in front of defendant's two-year-old son, defendant's lack of remorse, the clear and present danger defendant posed to complainant and the community, and the poor prospects for defendant's rehabilitation. 106 H. 365 (App.), 105 P.3d 242 (2004).\n\nWhere trial court's rationale for imposing jail time reflected the factors listed in this section, and the jail time imposed did not exceed the maximum jail term authorized by §706-663, trial court did not clearly exceed the bounds of reason nor disregard rules or principles of law or practice to defendant's substantial detriment in imposing a jail term; thus, trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to 120 days' imprisonment. 116 H. 403 (App.), 173 P.3d 550 (2007).\n\nFamily court did not abuse its discretion by requiring defendant to attend domestic violence counseling as a condition of defendant's probation; where defendant was charged with endangering the welfare of an incompetent person under §709-905 based on substantial evidence that defendant assaulted complainant, under §706-624(2), the court was free to impose discretionary conditions of probation that are reasonably related to the factors set forth in this section and to the extent that the conditions involve only deprivations of liberty as are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in paragraph (2). 121 H. 228 (App.), 216 P.3d 1251 (2009).\n\nCourt did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment under §706-668.5 because it considered the factors set forth in this section; defendant's extensive record and the fact that defendant caused a lot of harm in the community were specific circumstances that led the court to conclude that a consecutive sentence was appropriate. 129 H. 135 (App.), 295 P.3d 1005 (2013).\n\nIn light of prosecutor's strong emphasis in sentencing arguments on defendant's Micronesian heritage and the need to send a message to the Micronesian community, the circuit court was required to take more definitive action to dispel the appearance that the prosecutor's improper arguments may have played a role in determining defendant's sentence; sentences vacated and resentencing to be handled by a different judge. 134 H. 289 (App.), 339 P.3d 1090 (2014).\n\nCited: 73 H. 81, 829 P.2d 1325 (1992).\n\nDiscussed: 78 H. 127, 890 P.2d 1167 (1995); 81 H. 421 (App.), 918 P.2d 228 (1996).",

The court lacked guidance as to the costs the court could require an arsonist to pay for starting a brush fire.

If the prosecuting authority determines that it is appropriate to provide notice of the expedited sentencing program to the defendant, the police department or other appropriate investigative law enforcement agency shall give the defendant written notice of the existence of the expedited sentencing program provided in this section.

Upon completion of this investigation, if there is sufficient basis to believe that you have committed a sexual assault, the case will be referred to the appropriate prosecuting authority for review and possible institution of criminal charges. Hawaii law provides for a range of ordinary prison sentences for felony sexual assault ranging from five years up to twenty years, or life imprisonment, depending upon the offense. However, section 706-606.3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, provides that a person who commits a sexual assault upon a minor but who admits guilt, cooperates with the prosecuting authority, and participates in appropriate assessment and treatment may be considered for the expedited sentencing program. A person who is sentenced in accordance with the expedited sentencing program may be sentenced to a term of probation. Probation may be revoked, however, for failure to comply with the terms of the probation pursuant to section 706-625. To qualify for consideration for the expedited sentencing program, your legal counsel first must request from the office of the prosecuting authority named in this notice a written statement as to whether that office has any objection to your being considered for the expedited sentencing program. THE COURT WILL NOT CONSIDER YOU FOR THE EXPEDITED SENTENCING PROGRAM UNDER SECTION 706-606.3, HAWAII REVISED STATUTES, UNLESS YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL HAS RECEIVED A WRITTEN STATEMENT THAT THE APPROPRIATE PROSECUTING AUTHORITY HAS NO OBJECTION TO YOUR BEING CONSIDERED FOR THE EXPEDITED SENTENCING PROGRAM AND THE REQUEST FOR THAT WRITTEN STATEMENT WAS MADE WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OF YOUR RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE. FURTHER, THE COURT WILL NOT CONSIDER YOU FOR THE EXPEDITED SENTENCING PROGRAM UNDER SECTION 706-606.3, HAWAII REVISED STATUTES, UNLESS, ONCE YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL HAS RECEIVED THIS NOTICE, YOU HAVE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO AVOID THE NECESSITY OF THE CHILD BEING REMOVED FROM THE FAMILY HOME, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MOVING AND REMAINING OUT OF THE FAMILY HOME UNTIL OTHERWISE ORDERED BY THE COURT.\"\n\nThe written notice also shall provide:\n\n(a) Instructions on how to contact the appropriate prosecuting authority, including any necessary addresses and telephone numbers; and\n\n(b) The name of the person delivering the notice and the date it was given to the alleged offender.\n\n(4) A defendant shall not be considered by the court for the expedited sentencing program under this section unless the defendant's legal counsel requests within fourteen days of the defendant's receipt of the written notice, that the defendant be considered for the expedited sentencing program, and defendant's counsel subsequently receives a written statement from the appropriate prosecuting authority stating that it has no objection to the defendant being considered for the expedited sentencing program in accordance with this section. Additionally, each of the following criteria shall be met:\n\n(a) After receiving the required written notice, the defendant made a good faith effort to avoid the necessity of the child being removed from the family home, including but not limited to moving and remaining out of the family home until otherwise ordered by the court;\n\n(b) The victim of the sexual assault was under the age of eighteen when the sexual assault was committed;\n\n(c) The defendant was never previously sentenced under this section and has never been convicted of felony sexual assault under section 707-730, 707-731, or 707-732, or incest under section 707-741;\n\n(d) A guardian ad litem appointed in a family court proceeding, or a person assigned by the Children's Advocacy Center to serve as guardian ad litem, agreed that it would be in the best interest of the child for the defendant to be considered for the expedited sentencing program. No prosecuting authority shall issue a statement of no objection without this prior agreement; and\n\n(e) The defendant has complied with the requirements for consideration for the expedited sentencing program as established in subsection (6); provided that at sentencing the prosecuting authority may oppose the defendant's participation in the expedited sentencing program if the prosecuting authority determines that the defendant has failed to satisfy the criteria under subsection (6).\n\n(5) The prosecuting authority and the child's guardian ad litem may consult with any other appropriate agency or individual to assist in a decision whether to provide a written statement of \"no objection\" prior to the defendant being considered for sentencing under the expedited sentencing program.\n\n(6) Within seven business days of receipt of the written notice stating that the appropriate prosecuting authority has no objection to the defendant being considered for the expedited sentencing program in accordance with this section, unless the prosecuting authority waives compliance with the time limit, the defendant shall:\n\n(a) Continue to make a good faith effort to avoid the necessity of the child being removed from the family home, including but not limited to moving and remaining out of the family home until otherwise ordered by the court;\n\n(b) Admit to commission of the sexual assault to the police department of the county in which the assault took place or other appropriate investigative law enforcement agency;\n\n(c) Provide to the appropriate prosecuting authority a written waiver of indictment and preliminary hearing for any criminal charges arising from the sexual assault; and\n\n(d) Enter a voluntary plea of guilty to the charge or charges alleged upon or following arraignment.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding sections 706-606.5, 706-620, 706-659, 706-660, and 706-660.2, a defendant considered for the expedited sentencing program under this section when sentence is imposed may be sentenced to a term of probation pursuant to section 706-624; provided that if the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment as a condition of probation, the term of imprisonment may allow for the defendant's retention of employment.\n\n(8) The term of probation under this section shall be as follows:\n\n(a) For an offense under section 707-730 or 707-731, twenty years; and\n\n(b) For an offense under section 707-732 or 707-741, ten years.\n\n(9) In addition to the conditions of probation provided under section 706-624, a sentence under this section shall include that the defendant shall:\n\n(a) Participate in court approved, appropriate sex offender assessment and treatment that shall conform to the guidelines developed by the adult probation division of the appropriate circuit court, until clinically discharged; provided that:\n\n(i) The prosecuting authority shall be provided notice and the opportunity for a hearing prior to any authorization for treatment discontinuance by the court or the adult probation division;\n\n(ii) The defendant shall pay for the cost of the assessment and treatment to the extent that the defendant has the ability to do so; and\n\n(iii) A lack of assessment and treatment resources shall result in the defendant not being considered for the expedited sentencing program;\n\n(b) Provide a written waiver of confidentiality for any assessment, treatment, counseling, therapy, or other program ordered as a condition of probation;\n\n(c) Comply with all orders entered in a proceeding pursuant to chapter 587A; and\n\n(d) Comply with other condition deemed by the court to be reasonably necessary for the protection of the victim of the sexual assault or the rehabilitation of the defendant.\n\n(10) There shall be a rebuttable presumption in favor of the court imposing a sentence in accordance with this section when a defendant qualifies for the expedited sentencing program, and written notice of \"no objection\" is issued by the prosecuting authority. The court shall provide written findings of fact setting forth specific reasons justifying imposition of a sentence that is not in accordance with this section.

The legislature found that this section offers a new approach to removing obstacles that delay and hinder the successful prosecution of certain sex offenders, offers prosecutors an option to encourage offenders to plead guilty and accept treatment early in the proceedings, and offers hope that treatment and intensive monitoring will minimize the chance of further abuse. The intent is to accomplish an increase in criminal convictions, punishment, and deterrence, while providing better protection for potential victims, not only from sexual assault but from the trauma of being the primary witness against a family member. House Standing Committee Report No. 1174, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 849.\n\nAct 157, Session Laws 1995, extended the sunset date of this section from June 30, 1995 to June 30, 2001. The legislature found that the expedited sentencing program served as \"a viable alternative in a small number of select cases\" and that the program should continue to be available within the criminal justice system. However, the legislature believed that there was insufficient basis to determine whether the program should be made permanent. Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\nAct 127, Session Laws 2001, repealed the sunset date for the expedited sentencing program of the family court. The purpose of the program was to allow for the expeditious removal of the offender from the family home, in cases of intra-family felony sexual assault or incest, thus allowing the child to remain in the home. The legislature found that the program applied only to those offenders found to be \"safe to probate\" and minimized the possibility of revictimizing the child by eliminating the need to testify and requiring treatment and supervision of all members of the child's family. The legislature further found that the program had been effective and beneficial to the families concerned. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1453, Conference Committee Report No. 114.\n\nAct 135, Session Laws 2010, created a new Child Protective Act [chapter 587A] to make paramount the safety and health of children who have been harmed or are in life circumstances that threaten harm, and to ensure that the Child Protective Act was in conformity with Federal Title IV-E provisions. Conference Committee Report No. 112-10. Act 135 amended this section by replacing the reference to chapter 587 with a reference to the new chapter.",

      "text": "§706-606.4 Sentencing in enumerated offenses committed in the presence of a minor.(1) In addition to the factors considered under section 706-606, the court shall consider the following aggravating factors in determining the particular sentence to be imposed:\n\n(a) The defendant has been convicted of committing or attempting to commit an offense; and\n\n(b) The offense contemporaneously occurred in the presence of a minor.\n\n(2) As used in this section:\n\n\"In the presence of a minor\" means in the actual physical presence of a child or knowing that a child is present and may hear or see the offense.\n\n\"Offense\" means a violation of section 707-710 (assault in the first degree), 707-711 (assault in the second degree), 707-730 (sexual assault in the first degree), 707-731 (sexual assault in the second degree), 707-732 (sexual assault in the third degree), 709-906 (abuse of family or household members), or 711-1109.8 (sexual assault of an animal). [L 1999, c 268, §2; am L 2003, c 3, §16; am L 2016, c 157, §1; am L 2021, c 31, §3]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-606.4\n\nAct 268, Session Laws 1999, added this section to require judges, when imposing a sentence, to consider the fact that the crime was committed in the presence of a minor as an aggravating factor of the crime; the court shall consider the aggravating factors in addition to the factors to be considered under §706-606. The legislature found that children who witness domestic violence are harmed in many ways, and acknowledged that domestic violence is a perpetuation of a violent cycle, as children of abuse grow up to be abusers themselves. Studies have documented multiple problems among children that have witnessed continual assaults by one parent on another in the home, including psychological and emotional distress, cognitive functioning problems, and physical problems. Because of the high social and financial costs resulting from domestic violence, the legislature agreed that more serious penalties should be imposed for both their deterrent and punitive effects. Conference Committee Report No. 26.\n\nAct 3, Session Laws 2003, made a technical amendment to this section, by deleting the brackets around the word \"or\" in the phrase \"abuse of family or household members.\"\n\nAct 157, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to provide that the commission of certain offenses of assault, sexual assault, and abuse of a family or household member in the presence of a minor is an aggravating factor to be considered in the sentencing of the defendant convicted of the offense. The legislature found that research has shown that children who witness assault or domestic violence can suffer severe emotional and developmental difficulties that are similar to those of children who are victims of direct physical and mental abuse. By broadening the application of the aggravating factor considered by the courts when sentencing defendants convicted of committing certain crimes in the presence of a minor pursuant to this section to include the commission of assault and sexual assault offenses regardless of the preexisting legal relationship between the defendant and the victim or the child, Act 157 recognized the impact that witnessing an assault has on a child. The use of the aggravating factor for sentencing does not elevate the seriousness of the offense charged. Conference Committee Report No. 13-16.\n\nAct 31, Session Laws 2021, amended this section to provide that the commission or attempted commission of the offense of sexual assault of an animal in the presence of a minor is an aggravating factor to be considered in the sentencing of the defendant convicted of the offense. The legislature found that sexual assault of an animal has been significantly linked to the sexual abuse of children as well as interpersonal violence and other forms of animal cruelty. In addition, sexual abusers of animals have been shown to collect and share child pornography and express interest in other aberrant behavior involving sexual violence and fetish behaviors. The legislature further found that although Hawaii had strong animal cruelty laws, some acts of sexual assault on animals could not be prosecuted under those laws because the acts did not cause bodily injury. Establishing sexual assault of an animal as a separate crime would allow law enforcement officers to better identify potentially dangerous and violent sexual predators in the community. The legislature noted that the high penalties for the offense of sexual assault of an animal were intended not just to protect animals but also to be a deterrent against the sexual assault of children because animal abuse is often a precursor to child abuse.

Finding a clear danger to the people of Hawaii in the high incidence of offenses being committed by repeat offenders, the legislature felt it necessary to provide for mandatory terms of imprisonment without possibility of parole in cases of repeated offenses by prior offenders. House Conference Committee Report No. 32, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 33.\n\nAct 98, Session Laws 1979, amended this section to provide that persons convicted of any of the crimes enumerated be punished as repeat offenders if they are subsequently convicted of any of the enumerated offenses within the time of the maximum sentence of the prior conviction. Under the prior law, a person had to be convicted of the same enumerated crime on more than one occasion. The legislature felt this amendment was needed to alleviate concerns that the repeat offender problem be dealt with seriously. Conference Committee Report No. 11.\n\nAct 284, Session Laws 1980, completely revised this section. It expanded the list of offenses carrying the possibility of mandatory minimum sentences and divided the offenses into the two classes enumerated in subsections (1) and (2). Further, it introduced a degree of flexibility into the sentencing procedure by allowing the court, upon written opinion, to set a lesser minimum sentence than that prescribed if there were strong mitigating circumstances to warrant such action.\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, amended the repeat offender law so that mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment are increased as the severity of the repeat offense increases. Thus, the mandatory minimum term for a class A repeat offender is greater than that term for a class B repeat offender. The period of time during which a felon is considered to have a prior felony conviction is dependent on the seriousness of the prior felony; the more severe the prior crime, the longer it remains a prior conviction.\n\nOnly certain class C felonies were made subject to the repeat offender law since the legislature intended to have some latitude as to which of those crimes should fall within the repeat offender category. Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\nAct 181, Session Laws 1987, added felony convictions of another jurisdiction to the list of crimes (\"prior felonies\") which are considered in the sentencing of repeat offenders. The Act also added, to the list of applicable periods, that the period within which the repeat offender statute applies is the maximum possible prison term of the prior felony conviction of another jurisdiction. The Act repealed subsection (4)(a) to clarify that this section requires only one felony conviction prior to the felony for which the defendant is sentenced pursuant to this section. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1130.\n\nAct 87, Session Laws 1996, added the crime of unauthorized control of propelled vehicle to the class C felonies subject to repeat offender sentencing. The legislature found that vehicle thefts and property taken from the vehicles was a serious problem in the State, and that this kind of theft affected a significant number of visitors and residents. The Act also amended the section to prohibit the parole of repeat offenders prior to the expiration of their mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2598.\n\nAct 277, Session Laws 1997, amended this section by including the offense of trademark counterfeiting in the list of offenses for repeat offenders. The legislature found that trademark counterfeiting was a recurring problem in Hawaii for retail boutiques and trademark products of the University of Hawaii, and that tourists are often the target for the scams. The legislature believed that the Act would safeguard not only consumers from the sale of counterfeit products, but would also protect the reputation and quality of trademarks and ensure that trademarks are used for their legitimate and intended purposes. House Standing Committee Report No. 1620, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 759.\n\nAct 195, Session Laws 1999, amended this section to include §188-23 as an offense subject to repeat offender sentencing. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1487.\n\nAct 244, Session Laws 1999, amended this section by, among other things, providing: (1) that the multiple offender of assault in the third degree, terroristic threatening in the second degree, sexual assault in the fourth degree, criminal property damage in the third degree, theft in the third degree, or misdemeanor shoplifting, shall be sentenced to no less than nine months of imprisonment in cases where a person is convicted on at least three prior and separate occasions of any of the specified misdemeanor offenses within a three-year period; and (2) that the court shall order a defendant sentenced under §707-733, relating to sexual assault in the fourth degree, to participate in a sex offender assessment and participate in the sex offender treatment program, if necessary and appropriate.\n\nThe legislature found that there are many criminals who repeatedly commit misdemeanor offenses; these persons know that under current law, if caught, the consequences of their conduct will be relatively minor. As such, there is currently no serious deterrent to their repeated criminal behavior. A mandatory sentence will send a strong message that repeated criminal behavior will not be tolerated. Conference Committee Report No. 42, House Standing Committee Report No. 1466.\n\nAct 80, Session Laws 2006, added electronic enticement of a child in the second degree to the list of class C felonies subject to repeat offender sentencing. Act 80 provided a means to ensure the safety of Hawaii's children, enhance enforcement efforts, and impose significant penalties against those who prey on the most vulnerable members of the community. Conference Committee Report No. 10-06, House Standing Committee Report No. 1520-06.\n\nAct 139, Session Laws 2006, increased the protection of personal information by providing for repeat felony offender sentencing of offenders with prior felony convictions who are convicted of unauthorized possession of confidential personal information or of identity theft in the third degree. Hawaii law enforcement has found it difficult to curb the rise in identity theft-related crimes when identity thieves in possession of personal information who have not yet caused a monetary loss to the victim cannot be prosecuted for crimes other than petty misdemeanor thefts. The legislature found that increasing the penalties for identity theft by amending the law to make identity theft an enumerated offense within the repeat offender statute would help to deter identity theft crimes. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2636, House Standing Committee Report No. 1295-06.\n\nAct 49, Session Laws 2007, amended this section to deter insurance fraud by including felony insurance fraud relating to workers' compensation, accident and health or sickness, and motor vehicle insurance, and insurance provided by mutual benefit societies and health maintenance organizations, among the offenses subject to repeat felony offender sentencing. The legislature found that while insurance [fraud] is often perceived as a nonviolent and victimless crime, the ramifications of insurance fraud affect everyone through higher insurance premiums. House Standing Committee Report No. 913, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1589.\n\nAct 80, Session Laws 2008, amended subsection (1) by including the offense of failure to comply with covered offender registration requirements. Conference Committee Report No. 82-08.\n\nAct 149, Session Laws 2009, which amended subsection (1), established an insurance fraud investigations branch to replace the insurance fraud investigations unit, with expanded authority to prevent, investigate, and prosecute insurance fraud to include all lines of insurance except workers' compensation. Act 149 also established criminal and administrative penalties for insurance fraud in all covered lines of insurance and for different types of insurance fraud. The legislature found that because insurance fraud occurs in every line of insurance, the State's insurance fraud law should be expanded accordingly. Conference Committee Report No. 26, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1338.\n\nAct 114, Session Laws 2014, amended this section by, among other things, deleting the conviction of theft in the first degree and promoting prostitution in the second degree from the class C felony offenses enumerated in this section. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3249, Conference Committee Report No. 41-14.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 18, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to add the class C felony offenses of abuse of family or household members to the list of felonies that qualify for repeat offender sentencing. The legislature found that this section was first enacted in 1976 to provide specialized sentencing provisions for repeat felony offenses and had been amended a number of times to include various class C felonies. Although this list covered a range of very serious crimes, one violent class C felony that was missing from this list was felony-level abuse of a family or household member under §709-906(8), (9), and (10). Given that class C felony offenses had been added to this section piecemeal over the years, the legislature believed that the exclusion of felony-level abuse of a family or household member from this list was not intentional, but rather an oversight, as the provisions of §709-906(8), (9), and (10) were created long after the sentencing for repeat offenders statute was enacted in 1976, and also long after the offense of abuse of a family or household member was enacted in 1973. Until 1999, abuse of a family or household member was only classified as a misdemeanor offense. The legislature found that the heightened penalties for repeat felony offenders would more accurately reflect the seriousness of these types of offenses in today's society by placing abuse of a family or household member on the same level as all other violent class C felonies, promote greater protection and safety for victims and families of domestic violence, and ensure accountability for offenders. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2719, House Standing Committee Report No. 1838-22.\n\nActs 53 and 109, Session Laws 2022, amended subsection (1) to update the name of the offense established by §708-836 to \"unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle in the first degree.\"\n\nAct 111, Session Laws 2022, amended the list of class C felonies in subsection (1) to repeal the reference to the offense of promoting gambling in the first degree to reflect the amendment in Act 111 elevating that offense to a class B felony.\n\nNot applicable to defendant who had no prior conviction for any offense for which now charged. 800 F.2d 861 (1986).\n\nWhere defendant contended, inter alia, that federal sentencing guidelines preempted use of Hawaii repeat offender statute, defendant's conviction was subject to the statute, which applied to offenses committed on federal enclaves; district court did not err in applying the statute. 105 F.3d 463 (1997).\n\n\"Prior conviction\" includes convictions which occurred before the effective date of statute. 61 H. 262, 602 P.2d 914 (1979).\n\nSentencing under section--procedural requirements. 61 H. 262, 602 P.2d 914 (1979).\n\nStatute as it applies to burglary in the first degree is not unconstitutional as violative of the cruel and unusual punishment, equal protection, due process, or ex post facto clauses. 61 H. 262, 602 P.2d 914 (1979).\n\nProof of legal representation. 61 H. 281, 602 P.2d 927 (1979).\n\nSufficiency of evidence of prior conviction. 61 H. 281, 602 P.2d 927 (1979).\n\nMandatory minimum sentence for repeat offenders of §712-1242 not constitutionally proscribed. 61 H. 285, 602 P.2d 930 (1979).\n\nRequirement of notice of intended application of section. 61 H. 285, 602 P.2d 930 (1979).\n\nState must show defendant was represented by counsel at prior conviction or had waived such representation. 61 H. 285, 602 P.2d 930 (1979).\n\nConviction on multiple counts considered as one prior conviction. 63 H. 509, 630 P.2d 633 (1981).\n\nLesser mandatory minimum sentence under subsection (3) may be imposed for persons convicted prior to effective date of 1980 amendment but sentenced after it. 64 H. 210, 638 P.2d 319 (1981).\n\nNot ambiguous. 66 H. 182, 658 P.2d 882 (1983).\n\nSection does not apply to attempted felonies. 67 H. 476, 691 P.2d 1169 (1984).\n\nSentence is illegal if not imposed on repeat offender in compliance with statute's requirements. 67 H. 531, 696 P.2d 344 (1985).\n\nMandatory minimum sentence may not run consecutively to sentence for underlying conviction. 67 H. 616, 699 P.2d 988 (1985).\n\n\"Conviction\" refers to judgment entered upon finding of guilt. Two sentences on the same day for separate offenses charged in two indictments are two convictions. 68 H. 124, 706 P.2d 1293 (1985).\n\nDefendant's prior four-year sentence as young adult is the \"maximum sentence of the prior conviction\". 68 H. 169, 706 P.2d 1304 (1985).\n\nDefendant's two prior convictions did not merge into one prior conviction. 71 H. 153, 785 P.2d 1314 (1990).\n\nA sentencing court may order that a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment imposed under §706-660.1 be served consecutively to a mandatory period of imprisonment imposed under this section in connection with a separate felony conviction arising out of a charge contained in the same indictment or complaint. 84 H. 476, 935 P.2d 1021 (1997).\n\nSection divests sentencing court of authority to impose consecutive mandatory minimum periods of imprisonment on a defendant convicted of multiple felony counts charged in the same indictment or complaint. 84 H. 476, 935 P.2d 1021 (1997).\n\nTrial court's refusal to find strong mitigating circumstances pursuant to subsection (4) (1998) and imposition of concurrent mandatory minimum ten-year terms not unconstitutional where defendant could have reasonably been deemed to pose a danger to society, more serious crimes by repeat offenders may be punished in Hawaii by longer mandatory minimum terms, and other jurisdictions permitted significantly lengthier sentences for repeat offenders. 93 H. 87, 997 P.2d 13 (2000).\n\nInasmuch as the plain and unambiguous language of this section requires application of the repeat offender statute over \"any other law to the contrary\", the circuit court did not err in sentencing defendant as a repeat offender pursuant to this section; in all cases in which this section is applicable, including those in which a defendant would otherwise be eligible for probation under §706-622.5, the circuit courts must sentence defendants pursuant to the provisions of this section. 103 H. 228, 81 P.3d 408 (2003).\n\nBy its plain language, Act 44, L 2004, prospectively permitted greater discretion to sentencing courts confronted with conflicts between this section and §706-622.5 than they previously possessed; thus, based on the legislative intent reflected in Act 44, the Act 161, L 2002 version of §706-622.5, under which defendant was sentenced, did not trump the repeat offender statute. 106 H. 1, 100 P.3d 595 (2004).\n\nTrial court properly sentenced defendant as a repeat offender based on defendant's conviction of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree under §712-1243, an enumerated class C felony under this section. 106 H. 146, 102 P.3d 1044 (2004).\n\nA defendant is entitled, by timely HRPP rule 35 motion to correct sentence or by HRPP rule 40 petition, to move for correction of an enhanced sentence once the defendant has successfully attacked a prior conviction on which the sentence was based in whole or part because that conviction no longer constitutes a proper basis for increased punishment for a subsequent offense under this section. 109 H. 458, 128 P.3d 340 (2006).\n\nWhere defendant was a convicted felon subject to a mandatory minimum sentence for a repeat offense as of the date the judgment was entered, the trial court properly relied on the prior conviction in sentencing defendant because the prior conviction had not been vacated at the time of sentencing. 109 H. 458, 128 P.3d 340 (2006).\n\nBecause defendant was charged on January 5 and April 13, 2004, prior to L 2004, Act 44's effective date of July 1, 2004, the trial court erred in applying Act 44's ameliorative amendments to defendant's sentence by failing to observe the statutory command of Act 44, §29; thus, as defendant conceded that defendant qualified as a repeat offender under this section in light of a prior conviction of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle, the trial court was required to apply this section to sentence defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence of one year and eight months. 115 H. 79, 165 P.3d 980 (2007).\n\nBy virtue of the directive \"notwithstanding ... any other law\" present in this section, where mandatory minimum terms are imposed consecutively in the discretion of the court, indeterminate maximum sentences must also run consecutively despite §706-668 (repealed 1986) because mandatory minimums are part of, and incorporated within, the period or term of the indeterminate maximum sentence involved, and indeterminate maximum terms must run consecutively in order for the mandatory minimum sentence to be imposed consecutively as permitted by this section. 118 H. 210, 188 P.3d 724 (2008).\n\nIn considering how the term \"maximum term of imprisonment possible\" in subsection (2)(f) should be applied to sentencing schemes that do not fit the Hawaii mold, the words of the statute should be strictly applied, with the focus on \"terms of imprisonment\"; thus, appellate court erred in interpreting the mandatory parole term required by Colorado law to be served after the term of imprisonment as part of the \"maximum term of imprisonment possible\", even though reincarceration could subject a parolee to additional time in prison. 118 H. 425, 193 P.3d 341 (2008).\n\nThe term \"maximum term of imprisonment possible\" in subsection (2)(f) refers to the maximum term of imprisonment to which a court in a foreign jurisdiction may possibly sentence a convicted defendant. 118 H. 425, 193 P.3d 341 (2008).\n\nWhere, in light of defendant's stipulation, the combined evidence should have \"reasonably satisfied\" the trial court as to the prior conviction and its sentence date, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to accord the evidence its proper weight; thus, because defendant committed the promoting a dangerous drug offense within the \"maximum term of imprisonment possible\" after defendant's Colorado conviction, which was six years, application of the mandatory minimum term under subsection (2)(f) was appropriate. 118 H. 425, 193 P.3d 341 (2008).\n\nA sentencing judge may consider imposing a defendant's mandatory minimum sentence consecutively to the shortest of any sentence previously imposed. 122 H. 495, 229 P.3d 313 (2010).\n\nImposing a prison sentence consecutively to \"any sentence\" pursuant to subsection (5), including the lesser of such sentences, is a novel, but accurate view of the statute; thus, henceforth, the circuit court must state on the record its reasons for imposing a consecutive as opposed to a concurrent sentence under §706-668.5 or this section. 122 H. 495, 229 P.3d 313 (2010).\n\nA defendant is entitled to have a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant €™s prior convictions trigger the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence as a repeat offender under this section. 136 H. 244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015).\n\nAs mandatory minimum sentencing for repeat offenders under this section \"enhanc[es] the penalty of the crime committed\", constitutional requirements of due process and criminal charging require that defendant's predicate prior convictions be alleged in the charging instrument. 136 H. 244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015).\n\nIn determining voluntariness of guilty plea, judge should have established that petitioner was aware of mandatory minimum sentence to same extent as petitioner's awareness of maximum sentence. 9 H. App. 122, 826 P.2d 440 (1992).\n\nNo merit to defendant's points on appeal that contended that: (1) circuit court violated right to due process when it assumed role of prosecutor and attempted to establish a record on which to base a minimum mandatory sentence; and (2) imposition of mandatory minimum sentence was unauthorized because circuit court's finding that defendant had prior felony conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence. 9 H. App. 583, 854 P.2d 238 (1993).\n\nTrial court did not err in granting the State's motion for sentencing of repeat offender and ordering that defendant was subject to the repeat offender sentencing provisions of this section where defendant committed the offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the second degree within the maximum term of imprisonment possible after defendant's conviction in federal district court and the maximum term of imprisonment came from the United States Code. 125 H. 497 (App.), 264 P.3d 676 (2011).",

The order of involuntary hospitalization may be made after conviction, in which event the court may set aside the verdict or judgment of conviction and dismiss the prosecution.\n\n(2) The court shall not make an order under subsection (1) unless it is of the view that it will substantially further the rehabilitation of the defendant and will not jeopardize the protection of the public. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-607\n\nThis section extends the concept of involuntary hospitalization in the penal context beyond its classic use in cases of irresponsible defendants.[1] The section does not itself create the authority for the involuntary hospitalization of certain types of offenders, but rather it acknowledges that where the defendant is subject by law to involuntary hospitalization, the court may order the hospitalization in lieu of prosecution or sentence. In the terminology of the Model Penal Code:\n\nThis section does not authorize civil commitment in any case but rather pre-supposes that authority for the commitment is otherwise conferred by law. Only in that event is the commitment authorized in lieu of sentence.[2]\n\nThe Code allows the court, in its discretion, to order hospitalization in three limited situations: where a person prosecuted for a class C felony or lesser grade of crime is (1) a chronic alcoholic, (2) a narcotic addict, or (3) a person suffering from a mental abnormality not amounting to an excusing condition under chapter 704. The commitment in each case is to a medical institution for rehabilitative treatment.\n\nThe section is in accord with the trend of the law favoring medical and para-medical incarceration rather than incarceration which is largely, but not solely, punitive.[3]\n\nIt should be noted that the section is not restricted to crimes directly related to the defendant's physical or mental condition. Rather, the court is empowered to order hospitalization, if authorized by civil law, in cases where the crime is only tangentially related to the defendant's abnormality.\n\n...[W]hen the method of subjecting narcotic users to treatment is commitment, it makes small sense to deny that authority if the addict is not guilty of possession merely but has also committed a larceny, for example, to find the means for getting his supply.4\n\nThe same example might be used in the case of chronic alcoholics.\n\nSubsection (2) provides a statutory guideline for the exercise of judicial discretion. The court should, of course, refrain from ordering civil commitment unless such commitment will substantially further the rehabilitation of the defendant without jeopardizing the protection of the public.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that this section is not a self-executing one. It does not solve the difficult problem of determining in what cases of physical or mental illness or abnormality involuntary hospitalization ought to be authorized. The resolution of that question can only result from a complete reevaluation of the laws authorizing involuntary hospitalization.\n\n§706-607 Commentary:\n\n1. Cf. Chapter 704.\n\n2.

Such sanctions are obviously severe and should be reserved for cases involving (1) intentional and persistent misconduct, and (2) a need for public protection which cannot be otherwise met. However, \"persistent misconduct need not be restricted to prior convictions of the corporation or its agents for criminal offenses.\"1\n\nThe concentration of corporate wealth would tend to indicate that sanctions involving merely a fine may not be sufficient. However, although the Code authorizes forfeiture of the corporate charter and revocation of a foreign corporation's right to do business in the State, these sanctions are not automatic upon conviction or even a finding of persistent misconduct. Here, as in other areas, the Code provides a flexible approach by vesting discretion in the court.\n\nSubsection (3) provides that involuntary dissolution in a penal case shall follow procedures authorized by law for involuntary dissolution in a civil context.\n\nUnlike the Model Penal Code, which provides for institution of separate proceedings for forfeiture or revocation, this Code authorizes the sentencing court to decree forfeiture of a domestic corporate charter or revocation of a certificate of foreign corporation authorized to do business in this State. Unlike many jurisdictions in the United States, which the Model Penal Code was drafted to accommodate, criminal cases in Hawaii are not handled by courts of limited jurisdiction. The criminal calendar is rotated annually and neither lack of judicial expertise nor lack of judicial power would suggest that in Hawaii forfeiture or revocation should be handled by a separate court.\n\n§706-608 Commentary:\n\n1.

      "text": "§706-609 Resentence for the same offense or for offense based on the same conduct not to be more severe than prior sentence.When a conviction or sentence is set aside on direct or collateral attack, the court shall not impose a new sentence for the same offense, or for a different offense based on the same conduct, which is more severe than the prior sentence. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-609\n\nThis section is derived from the American Bar Association's Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures.[1] The section is self-explanatory. The reasons which compelled the American Bar Association Project to recommend this section have been well stated in the commentary to the Standards. We yield to the temptation to quote that commentary at length:\n\nThere are three reasons which have led the Advisory Committee to this view. The first relates to the selection process which leads to the possibility of an increased sentence. The only argument which can justify an increase following a re-trial is that the original sentence was too light, either because the first judge was too lenient or because new facts have been presented. However, the only class of persons who are vulnerable to this argument consists of those who have exercised the right to challenge their convictions. There is no basis for believing that there exists any rational correspondence between this group and those offenders who may indeed deserve an increase....\n\nThe second argument is closely related. The risk of a greater sentence as the result of the assertion of the right of review necessarily acts as a deterrent to the exercise of the right. The issue thus posed is whether this is a desirable result. The Advisory Committee believes that it is not. The extent of the pressure placed on an individual defendant bears no relation to the degree of injustice which may have been perpetrated. A system which fears the assertion of error to a degree that it must place artificial deterrents in the path which leads to review is not a healthy system. There can also be adverse effects on the rehabilitative effort of the individual defendant who believes that he was wronged but is told that he may have to subject himself to the possibility of a greater wrong in order to assert any error.\n\nThe third reason which leads the Advisory Committee to this view begins with the difficulties which a contrary position would invite. It is a matter of record that some judges have imposed harsher sentences because of lack of sympathy with the constitutional rights asserted by some defendants, and in a frank attempt to minimize the numbers who will assert such rights in the future. Yet it is at least clear that greater punishment should not be inflicted on the defendant because he has asserted his right to appeal. The only justification for an increased sentence, as noted above, is either that the first judge was too lenient or that new facts have been discovered. A position contrary to the standard proposed here would thus necessitate in every case a factual inquiry to determine the motivation of the judge who imposed the new sentence. As the Fourth Circuit recently pointed out, it is \"impossible, and most distasteful\" for other courts to be required to make that kind of inquiry. Patton v. North Carolina, 381 F.2d 636, 641 (4th Cir. 1967). If the system can avoid such a result at a cost which is not prohibitive, it most certainly should do so. In the Advisory Committee's view, the cost in this instance particularly in light of the other reasons advanced above is not significant.\n\nFinally, it should also be noted that there are substantial constitutional arguments which can be made against a practice contrary to the proposed standard.

      "text": "§706-610 Classes of felonies.(1) Apart from first and second degree murder and attempted first and second degree murder, felonies defined by this Code are classified, for the purpose of sentence, into three classes, as follows:\n\n(a) Class A felonies;\n\n(b) Class B felonies; and\n\n(c) Class C felonies.\n\nA felony is a class A, class B, or class C felony when it is so designated by this Code. Except for first and second degree murder and attempted first and second degree murder, a crime declared to be a felony, without specification of class, is a class C felony.\n\n(2) A felony defined by any statute of this State other than this Code shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a class C felony, except if another provision of law specifically defines a felony to be of a specified class as defined by this Code, such felony shall be treated for the purpose of sentence as provided by this chapter for that class of felony. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §19; am L 1987, c 181, §4]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-610\n\nThe chapter takes the general position that authorized sentences must take into consideration two things: (1) the seriousness of the crime, and (2) the character of the defendant. The Penal Code divides crime into three grades--felonies, misdemeanors, and petty misdemeanors--according to their seriousness. This section further subdivides felonies into three classes. With the exception of special provisions calling for the possibility of lifetime imprisonment for the offense of murder, the Code thus provides five categories of crimes \"which should exhaust the possibilities of reasonable, legislative discrimination.\"[1]\n\nThe prior Hawaii criminal law provided for two categories of crimes: felonies and misdemeanors.[2] However, within each category, the legislature had fixed a multitude of different sentences which are not necessarily consistent with one another or adequately correlated to the relative seriousness of the offense.[3]\n\nThe number and variety of the distinctions of this order found in most existing systems is one of the main causes of the anarchy in sentencing that is so widely deplored. Any effort to rationalize the situation must result in the reduction of distinctions to a relatively few important categories.[4]\n\nSubsection (2) reduces to a class C felony, those felonies defined by a statute not within this Code. This reflects the \"judgment that the [Penal] Code should deal at least with any area of criminality involving crimes so serious that classification as a [class A or class B] felony for sentence purposes is justified.\"5\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-610\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, amended this section so that non-Code statutes enacted since 1973 may designate felonies as class A or B felonies, rather than automatically being deemed class C felonies under present law. Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\nAct 181, Session Laws 1987, added language to this section to reflect the recently created statutory murder and attempted murder crimes. These crimes are murder in the first and second degree and attempted murder in the first and second degree. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1130.\n\nBecause criminal solicitation to commit first degree murder is a crime declared to be a felony without specification of class within meaning of this section, it is a class C felony for sentencing purposes, subject to the sentencing provisions of §706-660. 84 H. 229, 933 P.2d 66 (1997).\n\nFor sentencing purposes, conspiracy to commit second degree murder is a class C felony under this section and subject to the sentencing provisions of §706-660, not §706-656. 84 H. 280, 933 P.2d 617 (1997).\n\nAs an attempt to commit a crime is an offense of the same class and grade as the offense which is attempted, and second degree murder committed under the \"aggravated circumstances\" set forth in §706-660.2 is expressly distinguished from classified felonies and, pursuant to this section, from unclassified felonies thus, attempted second degree murder is not an \"unclassified\" offense for purposes of sentencing and is not treated as a class C felony pursuant to §706-660.2. 96 H. 17, 25 P.3d 792 (2001).\n\nSection 291C-12 failure to stop offense committed prior to its 1992 amendment was outside of this code and constituted a class C felony for purposes of sentencing. 9 H.

This section states a policy in favor of withholding a sentence of imprisonment unless, as stated, there is (1) undue risk by repetitive criminal behavior, (2) need for institutionalized correctional facilities, or (3) need to reflect the seriousness of the crime which, under the circumstances of the case, can only be accomplished by imprisonment. The general policy of this section is supplemented by a statement in the following section of grounds which, while not controlling the discretion of the court, should be accorded weight in favor of withholding a sentence of imprisonment.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law, while favoring probation or suspension of sentence by implication, gave the court a free hand--but no guidance--in selecting the proper sentence or disposition.\n\nEvery circuit court, when it appears to its satisfaction that the ends of justice and the best interests of the public as well as of the defendant in a criminal case will be subserved thereby, may after conviction or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere (except in cases of [certain specified crimes[1]]) suspend the imposition or execution of sentence, in full or in part, and place the defendant upon probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as it may deem best.2\n\nThe Code seeks to provide more definitive criteria for the exercise of the broad discretion vested in the court.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-620\n\nAct 89, Session Laws 1988, amended this section for the purpose of mandating harsher penalties for crimes against victims who are less able to protect themselves. The legislature found that passage of these amendments afforded a greater measure of protection for the groups enumerated in this section. House Standing Committee Report No. 459-88, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2544.\n\nAct 229, Session Laws 1994, amended this section to allow the court discretion to sentence a defendant convicted of a class A felony drug offense (as defined in chapter 712, part IV) to probation. The legislature believed that, in certain instances, the public is better served by allowing judges some discretion in evaluating all appropriate sentencing and treatment alternatives available for drug offenders. Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\nAct 197, Session Laws 1996, amended this section to retain probation for the offense of manslaughter, which the Act made a class A felony. The legislature believed that courts should still be given the discretion to sentence a person to probation in \"extremely rare circumstances where strong mitigating circumstances exist.\" Conference Committee Report No. 71.\n\nAct 210, Session Laws 2013, amended this section to prohibit sentencing a defendant to a term of probation if the defendant is convicted of cruelty to animals in the first or second degree involving ten or more pet animals.

The exercise of discretion by different judges cannot be expected to lead to precisely uniform sentences; however, legislative guidelines such as the Code proposes will promote consistency in sentencing.\n\nSuch guides, if properly defined, should serve to promote both the thoughtfulness and consistency of dispositions, while distributing responsibility between the legislature and the court. This is the normal procedure in other fields involving large discretionary powers; there seems no reason why it should not be attempted here.1\n\nThese factors suggest that the court's first concern might be to determine the future danger threatened by the defendant's continued presence in open society, and that it minimize its concern for the purely deterrent purposes of the sanction of imprisonment.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-621\n\nAct 165, Session Laws 1980, deleted former paragraphs (2) and (6) and amended paragraph (8). After reviewing the section, the legislature \"decided to leave a great deal of discretion with the trial court to allow for the greatest possible leeway in dealing effectively with convicted persons.\" Conference Committee Report No. 35-80 (53-80).\n\nAct 316, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to provide that the court, in determining whether to impose a term of probation, shall consider the expedited sentencing program set forth in §706-606.3 if the defendant has qualified for that program. House Standing Committee Report No. 1174, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 849.\n\nAct 157, Session Laws 1995, extended the sunset date of the amendment to this section made by Act 316, Session Laws 1993, from June 30, 1995 to June 30, 2001. The legislature found that the expedited sentencing program served as \"a viable alternative in a small number of select cases\" and that the program should continue to be available within the criminal justice system. However, the legislature believed that there was insufficient basis to determine whether the program should be made permanent. Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\nAct 127, Session Laws 2001, repealed the sunset date for the expedited sentencing program of the family court, and in doing so, also prevented the possibility of the inadvertent repeal of important probation laws established in connection with the program. The purpose of the program was to allow for the expeditious removal of the offender from the family home, in cases of intra-family felony sexual assault or incest, thus allowing the child to remain in the home. The legislature found that the program applied only to those offenders found to be \"safe to probate\" and minimized the possibility of revictimizing the child by eliminating the need to testify and requiring treatment and supervision of all members of the child's family. The legislature further found that the program had been effective and beneficial to the families concerned. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1453, Conference Committee Report No. 114.\n\nThese grounds may be accorded great weight, but do not control the discretion of the court. 60 H. 314, 588 P.2d 929 (1979).\n\nAlthough \"drug use\" is not a prerequisite to eligibility for probation under §706-659, the legislature contemplated, consistent with the factors enumerated in this section, that the trial court would grant probation in cases where strong mitigating circumstances favored it. 97 H. 440, 39 P.3d 567 (2002).\n\nUpon revocation of probation pursuant to §706-625(3), in light of the record, §706-660 and this section, trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to imprisonment \"for a term of not more than ten years with credit for time served\". 97 H. 135 (App.), 34 P.3d 1034 (2001).\n\nCited: 73 H. 81, 829 P.2d 1325 (1992).\n\nMentioned: 76 H. 408, 879 P.2d 513 (1994).\n\n§706-621 Commentary:\n\n1.

If the person fails to complete the substance abuse treatment program and the court determines that the person cannot benefit from any other suitable substance abuse treatment program, the person shall be subject to sentencing under the applicable section under this part. As a condition of probation under this subsection, the court may direct the person to undergo and complete substance abuse treatment under the supervision of the drug court if the person has a history of relapse in treatment programs. The court may require other terms and conditions of probation, including requiring that the person contribute to the cost of the substance abuse treatment program, comply with deadlines for entering into the substance abuse treatment program, and reside in a secure drug treatment facility.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this section, \"substance abuse treatment program\" means drug or substance abuse treatment services provided outside a correctional facility by a public, private, or nonprofit entity that specializes in treating persons who are diagnosed with having substance abuse or dependency and preferably employs licensed professionals or certified substance abuse counselors.\n\n(4) Upon written application from a person sentenced under this part or a probation officer, the court shall issue a court order to expunge the record of conviction for that particular offense; provided that a person has successfully completed the substance abuse treatment program and complied with other terms and conditions of probation. A person sentenced to probation under this section who has not previously been sentenced under this section shall be eligible for one time only for expungement under this subsection.\n\n(5) Upon motion from a person convicted for the possession of marijuana under section 712-1249 arising from a set of facts and circumstances that resulted in no other criminal charge, the court shall grant an expungement order pertaining to the conviction for the offense; provided that the amount of marijuana for which the person was convicted of possessing was three grams or less.\n\n(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to give rise to a cause of action against the State, a state employee, or a treatment provider.

The legislature found that the link between substance abuse and crime is well-established. The legislature did not wish to diminish the seriousness of crime, but looked to approaching crime as being the result of addiction that is treatable. The treatment route was expected to produce a reduction in crime and recidivism. The legislature intended to promote treatment of nonviolent substance abuse offenders, rather than incarceration, as being in the best interests of the individual and the community at large. Conference Committee Report No. 96-02.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) to exclude the offenses of methamphetamine trafficking in the first and second degrees from the offenses for which first-time drug offenders may be eligible to be sentenced to probation.\n\nAct 4, Special Session Laws 2009, amended subsection (2) authorizing the placement of certain drug offenders in secure drug treatment facilities, to promote the rehabilitation of convicted drug offenders through alternatives to incarceration. The legislature found that providing convicted drug offenders with drug rehabilitation programs in a secure drug treatment facility would reduce the offenders' rate of recidivism upon release and help the offenders develop an important and meaningful role in society. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1285, Conference Committee Report No. 25.\n\nAct 140, Session Laws 2012, amended this section by: (1) allowing for the sentence of probation for certain second time drug offenses; and (2) clarifying that a person sentenced to probation as a first time drug offender who has not been previously sentenced to probation as a drug offender shall be eligible for expungement only once. The legislature found that the rates of crime, victimization, and arrests and felony convictions for violent and property crimes had declined, while the number of persons incarcerated or under probation supervision, in some cases, had increased. The legislature also found that existing law required the courts to impose a prison sentence for an offender who had a second felony conviction for drug possession. Act 140 amended the law to allow for second time drug offenders to be eligible for probation. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3352, Conference Committee Report No. 130-12.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsections (1) and (4) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 102, Session Laws 2018, made a housekeeping amendment to this section to clarify that eligibility for probation does not apply to certain drug paraphernalia violations that had been decriminalized. This amendment was intended to make the law governing the probation of drug offenders consistent with Act 72, Session Laws 2017, which decriminalized certain offenses related to the use, possession, and delivery of drug paraphernalia. As a result of Act 72, statutory language governing probation eligibility for offenders convicted of those offenses was no longer relevant. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3029, House Standing Committee Report No. 442-18.\n\nAct 273, Session Laws 2019, amended this section to provide for the expungement of criminal records pertaining solely to the possession of three grams or less of marijuana. The legislature found that ten states and the District of Columbia had legalized the recreational use of marijuana by adults, and that others were in the process of considering legalization. The legislature further found that legalization in these states had avoided the criminalization of thousands of people, reduced opioid overdose deaths and untreated opioid use disorders, and lowered the number of arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs. In addition, recent polling indicated broad public support in Hawaii for the legalization of marijuana. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1429.\n\nInasmuch as the plain and unambiguous language of §706-606.5 requires application of the repeat offender statute over \"any other law to the contrary\", the circuit court did not err in sentencing defendant as a repeat offender pursuant to §706-606.5; in all cases in which §706-606.5 is applicable, including those in which a defendant would otherwise be eligible for probation under this section, the circuit courts must sentence defendants pursuant to the provisions of §706-606.5. 103 H. 228, 81 P.3d 408 (2003).\n\nDefendants with prior felony convictions of drug offenses are disqualified from sentencing pursuant to this section, even if the convictions occurred in other jurisdictions and therefore not \"under part IV of chapter 712\", so long as the offenses would implicate part IV of chapter 712 if committed in Hawaii. 104 H. 71, 85 P.3d 178 (2004).\n\nBy its plain language, Act 44, L 2004, prospectively permitted greater discretion to sentencing courts confronted with conflicts between this section and §706-606.5 than they previously possessed; thus, based on the legislative intent reflected in Act 44, the Act 161, L 2002 version of this section, under which defendant was sentenced, did not trump the repeat offender statute. 106 H. 1, 100 P.3d 595 (2004).\n\nAs section is ameliorative in its intent and effect and its application would neither be detrimental nor materially disadvantageous to the defendant, retrospective application of this section as established by Act 161, L 2002, was not prohibited; where defendant did not qualify as a first-time drug offender, the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant pursuant to §712-1243(3) (2002). 107 H. 215, 112 P.3d 69 (2005).\n\nConsistent with §706-625(1), because petitioner, who was sentenced to probation under subsection (1), had completed petitioner's probation term and was subsequently discharged and thus \"satisfied the disposition of the court\", as provided by §706-630, petitioner had, in effect, complied with the terms and conditions of probation for purposes of expungement under subsection (4). 129 H. 363, 300 P.3d 1022 (2013).",

L 2012, c 140, §5.\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-623\n\nThis section is in accord with previous Hawaii law providing a maximum probation period of five years in felony cases.[1] The prior law did not, however, state a maximum period of suspension of sentence in felony cases--although, by implication, it could have been read as five years also.[2] With respect to felony cases, this section of the Code changes the law by explicitly correlating the maximum period of suspension with the maximum period of probation. Whether the defendant should be sentenced to probation because the defendant needs supervision, guidance, assistance, or direction is an independent question; there is no rational basis for providing a longer period for suspension than for probation.\n\nBecause of the structure of courts in Hawaii, some anomalous results obtained under prior law. Upon the appeal of a misdemeanor case from the district court to the circuit court, the defendant, if conviction was upheld, could have had the defendant's sentence suspended or be sentenced to probation in the same manner and for the same period as a convicted felon.[3] Had the misdemeanant not appealed the misdemeanant would have been subject solely to the district court, the powers of which were more limited in this area. Prior to this Code, the district court did not have a probation service; however, the district magistrate could suspend the imposition or execution of sentence on the terms or conditions the district magistrate deemed best. The period of suspension could not, however, exceed thirteen months.[4]\n\nThe changes which this section makes in the law are obvious. It provides a maximum period of suspension of sentence or probation for misdemeanants, petty misdemeanants, and felons regardless of the court handling the case. Secondly, it would allow probation to be utilized by district court magistrates if a probation service is established in that court.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-623\n\nSection 623 of the Proposed Code provided that the period of suspension or probation shall be two years in the case of a conviction for a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor. However, the Legislature reduced the period to one year in the case of a conviction for a misdemeanor and six months in the case of a conviction for a petty misdemeanor, finding the proposed two-year period too severe and inconsistent with the actual length of imprisonment allowed upon conviction for these offenses. Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\nAct 124, Session Laws 1989, required courts to grant pre-sentence imprisonment credit to defendants who had been sentenced to imprisonment as a condition of probation and who were detained prior to sentencing. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1342.\n\nAct 316, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to provide that the terms of probation in chapter 706, part II, other than in this section, shall not apply to sentences of probation imposed under §706-606.3, which creates an option for the expedited sentencing of persons who have committed intra-family sexual assault. House Standing Committee Report No. 1174, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 849.\n\nAct 229, Session Laws 1994, amended this section to provide, inter alia, that when a defendant is sentenced to be placed on probation, the period of probation shall be ten years upon conviction of a class A felony unless the court enters the reason therefor on the record and sentences the defendant to a shorter period of probation. The legislature found that a longer probationary period for class A felony drug offenders would protect the public's interests and safety in the unusual cases where probation may be granted. Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\nAct 157, Session Laws 1995, extended the sunset date of the amendment to this section made by Act 316, Session Laws 1993, from June 30, 1995 to June 30, 2001. The legislature found that the expedited sentencing program served as \"a viable alternative in a small number of select cases\" and that the program should continue to be available within the criminal justice system. However, the legislature believed that there was insufficient basis to determine whether the program should be made permanent. Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\nAct 172, Session Laws 1998, amended this section to allow for a two-year sentence of probation for domestic violence convictions. Conference Committee Report No. 80.\n\nAct 127, Session Laws 2001, repealed the sunset date for the expedited sentencing program of the family court, and in doing so, also prevented the possibility of the inadvertent repeal of important probation laws established in connection with the program. The purpose of the program was to allow for the expeditious removal of the offender from the family home, in cases of intra-family felony sexual assault or incest, thus allowing the child to remain in the home. The legislature found that the program applied only to those offenders found to be \"safe to probate\" and minimized the possibility of revictimizing the child by eliminating the need to testify and requiring treatment and supervision of all members of the child's family. The legislature further found that the program had been effective and beneficial to the families concerned. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1453, Conference Committee Report No. 114.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) to allow a six-month extension of probation for a petty misdemeanor if good cause is found. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 88, Session Laws 2009, amended subsection (1) to permit probationary periods of eighteen to twenty-four months for persons convicted under various conditions for driving under the influence. Act 88 continued to promote highway safety by statutorily establishing several recommendations of the ignition interlock implementation task force established by Act 171, Session Laws 2008. House Standing Committee Report No. 617, Conference Committee Report No. 116.\n\nAct 166, Session Laws 2010, amended subsection (1) by eliminating probationary provisions for convicted second and third driving under the influence offenders. Act 166 continued the work of the ignition interlock implementation task force, as a final implementation of the recommendations regarding the ignition interlock device program. The legislature found that although gains were made in reducing both driving under the influence arrests and the total number of alcohol-related fatalities, today's offender is more likely to have a highly elevated alcohol concentration and, as a whole, Hawaii's rate of alcohol-related fatalities remains unacceptably high. However, people with revoked licenses still need to get to work, to transport their families, and to fulfill other obligations, and there often is no efficient alternative to driving. Just as there is no single cause of this problem, there is no single solution, and Hawaii needs another tool to address it. House Standing Committee Report No. 718-10, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2167, Conference Committee Report No. 88-10.\n\nAct 140, Session Laws 2012, amended this section by: (1) allowing for probation for a period of four years for certain class B or class C felonies; and (2) clarifying that prior to granting early discharge, a defendant's probation officer must report to the court concerning the defendant's non-compliance, in addition to the defendant's compliance with the conditions of the defendant's probation. The legislature found that Act 140 was an outgrowth of the Justice Reinvestment Working Group and the Council of State Governments Justice Center to study, analyze, and make recommendations for improvements in the criminal justice system and corrections system in all fifty states. The analysis revealed that crime and victimization rates in Hawaii have declined, as have arrests and felony convictions for violent and property crimes. However, the population under probation supervision and incarceration has not declined, and in some cases had increased. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2973, Conference Committee Report No. 130-12.\n\nAct 143, Session Laws 2012, amended this section to require a defendant's probation officer to provide the court information regarding the defendant's compliance or non-compliance with probation prior to the court determining whether to grant an early discharge from probation. The legislature found that under existing law, the court may grant early discharge from probation without input from a defendant's probation officer regarding that defendant's compliance with probation terms. Act 143 served as an additional tool for the courts to use in their assessment and determination of whether a defendant should be discharged from probation early. Conference Committee Report No. 73-12.\n\nAct 19, Session Laws 2020, amended this section for a five-year pilot period by authorizing courts to sentence defendants to up to one year of probation upon conviction for the petty misdemeanor offense of abuse of family or household members established by Act 19. The legislature found that the probationary period of up to one year would ensure that defendants have sufficient time to complete mandatory terms imposed by courts and that the probationary time would be equal to that of defendants who have been granted a motion for a deferred acceptance of guilty plea. The legislature also found that domestic violence intervention requires varied approaches to meet the broad spectrum of severity. Existing laws were not inclusive enough to encompass the entirety of the spectrum, given that some instances of low-level force by the perpetrator were insufficient to meet the criteria of abuse of a family or household member. The legislature noted that the dynamics of domestic violence are complicated and a more flexible approach may be necessary in sentencing defendants in cases involving abuse of family or household members. Act 19 sought to provide this flexibility while still holding defendants accountable for their actions.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1973, c 136, §5; am L 1978, c 224, §1; am L 1984, c 257, §2; am L 1986, c 314, §25; am L 1987, c 262, §1; am L 1989, c 48, §1; am L 2006, c 230, §20; am L 2012, c 292, §3; am L 2016, c 231, §23]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-624\n\nPrevious Hawaii law provided the sentencing court with limited guidance or control in the exercise of its discretion in imposing conditions upon suspension of sentence or upon sentence to probation. The circuit court could impose \"such terms and conditions as it may deem best\" and was specifically authorized to condition probation on (1) commitment to the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility, (2) periodic or intermittent confinement in a county jail, (3) payment of a fine in a prescribed manner, (4) restitution or reparation, and (5) providing support to a person for whose support the defendant is legally responsible.[1] District courts could condition suspension of sentence on \"such terms and conditions as the magistrate may deem best.\" The magistrate was specifically authorized to condition suspension on (1) periodic or intermittent confinement in jail, and (2) attendance at a traffic course or school prescribed by the magistrate.[2]\n\nThe Code seeks to focus on various appropriate conditions without limiting unduly the exercise of judicial discretion. Subsection (2) presents various authorized conditions and subsection (2)(m) is intended to insure flexibility for the court in devising the imposing conditions, provided the \"conditions reasonably relate to the rehabilitation of the defendant.\"\n\nSubsection (3) continues past statutory authorization for limited imprisonment as a condition of probation, but sets the maximum at six months. Probation and imprisonment are in some respects inconsistent with one another. Probation attempts to correct the defendant without interrupting the defendant's contact with open society. Imprisonment, on the other hand, is the isolation of the defendant from open society. Notwithstanding this area of inconsistency, the Code recognizes the utility of providing a limited degree of imprisonment as a possible condition of probation.\n\nSubsection (3) also continues the past policy of the law by providing that the court may order that the term of imprisonment required to be served as a condition of probation be served intermittently. Thus, the court may, for example, order that the defendant serve the defendant's period of confinement at nights or on weekends so that undue economic hardship will not result to the defendant or members of the defendant's family.\n\nSubsection (4) is an addition to the law suggested by the Model Penal Code and accepted in other states.3 The intent is to provide the defendant with notice of what is expected of the defendant in a form which will not escape the defendant's memory.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-624\n\nAct 136, Session Laws 1973, amended subsection (3) by deleting a sentence which provided that upon revocation of probation any term of imprisonment served as part of the probation shall not be credited toward the subsequent imprisonment. The legislature felt that the allowance of credit would do equity. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 858, House Standing Committee Report No. 726.\n\nAct 224, Session Laws 1978, amended subsection (3) to authorize a court when sentencing a felon to probation to impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year as a condition of probation. The amendment is intended to give the court the discretion to require a convicted felon to serve a longer term of imprisonment as a condition of probation than a person convicted of a misdemeanor. Under prior law the maximum term of imprisonment, whether for a felon or for a misdemeanant, was set at six months.\n\nAct 257, Session Laws 1984, added subsection (2)(g) to allow a court, as a condition of a suspended sentence or probation, to restrict a convicted person from entering certain geographical areas without the court's permission.\n\nAct 262, Session Laws 1987, amended this section to provide home detention as an alternative to incarceration. The use of home detention is limited. It is not meant to be used as a means to reduce the prison population, or as a means to place a prisoner on probation or early release where the prisoner is in need of intensive supervision or is not eligible or qualified for early parole. The legislature does not intend home detention to be used by a court as justification to sentence a convicted person to probation if the person would not otherwise be sentenced to probation under the existing discretionary conditions. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 61, House Conference Committee Report No. 35.\n\nAct 48, Session Laws 1989, required convicted persons on work release to pay a percentage of their earnings for restitution. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1133, House Standing Committee Report No. 629.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by, among other things, (1) expanding the conditions of probation to include prohibiting the defendant from engaging in criminal conduct in any foreign or military jurisdiction that would constitute a crime under Hawaii law during the term of probation; (2) requiring the defendant to make restitution to the victim if ordered by the court; (3) increasing the terms of imprisonment that may be imposed as part of a sentence of probation and including five days' imprisonment for petty misdemeanors; and (4) including ammunition as an item that a person on probation may be prohibited from possessing. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 292, Session Laws 2012, amended subsection (2) by providing the courts with discretion when determining terms of imprisonment for various offenses and stipulating maximum terms of imprisonment for these offenses. The legislature noted that traffic related fatalities were a serious issue and that persons convicted of certain offenses involving traffic fatalities should be dealt with accordingly. Further, the legislature believed that a judge should continue to hold the discretionary authority regarding the term of imprisonment as a condition of probation for a person convicted of manslaughter. Finally, allowing the courts the discretion to impose terms of imprisonment for certain violations up to a maximum period would help to ensure the safety of Hawaii's roadways. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3229, Conference Committee Report No. 44-12.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (2) to authorize a court, among other things, to add, as a condition for probation under certain circumstances, that a defendant submit to searches by a probation officer of the defendant's person, residence, vehicle, or other sites and property under the defendant's control, and to sign a waiver of extradition and pay extradition costs as the court may determine. Conference Committee Report No. 138-16.\n\nCondition that defendant \"refrain from company of people of questionable character\" was not invalid for vagueness. 59 H. 366, 580 P.2d 1282 (1978).\n\nConditions imposed must be reasonable. 59 H. 378, 581 P.2d 759 (1978).\n\nWhere time for performing condition is not specified, performance is to be within a reasonable time. 59 H. 378, 581 P.2d 759 (1978).\n\nPurpose and intent is to have convicted person make restitution for criminal acts; court can delegate function of making recommendations regarding restitution but cannot delegate sentencing function. 68 H. 292, 711 P.2d 1295 (1985).\n\nRequirement that defendant submit to periodic urinalysis for drugs was proper. 72 H. 67, 806 P.2d 407 (1991).\n\nIf, at a combined sentencing disposition, imprisonment is imposed as a condition in more than one probation sentence, the period of imprisonment served for concurrent sentences of probation shall not exceed the maximum term allowed for a sentence of probation. 97 H. 430, 39 P.3d 557 (2002).\n\nIn a sentence of probation, imprisonment may be imposed only as a condition of the sentence of probation, not to exceed the maximum term established in subsection (2)(a). 97 H. 430, 39 P.3d 557 (2002).\n\nA sentencing court may not impose discretionary conditions of probation pursuant to subsection (2) unless there is a factual basis in the record indicating that such conditions \"are reasonably related to the factors set forth in §706-606\" and insofar as such \"conditions involve only deprivations of liberty or property\", that they are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in §706-606(2). 103 H. 462, 83 P.3d 725 (2004).\n\nBased on defendant's history, the circumstances of the case, and the seriousness of the offense, the family court did not exceed the bounds of reason or disregard rules or principles of law to the substantial detriment of defendant when it sentenced defendant to undergo sex offender evaluation and treatment as a condition of probation. 107 H. 117, 111 P.3d 12 (2005).\n\nA straightforward reading of subsection (3) prohibits the adoption of an \"actual notice\" rule; thus, under the plain and unambiguous language of subsection (3), it is mandated that defendants be given written copies of their conditions. 118 H. 15, 185 P.3d 200 (2008).\n\nIn connection with the conditions from this section that are incorporated by reference in §853-1, the \"provision\" in subsection (3) that requires a defendant who is granted probation to be given a written copy of the conditions, must necessarily apply to a defendant granted a deferred acceptance of guilty plea, who must adhere to such similar conditions. 118 H. 15, 185 P.3d 200 (2008).\n\nDefendant's probation may not be revoked for failure to comply with special condition of probation, even though defendant was never provided with written notice of that condition, as required by subsection (3). 10 H. App. 192, 862 P.2d 295 (1993).\n\nSeven-day term of imprisonment was not unreasonably related to factors set forth in §706-606, considering nature of offense and circumstances presented by the record. 10 H. App. 381, 876 P.2d 1331 (1994).\n\nBased on this statute and §706-671(1), sentencing court would have no authority to sentence defendant to five years' probation and more than one year in prison; furthermore, the court was required to credit defendant for time already served in pre-trial detention. 79 H. 317 (App.), 901 P.2d 1296 (1995).\n\nIn light of paragraph (n), family court was authorized to require defendant to undergo polygraph testing as a reasonable condition of the granting of defendant's deferred acceptance of nolo contendere plea under §853-1. 92 H. 289 (App.), 990 P.2d 1171 (1999).\n\nWhere, pursuant to paragraph (3) (2005), defendant did not receive a written copy of the conditions of defendant's deferred acceptance of no contest plea, trial court erred in setting aside plea. 116 H. 38 (App.), 169 P.3d 990 (2007).\n\nFamily court did not abuse its discretion by requiring defendant to attend domestic violence counseling as a condition of defendant's probation; where defendant was charged with endangering the welfare of an incompetent person under §709-905 based on substantial evidence that defendant assaulted complainant, under subsection (2), the court was free to impose discretionary conditions of probation that are reasonably related to the factors set forth in §706-606 and to the extent that the conditions involve only deprivations of liberty as is reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in §706-606(2). 121 H. 228 (App.), 216 P.3d 1251 (2009).\n\nBecause there was no provision in §706-605 for the imposition of anger management or other treatment programs, but subsection (2)(j) authorized the imposition of, inter alia, mental health treatment as a discretionary term of probation, district court erred by sentencing defendant to both the thirty-day term of imprisonment (the maximum term of imprisonment for a petty misdemeanor) and anger management classes for defendant's harassment conviction (a petty misdemeanor). Defendant could have been sentenced to a thirty-day term of incarceration or a six-month term of probation, but not both, and thus defendant's sentence was illegal. 130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033 (2013).\n\nCited: 73 H. 81, 829 P.2d 1325 (1992).\n\nDiscussed: 78 H. 343, 893 P.2d 194 (1995).\n\nMentioned: 74 H. 75, 837 P.2d 776 (1992).\n\n§706-624 Commentary:\n\n1.

      "text": "§706-625 Revocation, modification of probation conditions.(1) The court, on application of a probation officer, the prosecuting attorney, the defendant, or on its own motion, after a hearing, may revoke probation except as provided in subsection (7), reduce or enlarge the conditions of a sentence of probation, pursuant to the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the conditions and the provisions of section 706-627.\n\n(2) The prosecuting attorney, the defendant's probation officer, and the defendant shall be notified by the movant in writing of the time, place, and date of any such hearing, and of the grounds upon which action under this section is proposed. The prosecuting attorney, the defendant's probation officer, and the defendant may appear in the hearing to oppose or support the application, and may submit evidence for the court's consideration. The defendant shall have the right to be represented by counsel. For purposes of this section the court shall not be bound by the Hawaii rules of evidence, except for the rules pertaining to privileges.\n\n(3) The court shall revoke probation if the defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of the order or has been convicted of a felony. The court may revoke the suspension of sentence or probation if the defendant has been convicted of another crime other than a felony.\n\n(4) The court may modify the requirements imposed on the defendant or impose further requirements, if it finds that such action will assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.\n\n(5) When the court revokes probation, it may impose on the defendant any sentence that might have been imposed originally for the crime of which the defendant was convicted.\n\n(6) As used in this section, \"conviction\" means that a judgment has been pronounced upon the verdict.\n\n(7) The court may require a defendant to undergo and complete a substance abuse treatment program when the defendant has committed a violation of the terms and conditions of probation involving possession or use, not including to distribute or manufacture as defined in section 712-1240, of any dangerous drug, detrimental drug, harmful drug, intoxicating compound, marijuana, or marijuana concentrate, as defined in section 712-1240, unlawful methamphetamine trafficking as provided in section 712-1240.6, or involving possession or use of drug paraphernalia under section 329-43.5. If the defendant fails to complete the substance abuse treatment program or the court determines that the defendant cannot benefit from any other suitable substance abuse treatment program, the defendant shall be subject to revocation of probation and incarceration. The court may require the defendant to:\n\n(a) Be assessed by a certified substance abuse counselor for substance abuse dependency or abuse under the applicable Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and Addiction Severity Index;\n\n(b) Present a proposal to receive substance abuse treatment in accordance with the treatment plan prepared by a certified substance abuse counselor through a substance abuse treatment program that includes an identified source of payment for the treatment program;\n\n(c) Contribute to the cost of the substance abuse treatment program; and\n\n(d) Comply with any other terms and conditions of probation.\n\nAs used in this subsection, \"substance abuse treatment program\" means drug or substance abuse treatment services provided outside a correctional facility by a public, private, or nonprofit entity that specializes in treating persons who are diagnosed with substance abuse or dependency and preferably employs licensed professionals or certified substance abuse counselors.\n\nNothing in this subsection shall be construed to give rise to a cause of action against the State, a state employee, or a treatment provider.

Such power is essential if the disposition is to remain flexible. However, if an increase in the severity of the conditions is proposed, the court must accord the defendant the procedural rights stated in §706-627.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-625\n\nAct 192, Session Laws 1985, amended this section and consolidated it with the law governing the revocation of probation or suspension of sentence, formerly contained in §706-628 and part of §706-627. As a result, §706-628 is repealed.\n\nAct 45, Session Laws 1989, defined the word \"conviction\" as applied in the revocation or modification of probation conditions. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1282, House Standing Committee Report No. 844.\n\nAct 5, Session Laws 1994, amended this section by changing the subsection designations from letters to numbers for the purpose of consistency in the Hawaii Penal Code. Subsection references throughout the Penal Code are designated by numbers rather than letters. House Standing Committee Report No. 329-94, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2638.\n\nAct 161, Session Laws 2002, amended this section to require the court not to revoke probation for the first violation of a nonviolent drug-related probation condition, and to require that the probation violators be sentenced to undergo and complete drug treatment instead of incarceration. The legislature found that the link between substance abuse and crime is well-established. The legislature did not wish to diminish the seriousness of crime, but looked to approaching crime as being the result of addiction that is treatable. The treatment route was expected to produce a reduction in crime and recidivism. The legislature intended to promote treatment of nonviolent substance abuse offenders, rather than incarceration, as being in the best interests of the individual and the community at large. Conference Committee Report No. 96-02.\n\nCriteria for modification. 55 H. 632, 525 P.2d 1119 (1974).\n\nMandated revocation of probation under certain circumstances is a means to compel a court to review defendant's original sentence in light of new facts. Court may reimpose the same sentence. 69 H. 424, 744 P.2d 1208 (1987).\n\nDefendant was prejudiced because of inability to independently test urine samples. 70 H. 194, 767 P.2d 243 (1989).\n\nCourt had discretion to consider factors other than defendant's wilfulness in determining whether failure to comply with probation condition was inexcusable under section. 73 H. 81, 829 P.2d 1325 (1992).\n\nStatutory language of subsection (e) (1992) must be harmonized with §706-671(2), mandating credit for time served in imprisonment. 78 H. 343, 893 P.2d 194 (1995).\n\nCourt abused discretion in revoking defendant's probation where defendant made the monthly payments as condition of probation and there was no other justifiable cause for revocation. 79 H. 511, 904 P.2d 525 (1995).\n\nSubsection (5), which permits a trial court on revocation of probation to impose any sentence that might have originally been imposed at the time of conviction, does not apply to the sentencing procedure attendant to revocation of a deferred acceptance of guilty plea, which is already specifically governed by §853-3. 93 H. 362, 3 P.3d 1239 (2000).\n\nWhere petitioner lacked \"written notice\" that probation revocation was sought because petitioner was a high risk to commit another offense, and petitioner was not notified of the \"evidence\" of other sexual assaults that was used \"against\" petitioner in seeking revocation, petitioner's due process rights were violated. 125 H. 114, 254 P.3d 425 (2011).\n\nConsistent with subsection (1), because petitioner, who was sentenced to probation under §706-622.5(1), had completed petitioner's probation term and was subsequently discharged and thus \"satisfied the disposition of the court\", as provided by §706-630, petitioner had, in effect, complied with the terms and conditions of probation for purposes of expungement under §706-622.5(4). 129 H. 363, 300 P.3d 1022 (2013).\n\nFor purposes of determining whether a defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of a probation order, courts should consider (1) whether the defendant's actions were intentional; and (2) whether the defendant's actions, if intentional, were a deliberate attempt to circumvent the court's probation order, considering the goals of sentencing the defendant to probation. 132 H. 209, 320 P.3d 874 (2014).\n\nIn probation modification or revocation hearings, courts should apply a \"good cause\" standard for determining whether a continuance should be granted; family court abused its discretion in denying defendant's request for a continuance, where defendant had \"good cause\" for requesting a continuance and the court's error in failing to grant a continuance was not harmless. 132 H. 209, 320 P.3d 874 (2014).\n\nCourt cannot revoke probation and impose new probation term. 6 H. App. 253, 718 P.2d 1117 (1986).\n\nWhere defendant made conscious and wilful decision to fail to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of probation under subsection (3), court did not abuse discretion in revoking probation and imposing sentence which may have been originally imposed. 82 H. 441 (App.), 922 P.2d 1054 (1996).\n\nCircuit court properly concluded that it was required to revoke defendant's probation pursuant to subsection (c) because of subsequent felony conviction. 83 H. 102 (App.), 924 P.2d 596 (1996).\n\nWhen defendant refused to admit having committed the sex crimes and failed to pass the lie detector tests, defendant did not \"inexcusably\" fail to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of the probation order under subsection (3) as the trial court could not order defendant to admit defendant's sex crimes and defendant did not personally expressly and explicitly agree to admit defendant's sex crimes and to accept probation on that basis. 93 H. 321 (App.), 2 P.3d 725 (2000).\n\nUpon revocation of probation pursuant to subsection (3), in light of the record, § §706-660 and 706-621, trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to imprisonment \"for a term of not more than ten years with credit for time served\". 97 H. 135 (App.), 34 P.3d 1034 (2001).\n\nWhere defendant failed to submit to drug/alcohol assessments, failed to report to defendant's probation officer, failed to notify probation officer of a change in address, and failed to pay the crime victim compensation and probation service fees, these violations of defendant's terms and conditions of probation did not involve the possession or use of drugs as meant under subsection (7); thus, trial court erred in its interpretation and application of this subsection. 112 H. 208 (App.), 145 P.3d 751 (2006).\n\nCriminal contempt of court under §710-1077 is not available as a sanction for a violation of a condition of probation as there is no provision in this chapter that authorizes the use of criminal contempt as a sanction for violation of a condition of probation; the exclusive sanctions for a violation of a condition of probation in this chapter are set forth in this section. 120 H. 312 (App.), 205 P.3d 577 (2009).\n\n_______________\n\n§706-625 Commentary:\n\n1.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §28; am L 1989, c 125, §1; am L 2001, c 24, §1 and c 91, §4]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-626\n\nThe court, in order to control the conditions of suspension or probation, must have power, either by summons or warrant, to require the defendant to appear before the court. Subsection (1) provides this power. Subsection (2) provides a more limited power for probation and peace officers; they may arrest without a warrant only where there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has failed to comply with a condition of probation or suspension.\n\nSubsection (3) is addressed to the problem presented by a defendant who is on probation or under suspended sentence and who is accused or charged with commission of another crime. The commission of a crime while on probation or under suspension of sentence would, in most cases, constitute a violation of a condition of probation or suspension. The question thus presented is whether the issue of guilt, with respect to the most recent crime, should be tried informally as a violation of a condition of suspension or probation or whether the issue should be tried independently. The Code resolves this question by providing that the defendant may be held pending an independent or formal determination by the court having jurisdiction over the charge, thus preserving for the defendant all procedural rights. This subsection must be read in conjunction with §706-628(1) which provides for revocation in cases where the defendant \"has been convicted of another crime.\"\n\nSubsection (1) is in substantial accord with prior law governing the circuit courts.[1] Subsection (2) is an addition to the law and subsection (3) represents a slight departure from it. The circuit court apparently had the power--although it may choose not to exercise it--to decide, in a probation proceeding, the issue of whether the defendant has committed a crime during the period of probation.2\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-626\n\nAct 125, Session Laws 1989, required that a probationer be placed in custody after arrest for a probation violation and permitted an arrested probationer to post bail in certain circumstances. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1331.\n\nAct 24, Session Laws 2001, amended this section to authorize probation or peace officers to admit defendants to bail when the punishment for the original offense does not exceed one year. Although law enforcement personnel may set bail for petty misdemeanor and misdemeanor offenses, they are not authorized to do so for probation violators and must defer to the courts. The legislature found that the ability to immediately arrest and set bail for petty misdemeanor and misdemeanor probationers would allow more efficient processing of probation violations. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1516, House Standing Committee Report No. 547.\n\nSubsection (3) should not be read to mean that statutes on probation are concerned only with offenses committed after a defendant is placed on probation. Implications arising from this section and commentary cannot be used to define language of §706-628(1). 62 H. 159, 612 P.2d 1168 (1980).\n\nEvidentiary requirements of subsection (3), satisfaction of. 1 H.

The period of tolling shall be computed from the filing date of the motion through and including the filing date of the written decision of the court concerning the motion for purposes of computation of the remaining period of probation, if any. In the event the court fails to file a written decision upon the motion, the period shall be computed by reference to the date the court makes a decision upon the motion in open court. During the period of tolling of the probation, the defendant shall remain subject to all terms and conditions of the probation except as otherwise provided by this chapter.\n\n(2) In the event the court, following hearing, refuses to revoke the probation or grant the requested enlargement of conditions thereof because the defendant's failure to comply therewith was excusable, the defendant may be granted the period of tolling of the probation for purposes of computation of the remaining probation, if any.

That a defendant has no right to suspension or probation does not justify the alteration of his status by methods that must seem and sometimes be unfair.2\n\nAlthough written notice, the right to be represented by counsel, and the right to controvert and be heard upon the evidence, are provided by this section, it is not contemplated that the court must strictly enforce the rules of evidence. In this type of hearing, where the relevant issues are decided by a court without the presence of a jury, the court should be granted some flexibility in this area.\n\nAct 106, Session Laws 1977, added subsections (2) and (3) to provide for tolling the period of probation or suspension of sentence pending the hearing to revoke the probation or suspension or to increase the conditions thereof. Formerly, with no tolling provisions, it was possible for the period of probation or suspended sentence to run out before termination of the hearing, relieving defendant of any further obligation even though the defendant may have committed acts justifying change in the defendant's probation or suspension status. The amended section is intended to prevent such situations from occurring.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §30]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-629\n\nThis section reflects the Code's preference for concurrent sentences and its disfavor of consecutive sentences.[1]\n\nSubsection (1) deals with the problems presented when the disposition of a defendant involves more than one offense or when a defendant, already under sentence or suspension of sentence, is convicted for an offense committed prior to the former disposition.\n\nSubsection (1)(a) continues the position of the Code that probation and imprisonment are inconsistent dispositions unless imprisonment is limited to a short period of six months or less.2\n\nSubsection (1)(b) provides that periods of suspension or probation run concurrently from the date of the first disposition. If imprisonment is not warranted, there hardly seems any justification for providing elongated periods of suspension or probation when the disposition of the defendant involves more than one offense or when a defendant, already under suspension of sentence or on probation, is convicted for a crime committed prior to the former disposition.\n\nSubsection (1)(c) provides that service of an indeterminate term of imprisonment, with its built-in term of parole, shall satisfy a suspended sentence on another count or a prior suspended sentence or a prior sentence to probation. By providing that the indeterminate term of imprisonment satisfies the other dispositions, subsection (1)(c) results in substantial concurrent service of all dispositions.\n\nBy providing that periods of suspension or probation run during a period of imprisonment for a definite term, subsection (1)(d) provides concurrent service of dispositions in situations involving suspension or probation and a definite term of imprisonment.\n\nSubsection (2) is addressed to a somewhat different problem: multiple dispositions involving an offense committed while under suspension of sentence or on probation.\n\nSubsection (2)(a) provides that if the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the service of such sentence shall satisfy the prior unrevoked suspended sentence or sentence to probation. This is in conformity with the concept of concurrent dispositions.\n\nSubsection (2)(b) provides that if the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for a definite term, the period of the prior suspension or prior probation shall not run during imprisonment. This is a slight departure from the policy of the Code generally favoring concurrent dispositions. However, because definite terms of imprisonment are relatively short, and because the defendant has committed a crime while under suspension or on probation, the situation calls for a departure from the general policy and permits dispositions which are to be served consecutively. This subsection is analogous to §706-668 which permits consecutive terms of imprisonment for crimes committed while in prison. A further consideration for subsection (2)(b) is that, if the period of suspension of probation runs during a definite term of imprisonment (which does not have a built-in term of parole), there might, in some cases, not be sufficient means for court control following discharge of the defendant from imprisonment.\n\nFinally, subsection (2)(c) provides that, where the court has not revoked a prior disposition of suspension or probation and has imposed an additional period of suspension or probation, the multiple periods shall run either concurrently or consecutively as the court determines at the time of sentence. Once again, although this subsection represents a limited departure from the policy of the Code favoring concurrent service of dispositions, it is called for by the defendant's situation. Again, it is analogous to the powers that the Code grants the sentencing court, under §706-668, in cases where a prisoner has committed a crime while in prison or during escape.\n\nImprisonment for a felony does not toll a prior probation sentence for an unrelated felony. 71 H. 612, 801 P.2d 1206 (1990).\n\nIf, at a combined sentencing disposition, imprisonment is imposed as a condition in more than one probation sentence, the period of imprisonment served for concurrent sentences of probation shall not exceed the maximum term allowed for a sentence of probation. 97 H. 430, 39 P.3d 557 (2002).\n\nSubsection (1) applies to the combined sentencing disposition for multiple convictions, irrespective of whether the crimes were charged or tried in separate cases; subsection (1)(b) requires that in the event multiple sentences of probation are imposed, the sentences must run concurrently. 97 H. 430, 39 P.3d 557 (2002).\n\n§706-629 Commentary:\n\n1.

Upon termination of the statutory period, the defendant is relieved of any further obligation by operation of law. This provision is a continuation of prior Hawaii law.1\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-630\n\nAct 269, Session Laws 1998, amended this section to allow victims of crime to enforce a criminal restitution order in the same manner as a civil judgment. Conference Committee Report No. 89.\n\nConsistent with §706-625(1), because petitioner, who was sentenced to probation under §706-622.5(1), had completed petitioner's probation term and was subsequently discharged and thus \"satisfied the disposition of the court\", as provided by this section, petitioner had, in effect, complied with the terms and conditions of probation for purposes of expungement under §706-622.5(4). 129 H. 363, 300 P.3d 1022 (2013).\n\nWhere defendant paid all monthly restitution amounts imposed as a condition of probation sentence, there were no other grounds in record to revoke defendant's probation, and probation term had expired, under this section (1993), defendant should have been relieved of the obligations imposed by the probation sentence; trial court thus erred in imposing \"free-standing\" restitution order remaining in full force and effect beyond termination of defendant's term of probation. 92 H. 36 (App.), 986 P.2d 987 (1999).\n\nWhere Act 269's 1998 amendment took effect after defendant was sentenced, by its own terms did not apply retroactively to extend defendant's obligation to pay restitution beyond defendant's period of probation, and did not empower the trial court to resentence defendant to a freestanding restitution order, as defendant was not in violation of defendant's conditions of probation stated in the 1995 resentencing order, trial court had no authority to resentence defendant on May 4, 2000, by its restitution order. 98 H. 137 (App.), 44 P.3d 288 (2002).\n\nWhere defendant's term of probation had already ended when the State charged defendant with criminal contempt for violating the no-contact condition of probation, and the State failed to take any steps during defendant's probation to revoke, modify or enlarge its terms and thereby toll the period of probation, the district court no longer had jurisdiction to revoke defendant's probation or modify or enlarge its terms; thus, by convicting defendant of criminal contempt as a sanction for a probation violation, the court essentially extended defendant's probation term for two years, which was inconsistent with this section. 120 H. 312 (App.), 205 P.3d 577 (2009).\n\n§706-630 Commentary:\n\n1.

As § §706-625 and 628 indicate, the conditions of suspension or probation may be modified or the disposition itself may be revoked. These features of suspension or probation are, of course, necessary in order that the sentencing authority can maintain control over the disposition. However, merely because the sentencing court maintains some continuing flexibility with respect to the disposition, the conviction and disposition should not be regarded as lacking finality for other purposes such as constituting a judgment for purposes of appeal and a prior conviction for purposes of extended imprisonment.\n\nThis section, therefore, provides that a suspension of sentence or sentence to probation shall be deemed tentative to the extent provided in chapter 706, but for all other purposes such disposition shall constitute a final judgment.",

The fine imposed shall be the greater of double the value of the stolen property received or $25,000 in the case of a conviction for theft in the first degree; or the greater of double the value of the stolen property received or $10,000 in the case of a conviction for theft in the second degree. The mandatory fines imposed by this subsection shall not be reduced except and only to the extent that payment of the fine prevents the defendant from making restitution to the victim of the offense, or that the defendant's property, real or otherwise, has been forfeited under chapter 712A as a result of the same conviction for which the defendant is being fined under this subsection.

The maximum amount provided should be sufficient for both deterrent and correctional purposes; discretion in imposing a fine within the set maximum should be guided by the criteria set forth in §706-641.\n\nThe most significant use of the fine as a means of penalizing the offender is in offenses involving pecuniary gain. When the amount of pecuniary gain is proven, subsection (5) subordinates the stated amounts and authorizes a greater fine in an amount equal to double the pecuniary gain.\n\nSubsection (6) acknowledges that other higher or lower fines may be authorized with respect to specific offenses when deemed necessary or appropriate to the situation. Subsection (6) also preserves and recognizes higher and lower limits for offenses which are set by provisions of law not within the Penal Code.\n\nBecause of the questionable wisdom and constitutionality of authorizing the disposition of assessing costs against convicted defendants in criminal cases, the Code departs from prior Hawaii law and does not authorize such a sentence. As a practical matter, costs are almost never imposed in criminal cases. The departure is from previous statutory language rather than practice.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-640\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, increased the maximum amounts of fines to allow a sentencing court discretion to impose severe fines, especially when the offender derives great financial gain from the criminal activity.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §34]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-641\n\nThis section states the general position of the Code against the routine imposition of fines where other types of disposition are authorized. Even in the case of violations, where only a fine or suspended sentence is authorized, the fine imposed should be measured in terms of the defendant's ability to pay and in terms of the defendant's ability to make compensation to the victims, if any, of the defendant's offense.\n\nWhere other types of disposition are available, the court should not impose only a fine unless the court makes a determination that \"a fine alone suffices for the protection of the public.\"\n\nMore is required of the court in order to impose both imprisonment and a fine or probation and a fine upon a defendant. The court is authorized by subsection (2) to impose such a sentence only if the defendant derived pecuniary gain from the crime or the court is of the opinion that a fine (in addition to imprisonment or probation) will serve either a correctional or deterrent function.\n\nSubsection (3)(a) seeks to eliminate fines which the defendant cannot pay. Incarceration should not result from mere inability to pay an imposed fine. Contumacious non-payment is quite another thing and is handled in subsequent sections. Subsection (3)(b) seeks to prevent the imposition of a fine which would interfere with restitution or reparation to the victim.\n\nSubsection (4) instructs the court to consider the defendant's financial resources with respect to the fine's amount and its method of payment (lump sum or installment payments).\n\nThe Code differs from prior law in that it ends the possibility of imprisonment for noncontumacious failure to make payment.1 It also supplies legislative guidelines previously absent from the law.\n\nWhere defendant was sentenced pursuant to §431:10C-117(a)(2), because the district court may have been unaware of the applicability of quoted parts of this section and §706-642 and of its discretionary authority to sentence defendant to perform community service rather than to pay the fine, appellate court vacated the part of the sentence ordering defendant to pay a $1,000 fine and remanded that part for resentencing. 77 H. 476 (App.), 888 P.2d 376 (1995).\n\n§706-641 Commentary:\n\n1.

Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2085.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) to require the defendant to pay a fine to the cashier or clerk of the district or circuit court, instead of the clerk of the sentencing court.\n\nAct 149, Session Laws 2009, established an insurance fraud investigations branch to replace the insurance fraud investigations unit, with expanded authority to prevent, investigate, and prosecute insurance fraud to include all lines of insurance except workers' compensation. Act 149 amended subsection (2), requiring the deposit of fines and settlements resulting from insurance fraud prosecutions into the compliance resolution fund to help the insurance fraud investigations branch cover the cost of preventing, investigating, and prosecuting insurance fraud. The legislature found that because insurance fraud occurs in every line of insurance, the State's insurance fraud law should be expanded accordingly. Conference Committee Report No. 26, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1338.\n\nAct 196, Session Laws 2021, amended this section to clarify that the director of finance shall transmit the fines imposed on offenders convicted of certain offenses involving operation of a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant to the state drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory special fund. The legislature found that driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol continues to be a major safety issue in the State. However, the prosecution of arrested and suspected drivers impaired by drugs and alcohol was costly because blood and urine samples for drug analyses were sent to mainland laboratories for analysis. The legislature further found that in addition to being costly, this process was lengthy and could result in case dismissals. Accordingly, Act 196 established the state drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory special fund to sustain a drug and alcohol laboratory in the State. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1158, House Standing Committee Report No. 750.\n\nAct 148, Session Laws 2023, amended this section to replace references to: (1) \"state drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory special fund\" with \"drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory special fund\" to reflect the expanded scope of the laboratory; and (2) \"section 291E-61(b)(2)(C)\" with \"section 291E-61(b)(2)(E).\" Act 148 also extended to June 30, 2028, the sunset date of section 7 of Act 196, Session Laws 2021, which amended this section by requiring the director of finance to transmit fines to the drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory special fund. The legislature found that the safety of all roadway users was of paramount importance. The Department of Health did not have enough resources to fulfill the increased need for blood alcohol testing across the State. Additionally, the emergency services department of the city and county of Honolulu processed all alcohol blood level tests for the entire State, including tests for suspected cases of driving under the influence. As such, the legislature noted that establishing a drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory would provide law enforcement personnel and adjudicators with the resources necessary to protect the public from impaired drivers.

      "text": "§706-644 Consequences of nonpayment; imprisonment for contumacious nonpayment; summary collection.(1) When a defendant is sentenced pursuant to section 706-605, granted a conditional discharge pursuant to section 712-1255, or granted a deferred plea pursuant to chapter 853, and the defendant is ordered to pay a fee, fine, or restitution, whether as an independent order, as part of a judgment and sentence, or as a condition of probation or deferred plea, and the defendant defaults in the payment thereof or of any installment, the court, upon the motion of the prosecuting attorney or upon its own motion, may require the defendant to show cause why the defendant's default should not be treated as contumacious and may issue a summons or a warrant of arrest for the defendant's appearance. Unless the defendant shows that the defendant's default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court, or to a failure on the defendant's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for the payment, the court shall find that the defendant's default was contumacious and may order the defendant committed until the fee, fine, restitution, or a specified part thereof is paid.\n\n(2) When a fee, fine, or restitution is imposed on a corporation or unincorporated association, it is the duty of the person or persons authorized to make disbursement from the assets of the corporation or association to pay it from those assets, and their failure to do so may be held contumacious unless they make the showing required in subsection (1).\n\n(3) The term of imprisonment for nonpayment of fee, fine, or restitution shall be specified in the order of commitment, and shall not exceed one day for each $250 of the fee or fine, thirty days if the fee or fine was imposed upon conviction of a violation or a petty misdemeanor, or one year in any other case, whichever is the shorter period. A person committed for nonpayment of a fee or fine shall be given credit toward payment of the fee or fine for each day of imprisonment, at the rate of $250 per day.\n\n(4) If it appears that the defendant's default in the payment of a fee, fine, or restitution is not contumacious, the court may make an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking the fee, fine, or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in part, or converting the unpaid portion of the fee or fine to community service. A defendant shall not be discharged from an order to pay restitution until the full amount of the restitution has actually been collected or accounted for.\n\n(5) Unless discharged by payment or, in the case of a fee or fine, service of imprisonment pursuant to subsection (3), an order to pay a fee, fine, or restitution, whether as an independent order, as a part of a judgment and sentence, or as a condition of probation or deferred plea pursuant to chapter 853, may be collected in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action. The State or the victim named in the order may collect the restitution, including costs, interest, and attorney's fees, pursuant to section 706-646. The State may collect the fee or fine, including costs, interest, and attorney's fees pursuant to section 706-647.\n\n(6) Attorney's fees, costs, and interest shall not be deemed part of the penalty, and no person shall be imprisoned under this section in default of payment of attorney's fees, costs, and interest. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §36; gen ch 1992; am L 1996, c 137, §2; am L 1998, c 269, §6; am L 2000, c 205, §6; am L 2021, c 81, §4]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-644\n\nThe Code equates a fine with a court-imposed civil obligation in favor of the State. Thus the contempt power is utilized to enforce that obligation. Subsection (1) provides that the court may summon the defendant, or issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest, and order the defendant to show cause why the defendant's failure to pay the fine should not be regarded by the court as contumacious. If the defendant cannot, the defendant will be imprisoned as in the cases of civil contempt.\n\nIn the case of convicted corporations or unincorporated associations, subsection (2) places a similar duty to pay, or to justify default of payment, on the officer or agent of a corporation or unincorporated association authorized to distribute its assets.\n\nSubsection (3) sets the limit on the period of imprisonment for contumacious nonpayment of fines. The terms are intended to be coercive, but not debilitating. The credit allowed is the same as that under previous law.[1]\n\nSubsection (4) permits the court to take a flexible approach to noncontumacious default. The court may lower the amount of each payment or may revoke the fine in whole or in part.\n\nSubsection (5) makes clear that all the processes for collection of an unpaid civil judgment are available for collection of a fine. This subsection is in accord with prior law.2\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-644\n\nAct 137, Session Laws 1996, amended this section to provide that fines and costs may be collected in the same manner as a civil judgment, and that the state attorney general may institute proceedings to collect the fine and costs, including interest and attorney's fees, as a civil judgment in the court of appropriate jurisdiction. The legislature found that the Act (which also amended the traffic code by enacting a new section with similar provisions) would assist the judiciary in collecting fines and costs imposed in traffic and criminal cases. The Act also deleted the first sentence of subsection (5) to remove potential conflict between existing law and the provisions of the Act. House Standing Committee Report No. 379-96, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2987.\n\nAct 269, Session Laws 1998, amended this section by, among other things, allowing victims of crime to enforce a criminal restitution order in the same manner as a civil judgment. Conference Committee Report No. 89.\n\nAct 205, Session Laws 2000, amended this section by adding that the nonpayment of any fees, in addition to the nonpayment of any fine or restitution ordered by a court, would be subject to the penalties and consequences imposed under this section.\n\nAct 81, Session Laws 2021, amended this section to: (1) modify the ratio of imprisonment term to contumacious nonpayment, from a maximum of one day for each $25 of a fee or fine, to a maximum of one day for each $250 of a fee or fine; and (2) increase the amount of credit given to a person committed for contumacious nonpayment, from $25 per day to $250 per day. The legislature found that the financial hardship task force, established pursuant to Act 112, Session Laws 2019, made several recommendations to address the needs of traffic offenders who are experiencing financial hardship. Act 81 implemented several recommendations from the task force. Conference Committee Report No. 76, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1091.\n\nProvision relating to imprisonment for contumacious nonpayment mentioned. 60 H. 160, 587 P.2d 1220 (1978).\n\nFrom and after July 20, 1998, the amended provisions of this section statutorily provide for free standing orders of restitution (FSOs) to be imposed, inter alia, as a condition of probation; where original sentence of defendant on March 29, 1995, made restitution a condition of probation, restitution could not later be ordered as an FSO pursuant to this section. 103 H. 269, 81 P.3d 1184 (2003).\n\nWhere a case predates July 20, 1998, the effective date of amendments to this section, a free standing order of restitution (FSO) could have been separately and independently imposed at the time of a defendant's original sentencing, in addition to any other sentence such as probation or imprisonment; however, an FSO could not be imposed as a modification of a probation condition, or as a new term of probation following revocation, or otherwise. 103 H. 269, 81 P.3d 1184 (2003).\n\nMentioned: 55 H. 632, 525 P.2d 1119 (1974).\n\n§706-644 Commentary:\n\n1.

      "text": "§706-646 Victim restitution.(1) As used in this section, \"victim\" includes any of the following:\n\n(a) The direct victim of a crime including a business entity, trust, or governmental entity;\n\n(b) If the victim dies as a result of the crime, a surviving relative of the victim as defined in chapter 351;\n\n(c) A governmental entity that has reimbursed the victim for losses arising as a result of the crime or paid for medical care provided to the victim as a result of the crime; or\n\n(d) Any duly incorporated humane society or duly incorporated society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, contracted with the county or State to enforce animal-related statutes or ordinances, that impounds, holds, or receives custody of a pet animal pursuant to section 711-1109.1, 711-1109.2, or 711-1110.5; provided that this section does not apply to costs that have already been contracted and provided for by the counties or State.\n\n(2) The court shall order the defendant to make restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by the victim or victims as a result of the defendant's offense when requested by the victim. The court shall order restitution to be paid to the crime victim compensation commission if the victim has been given an award for compensation under chapter 351. If the court orders payment of a fine in addition to restitution or a compensation fee, or both, the payment of restitution and compensation fee shall be made pursuant to section 706-651.\n\n(3) In ordering restitution, the court shall not consider the defendant's financial ability to make restitution in determining the amount of restitution to order. The court, however, shall consider the defendant's financial ability to make restitution for the purpose of establishing the time and manner of payment. The court shall specify the time and manner in which restitution is to be paid. While the defendant is in the custody of the department of corrections and rehabilitation, restitution shall be collected pursuant to chapter 353 and any court-ordered payment schedule shall be suspended. Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses, including but not limited to:\n\n(a) Full value of stolen or damaged property, as determined by replacement costs of like property, or the actual or estimated cost of repair, if repair is possible;\n\n(b) Medical expenses, which shall include mental health treatment, counseling, and therapy;\n\n(c) Funeral and burial expenses; and\n\n(d) Lost earnings, which shall include paid leave.\n\n(4) In any criminal proceeding before any court, all money deposited by the defendant as bail and not declared forfeited shall be applied toward payment of any restitution, fines, or fees ordered by the court in the same case, consistent with the priorities in subsection (2).\n\n(5) The restitution ordered shall not affect the right of a victim to recover under section 351-33 or in any manner provided by law; provided that any amount of restitution actually recovered by the victim under this section shall be deducted from any award under section 351-33. [L 1998, c 269, pt of §1; am L 1999, c 18, §17; am L 2006, c 230, §22; am L 2012, c 211, §5; am L 2013, c 207, §1; am L 2016, c 231, §25; am L 2017, c 77, §4; am L 2019, c 108, §2; am L 2022, c 278, §29]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-646\n\nAct 269, Session Laws 1998, added this section and §706-647 to allow victims of crime to enforce a criminal restitution order in the same manner as a civil judgment. This section also includes within the definition of \"victim\" a governmental entity which has reimbursed the victim for losses arising as a result of the crime, and allows the court to order restitution to be paid to the criminal injuries compensation commission if the victim has been given an award for compensation by the commission. Under current law, a defendant may be required by the court to pay restitution for losses caused to the victim. Collection of the restitution was left to governmental entities such as the judiciary, paroling authority, and department of public safety; these entities often were able to collect only a small fraction of the amount. Moreover, although the criminal injuries compensation commission helped victims by providing some compensation, victims of property crimes and some violent crimes were ineligible for any compensation from the commission. Furthermore, although a victim may bring a civil action against the defendant, the process was costly and time-consuming. The legislature believed that victims should have a \"fast track\" ability to be compensated for their losses by allowing victims to enforce the criminal restitution order as a civil judgment, using all of the civil collection remedies. Conference Committee Report No. 89, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3008.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among other things, require that when restitution is ordered, the amount ordered is not based on the defendant's financial ability to make restitution, but the defendant's financial ability to make restitution [shall] be considered in establishing the time and manner of payment. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 211, Session Laws 2012, amended this section by making a conforming amendment to include medical assistance provided by the State as an expense for which restitution may be ordered to conform with amendments made to other sections in the Hawaii Revised Statutes by Act 211. The legislature found that the medicaid program's ability to recover moneys from third parties to which it was entitled must be strengthened to maintain the viability of the medicaid program. Act 211 would assist the medicaid program in recovering those moneys, thereby reducing the burden on the program imposed by third parties and helping to ensure that the program is sustainable. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3314.\n\nAct 207, Session Laws 2013, amended subsection (1) by expanding the definition of \"victim\" to: (1) include duly incorporated humane societies or duly incorporated societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, contracted with the county or State, in order to provide those societies with restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered; and (2) provide that duly incorporated humane societies or duly incorporated societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, contracted with the county or State, should not receive restitution as a victim for costs that have already been contracted and provided for by the counties or State. The legislature found that in a recent decision, the circuit court of the first circuit denied restitution to the Hawaiian Humane Society for their expenses incurred in caring for one hundred fifty-three dogs previously subjected to animal cruelty in the second degree. The court held that the Hawaiian Humane Society was not a government agency or a \"direct victim\" of the crime committed. Although the Hawaiian Humane Society assumed care of the dogs and became the legal owner of all of the dogs upon forfeiture proceedings, the court held that it was not the \"actual owner\" and was not entitled to restitution under this section. Act 207 provided clear language to allow any duly incorporated humane society contracted with a county or State to receive restitution for expenses incurred when caring for an animal as a result of animal forfeiture or impoundment. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1294, Conference Committee Report No. 19.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsections (2) and (3) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 77, Session Laws 2017, amended this section by requiring that any bail posted by a defendant be applied toward payment of any court-ordered restitution, fines, or fees in the same case. The legislature recognized concerns raised by the [city and county of Honolulu] department of the prosecuting attorney concerning the ineffectiveness of §10 of Act 139, Session Laws 2012 amending §353-22.6 \"Victim restitution\", in facilitating the payment of restitution to crime victims since a vast majority of offenders owing restitution are not in prison. The legislature found that Act 77 established additional mechanisms to increase offender accountability and secure restitution payments to crime victims. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 956, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1523, Conference Committee Report No. 33.\n\nAct 108, Session Laws 2019, amended this section to clarify that restitution payments to crime victims may include reimbursements for mental health treatment, counseling, therapy, and lost earnings, including paid leave. The legislature found that an ambiguity existed as to what losses are eligible for reimbursement to crime victims. The legislature further found that losses suffered by crime victims can include the cost of damaged or stolen property and hospitalization, as well as lost earnings and the cost of mental health treatment. Act 108 made a broader range of losses eligible for reimbursement in order for crime victims to be made as whole as possible. Conference Committee Report No. 36.\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to replace references to \"department of public safety\" with \"department of corrections and rehabilitation\" to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation. The legislature further found that reorganizing certain state law enforcement functions into a single entity with consistent training opportunities would allow for the efficient use of resources in administering correctional programs and improve decision making, promote accountability, streamline communication, decrease costs, reduce duplication of efforts, provide uniform training and standards, and promote uniform standards of law enforcement services. House Standing Committee Report No. 200-22, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3292.\n\nThis section permits restitution for reasonable and verified lost wages in appropriate circumstances, given that: (1) the limitations set forth in subsection (2) did not limit the categories of restitution that were compensable and contained no language that would exclude lost wages; (2) an award that did not include reasonable and verified income lost as a result of the defendant's unlawful conduct would not reimburse a victim \"fully\" for losses, as required by subsection (3); (3) the categories of losses enumerated in the illustrative list in subsection (3) were not the only categories of losses recoverable pursuant to the statutory scheme; (4) verified lost wages were routinely grouped with and similar in kind to the verified pecuniary losses illustrated in subsection (3); (5) restitution for reasonable and verified lost wages was in accordance with the legislature's underlying purpose to provide restitution for victims who were ineligible for crime victim compensation commission compensation; and (6) such restitution would not place an unreasonable administrative burden on trial courts. 136 H. 193, 361 P.3d 420 (2015).\n\nDefendant's argument that a crime victim who received indemnification from an insurer did not suffer a \"loss\" within the meaning of this section was without merit; the only exception for or reduction of restitution plainly stated in this section is that any amount actually recovered by the victim from the criminal should be deducted from the amount the victim might recover from the crime victim compensation special fund pursuant to §351-33. 121 H. 135 (App.), 214 P.3d 1125 (2009).\n\nTrial court properly ordered defendant to repay the full amount of losses to employer without reduction for amounts paid by insurance, which furthered the rehabilitative purposes of this section to the greatest extent possible; if defendant was not required to pay any restitution, defendant would not have righted the wrong defendant committed and no rehabilitative purpose would be achieved; the interests of justice would not be served by allowing a thief to retain or otherwise benefit from the spoils of the thief's crime simply because the thief picked a victim who was prudent enough to have obtained insurance. 121 H. 135 (App.), 214 P.3d 1125 (2009).\n\nWhere defendant was ordered to pay restitution to employer, the direct victim of defendant's crime, not employer's insurer, defendant's sentence complied with subsection (1). 121 H. 135 (App.), 214 P.3d 1125 (2009).\n\nWhere (1) traffic accident victim, and not defendant, caused the accident, (2) it appeared that victim's vehicle flipped over on its roof causing victim's immediate death upon impact, and (3) there was no evidence in the record that defendant's criminal misconduct of failing to remain at the scene of the accident, provide information, and render reasonable assistance pursuant to § §291C-12 and 291C-14 caused victim's injuries or death, no nexus between defendant's conduct and victim's injuries and death had been demonstrated; thus, restitution could not be imposed under this section. 121 H. 191 (App.), 216 P.3d 117 (2009).\n\nDistrict court erred by ordering defendant to pay restitution for victim's lost wages under subsection (3); restitution for wage loss was contrary to the legislative intent behind this section, and thus, lost wages were not compensable as restitution. 130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033 (2013).\n\nIn light of this section's requirement that the restitution amount be \"reasonable and verified\" and that the victim is in the best position to provide information regarding and verification of his or her losses caused by the defendant, where restitution is contested, the burden to present a prima facie showing regarding restitution request is best placed on the prosecution who brings the restitution motion on behalf of the victim of the crime. 130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033 (2013).\n\nPortion of restitution award for medical expenses vacated and remanded where district court found there was a basis in evidence to conclude defendant caused injury and resultant expenses to victim, while recognizing that victim had a preexisting neck condition and had been receiving treatment, but ruled no apportionment was possible where no expert medical opinion or competent medical evidence was presented; conclusion was at odds with the court's findings regarding the worsening of the victim's condition and consequential change in victim's medical treatment and based on a misconception that imposition of all medical expenses could be made on defendant where there was insufficient evidence upon which to base an apportionment. 130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033 (2013).",

House Standing Committee Report No. 176-04.\n\nAct 295, Session Laws 2012, amended this section to authorize the courts to assess a fee for probation services to all offenders under the supervision of the adult client services branch, including those granted deferred acceptance of guilty plea or deferred acceptance of nolo contendere plea, to hold offenders accountable for their actions and make them responsible for paying for some of their supervision costs. The legislature found that in 2000, it established probation services fees to help defray the costs of administering probation services. However, this fee could not be ordered for those offenders who are granted deferrals. Act 295 would allow the courts to collect probation services fees from offenders placed on deferral to make them accountable for their actions and to help pay for their supervision costs, and addressed the Judiciary's need for additional revenue to meet the rising costs of supervising offenders that are not covered by the general fund.

The legislature felt that the court should have the discretion to determine when the circumstances of the murder justify the enhanced sentence, and that this discretion should be limited to those situations demonstrating exceptional depravity. House Standing Committee Report No. 1171, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 689.\n\nAct 202, Session Laws 2014, amended subsection (1) by applying a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole to persons eighteen years of age or over at the time of the offense who are convicted of first degree murder or first degree attempted murder; and requiring that persons under eighteen years of age at the time of the offense who are convicted of first degree murder or first degree attempted murder are sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. The legislature found that Hawaii is one of the few states that still allow life sentences without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. International law prohibits life sentence without parole for juvenile offenders under the age of eighteen at the time the crime is committed. The United States is the only country in the world that sentences its children to a lifetime of incarceration. In Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court held that mandatory life sentences without parole for those under the age of eighteen at the time of their crimes violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. The legislature also recognized that mitigating factors may exist for cases involving a juvenile offender. In Miller, the Supreme Court stated that youth is a moment and \"condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.\" Therefore, the legislature encouraged the sentencing judge to take into account and consider any mitigating factors for cases involving a juvenile offender. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3248, Conference Committee Report No. 56-14.\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to replace references to \"director of public safety\" with \"director of corrections and rehabilitation\" to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation. The legislature further found that reorganizing certain state law enforcement functions into a single entity with consistent training opportunities would allow for the efficient use of resources in administering correctional programs and improve decision making, promote accountability, streamline communication, decrease costs, reduce duplication of efforts, provide uniform training and standards, and promote uniform standards of law enforcement services.

As used in this section, the phrase \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity\" means a conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to a victim and \"previously convicted\" means a sentence imposed at the same time or a sentence previously imposed which has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated.\n\nHearings to determine the grounds for imposing an enhanced sentence for second degree murder may be initiated by the prosecutor or by the court on its own motion.

The legislature felt that this discretion should be limited to those situations in which the circumstances demonstrate that the individual who committed the crime is exceptionally depraved, and therefore should receive the enhanced sentence. House Standing Committee Report No. 1171, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 689.\n\nAct 15, Session Laws 1996, amended this section to provide that a court may sentence a person convicted of murder in the second degree to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, if the person had a prior conviction for murder. The Act addressed the problem encountered by the prosecution in Briones v. State, 74 H. 442 (1993), in attempting to obtain a conviction of the defendant for murder in the first degree for killing two persons. The supreme court held in Briones v. State that the defendant must have had the prior intent or state of mind to kill two persons before the defendant killed the first person, for a conviction for murder in the first degree, which has a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. The legislature's intent was to permit a court to sentence a defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole when the defendant commits two or more murders. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2592, House Standing Committee Report No. 221-96.\n\nAct 202, Session Laws 2014, amended this section to apply the sentencing guidelines under the section to persons eighteen years of age or over at the time of the offense. The legislature found that Hawaii is one of the few states that still allow life sentences without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. International law prohibits life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders under the age of eighteen at the time the crime is committed. The United States is the only country in the world that sentences its children to a lifetime of incarceration. In Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court held that mandatory life sentences without parole for those under the age of eighteen at the time of their crimes violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. The Supreme Court reasoned that children are constitutionally different from adults for sentencing purposes, and because juveniles have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform, they are less deserving of the most severe punishments. The Supreme Court concluded that the distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes. Act 202 recognized the constitutional differences relating to sentencing between juvenile and adult offenders by eliminating the sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3248, Conference Committee Report No. 56-14.\n\nThe findings necessary to impose an enhanced sentence under this section must be made by the trier of fact; if the prosecution elects to seek an enhanced sentence pursuant to this section, it must be alleged in the complaint. 92 H. 19, 986 P.2d 306 (1999).\n\nSection requires State to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the victim suffered unnecessary torture and that the defendant intentionally or knowingly inflicted unnecessary torture upon the victim; \"unnecessary torture\" means the infliction of extreme physical or mental suffering, beyond that which necessarily accompanies the underlying killing. 93 H. 224, 999 P.2d 230 (2000).\n\nTrial court erred in imposing enhanced sentence under this section where court's findings of fact regarding whether victim screamed or incurred defensive wounds were clearly erroneous and there was no substantial evidence that victim suffered unnecessary torture. 93 H. 224, 999 P.2d 230 (2000).\n\nJury's findings whether murder was \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity\"; unanimity requirement clarified. 95 H. 1, 18 P.3d 203 (2001).\n\nSection not unconstitutionally vague as section provides adequate guidance to a fact-finder charged with determining whether a murder was \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity\" and provides adequate notice to the person of ordinary intelligence that an enhanced sentence may be imposed if he or she intentionally or knowingly inflicts unnecessary torture on the murder victim and the victim in fact suffers unnecessary torture. 95 H. 1, 18 P.3d 203 (2001).",

The legislature stated: \"Your Committee feels that the seriousness of class A felonies...merits mandatory imprisonment. This bill effects this purpose by denying suspension of sentence and probation as sentencing options in class A convictions, but retains, through indeterminate sentence, the option of parole by the paroling authority in order that unusual extenuating circumstances can be given due consideration.\" Senate Standing Committee Report No. 965-80.\n\nAct 229, Session Laws 1994, amended this section, inter alia, to allow the court to make an exception for a person convicted of a class A felony defined in chapter 712, part IV, from the mandatory sentence of an indeterminate term of imprisonment without the possibility of suspension of sentence or probation. The legislature believed that, in certain instances, the public is better served by allowing judges some discretion in evaluating all appropriate sentencing and treatment alternatives available for drug offenders.

The legislature noted that traffic related fatalities were a serious issue and that persons convicted of certain offenses involving traffic fatalities should be dealt with accordingly. The legislature found that Act 292 provided clarity regarding the imposition of a term of imprisonment, as a condition for probation, for a person convicted of manslaughter, and makes this section consistent with §706-620(2), which allows for a sentence of probation for an offense of manslaughter.

Assuming care is used in designating the grade and class of each offense, this should go a long way in ameliorating the variety of inconsistent sentences previously authorized.\n\nIn 1965, the legislature enacted a law designed to end judicially imposed inconsistent sentences of imprisonment.[1] This policy known as true indeterminate sentencing is continued. The court's discretion is limited to choosing between imprisonment and other modes of sentencing. Once the court has decided to sentence a felon to imprisonment, the actual time of release is determined by parole authorities. Having decided on imprisonment, the court must then impose the maximum term authorized.[2] The concept is accepted in California[3] and is being proposed in Michigan.[4] This policy is also in substantial accord with the proposed A.B.A. Standards on sentencing.[5]\n\nInevitably, there will remain some disparity arising from the fact that some judges will be more strongly inclined toward granting probation (or other non-imprisonment disposition) than others. The criteria set forth in part II of this chapter, for withholding a sentence of imprisonment, are intended to alleviate this disparity somewhat. Moreover, §706-669, governing the procedure for determining the actual minimum time to be served, provides that the parole board must make an initial determination as soon as practicable but, in any event, no later than six months following commitment. Thus, \"[g]rossly inappropriate denial[s] of probation can in most instances be cured fairly promptly through parole, if the circumstances favoring release are evident....\"[6]\n\nFinally, this section embodies a policy of differentiating exceptional problems calling for extended terms of imprisonment[7] from the problems which the vast majority of offenders present. Most of the felony sentences previously authorized in Hawaii were clearly intended to encompass the most dangerous offender. The uniform application of a sentence designed to encompass exceptional cases seems clearly unwarranted in the cases presented by the vast majority of offenders. This is borne out by the A.B.A.'s recent study:\n\n...[M]any sentences authorized by statute in this country are, by comparison to other countries and in terms of the needs of the public, excessively long for the vast majority of cases. Their length is undoubtedly the product of concern for protection against the most exceptional cases, most notably the particularly dangerous offender and the professional criminal. It would be more desirable for the penal code to differentiate explicitly between most offenders and such exceptional cases, by providing lower, more realistic sentences for the former and authorizing a special term for the latter.[8]\n\nThe sentences provided in this section, when compared to the extended sentences authorized in subsequent sections, seek to achieve the recommended explicit differentiation.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-660\n\nAct 204, Session Laws 1976, amended the first sentence by adding the exception excluding persons convicted of felonies involving firearms. In its report, the Conference Committee states that it \"intends to require the court in cases of felonies where a firearm was used to impose a mandatory term of imprisonment\" and that nothing contained in the bill \"should be construed as precluding (a) the court from imposing an indeterminate sentence or an extended indeterminate sentence, or (b) the Hawaii paroling authority from fixing the minimum term of imprisonment at a length greater than the term of imprisonment provided for in this bill 706-660.1.\" Conference Committee Report Nos. 34 and 35.\n\nAct 294, Session Laws 1980, restricted this section to sentences for class B and C felonies, eliminating provisions relating to class A felonies. For class A felonies, see §706-659.\n\nAct 280, Session Laws 2013, amended this section by granting a sentencing court the discretion to sentence a defendant convicted of a class B or class C felony drug offense to a prison sentence of a length appropriate to the defendant's particular offense and underlying circumstances. Specifically, this Act allows a court to impose a sentence of imprisonment for certain class B felonies for not less than five years, and a sentence of imprisonment for certain class C felonies for not less than one year. The legislature found that state mandatory minimum sentencing laws are being challenged across the nation because these laws mandate longer prison sentences regardless of whether the sentencing court believes the punishment is appropriate based on the circumstances and facts of the case. Studies have shown that mandatory minimum sentencing of drug users causes an increase in incarceration costs and have a disproportionate impact on women and certain racial and ethnic groups. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 496, House Standing Committee Report No. 1464.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (2) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nBecause criminal solicitation to commit first degree murder is a crime declared to be a felony without specification of class within meaning of §706-610, it is a class C felony for sentencing purposes, subject to the sentencing provisions of this section. 84 H. 229, 933 P.2d 66 (1997).\n\nFor sentencing purposes, conspiracy to commit second degree murder is a class C felony under §706-610 and subject to the sentencing provisions of this section, not §706-656. 84 H. 280, 933 P.2d 617 (1997).\n\nWhere defendant was convicted by the jury of five first-degree thefts, each of which defendant was sentenced to ten years' incarceration, and pursuant to this section and §706-668.5, five ten-year terms running consecutively was the statutory maximum, defendant's sentence did not deprive defendant of defendant's right to a jury trial as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in Apprendi and Blakely. 111 H. 267, 141 P.3d 440 (2006).\n\nUpon revocation of probation pursuant to §706-625(3), in light of the record, §706-621 and this section, trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to imprisonment \"for a term of not more than ten years with credit for time served\". 97 H. 135 (App.), 34 P.3d 1034 (2001).\n\nCited: 56 H. 628, 548 P.2d 632 (1976).\n\n§706-660 Commentary:\n\n1. See H.R.S. §711-76.\n\n2. It must, however, be remembered that the Code grants the court the power to impose an extended term of imprisonment (see §706-661).\n\n3. Cal. Pen. Code §1168.\n\n4. Prop.

Nothing in this or in §706-660, however, is intended to preclude the court from imposing indeterminate or extended indeterminate sentences, or the paroling authority from fixing minimum terms of imprisonment, exceeding the terms provided for in this section. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 35, House Conference Committee Report No. 34 (1976).\n\nAct 260, Session Laws 1987, amended this section by changing the conditions under which a mandatory sentence can be imposed. A mandatory sentence can be imposed regardless of whether the firearm was loaded, operable, or used as a threat. The legislature felt that allowing judicial discretion in imposing a mandatory sentence, for the first firearm offense, will address concerns that under certain circumstances the mere possession of a firearm may not justify a mandatory prison term.

Nothing in this section precludes the introduction of victim-related data to establish dangerousness in accord with the Hawaii rules of evidence;\n\n(4) The defendant is a multiple offender in that:\n\n(a) The defendant is being sentenced for two or more felonies or is already under sentence of imprisonment for any felony; or\n\n(b) The maximum terms of imprisonment authorized for each of the defendant's crimes, if made to run consecutively, would equal or exceed in length the maximum of the extended term imposed or would equal or exceed forty years if the extended term imposed is for a class A felony;\n\n(5) The defendant is an offender against the elderly, handicapped, or a minor eight years of age or younger in that:\n\n(a) The defendant attempts or commits any of the following crimes: murder, manslaughter, a sexual offense that constitutes a felony under chapter 707, robbery, felonious assault, burglary, or kidnapping; and\n\n(b) The defendant, in the course of committing or attempting to commit the crime, inflicts serious or substantial bodily injury upon a person who has the status of being:\n\n(i) Sixty years of age or older;\n\n(ii) Blind, a paraplegic, or a quadriplegic; or\n\n(iii) Eight years of age or younger; and\n\nthe person's status is known or reasonably should be known to the defendant;\n\n(6) The defendant is a hate crime offender in that:\n\n(a) The defendant is convicted of a crime under chapter 707, 708, or 711; and\n\n(b) The defendant intentionally selected a victim or, in the case of a property crime, the property that was the object of a crime, because of hostility toward the actual or perceived race, religion, disability, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation of any person. For purposes of this subsection, \"gender identity or expression\" includes a person's actual or perceived gender, as well as a person's gender identity, gender-related self-image, gender-related appearance, or gender-related expression, regardless of whether that gender identity, gender-related self-image, gender-related appearance, or gender-related expression is different from that traditionally associated with the person's sex at birth; or\n\n(7) The defendant is convicted under section 707-702.5 and the defendant did not remain at the scene of the crime and render reasonable assistance to an injured person, including acts and omissions in violation of section 291C-12.

New Jersey required a jury to make the finding. 436 F.3d 1057 (2006).\n\nWhere the district court had granted relief on petitioner's claim that the enhancement of petitioner's sentence based on judge-found facts violated Apprendi, the State's failure to object and its affirmative invitation that the district court adopt the magistrate's recommendation constituted waiver of its challenge to petitioner's Apprendi claim. 825 F.3d 1103 (2016).\n\nPetitioner's extended sentence, based on judge-determined facts, violated Apprendi v.

Washington, as (1) Blakely addresses only statutory \"determinate\" sentencing \"guideline\" schemes, and (2) the Hawaii supreme court's \"intrinsic-extrinsic\" analysis culminating in State v. Kaua is compatible with both Blakely and Apprendi v. New Jersey. 106 H. 146, 102 P.3d 1044 (2004).\n\nTrial court did not err in sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment under this section where it found that (1) defendant was a persistent and multiple offender and (2) that defendant's commitment for an extended term was necessary for the protection of the public. 106 H. 146, 102 P.3d 1044 (2004).\n\nTrial court did not err in sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment as a \"multiple offender\" pursuant to paragraph (4)(a); without this finding that the defendant committed a previous felony, notwithstanding that such an extended term may be considered \"necessary for protection of the public\", a judge would not be authorized to impose it; and extended term sentencing did not run afoul of Sixth Amendment to U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in Apprendi v. New Jersey. 110 H. 79, 129 P.3d 1107 (2006).\n\nInasmuch as this section authorizes the sentencing court to extend a defendant's sentence beyond the \"standard term\" authorized solely by the jury's verdict by requiring the sentencing court, rather than the trier of fact, to make an additional necessity finding that does not fall under Apprendi's prior-or-concurrent-convictions exception, this section is unconstitutional on its face; thus, defendant's extended term sentences imposed by the trial court violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and were illegal. 115 H. 432, 168 P.3d 562 (2007).\n\nInvocation of a court's inherent power to provide process where none exists, by reforming this section (1996) to allow for jury fact-finding did not violate defendant's due process right, where assigning the fact-finding role to the jury would be a procedural, as opposed to a substantive, change that would not expand the scope of criminal liability, increase punishment, or alter any evidentiary burdens to defendant's detriment, but, rather, would simply change the course to a result. 117 H. 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).\n\nThe constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures was not offended by the plain language of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d, amending § §706-661, 706-664, and this section regarding sentencing or resentencing for extended terms of imprisonment, where it was clear that the new jury provisions did not (1) increase criminal liability for conduct previously innocent, (2) aggravate the degree of defendant's crimes, (3) increase the punishment available at the time defendant committed defendant's crimes, or (4) alter evidentiary standards to defendant's detriment. 117 H. 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).\n\nWhere enactment of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d provided conclusive expression of legislative support for the use of juries as the trier of fact with respect to extended term sentencing fact-finding, invocation of circuit court's inherent power to reform this section so as to preserve its constitutionality did not unduly burden or substantially interfere with the other branch's exercise of its power. 117 H. 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).\n\nThis section sets forth the facts the jury must find in order to authorize the court to increase the defendant's sentence beyond the statutory maximum for the offense of manslaughter; as the matter of parole was a matter outside the scope of the jury's function, which was limited to finding the two operative facts under this section, it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury on parole. 127 H. 91, 276 P.3d 660 (2012).\n\nThe constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures was not offended by the retrospective application to defendant of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d, amending § §706-661, 706-664, and this section, where Act 1 did not punish as a crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done, make more burdensome the punishment for the crime after its commission, nor deprive one charged with the crime of any defense available according to the law when the act was committed. 118 H. 68 (App.), 185 P.3d 816 (2008).\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §706-661 AND 706-662\n\nThese sections provide for extended terms of imprisonment for the exceptionally difficult defendant. The Code's limited recognition of consecutive sentences, and its attempt to provide lower authorized sentences for the majority of convicted defendants whose records or situations do not suggest the need for extended incarceration, necessitates some provision for dealing with the persistent, professional, dangerous, and multiple offender. Unlike other offenders, these defendants should be subject to possible extended terms because their records or situations indicate that extended incarceration may be necessary to protect the public. In these cases, rehabilitation, if possible, is unlikely to be achieved within an ordinary term.\n\nThe Code takes a flexible approach with respect to extended imprisonment. If one or more of the grounds provided by §706-662 is established, it remains discretionary with the court whether an extended term will be imposed--its imposition is not mandatory.\n\nSection 706-662 authorizes an extended term in the case of (1) a persistent offender, (2) a professional criminal, (3) a dangerous person, and (4) a multiple offender. Subsections (1) through (4) state the minimal requirements for each of the findings. These requirements are not intended as mandates, or even guidelines, but rather as limitations on the court's exercise of discretion.\n\n[T]he existence of the minimal conditions do not make the finding necessary nor is it, indeed, compulsory in any case. Minimal conditions are stated as a safeguard against possible abusive findings, not as a judgment that establishment of the conditions necessarily demands that the finding in question should be made. Of course, before the court can make the ultimate finding required, it must find that the minimal conditions are established.[1]\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §706-661 AND 706-662\n\nAct 210, Session Laws 1978, amended §706-662 by adding paragraph (5), finding offenses against the elderly and the handicapped to be a significant problem.\n\nAct 166, Session Laws 1981, amended §706-662 by deleting the requirement that defendants be at least twenty-two years of age before they become subject to possible extended terms as persistent offenders or professional criminals, it appearing that those most often arrested and sentenced for felonies fell in the eighteen to twenty-five year age group. As amended, the section authorizes the court to impose extended terms, in appropriate cases, regardless of the defendant's age. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 705.\n\nAct 280, Session Laws 1985, amended §706-662 to impose an extended prison term on a defendant who, while committing or attempting to commit certain felony offenses, inflicts serious bodily injury on a person who is blind, paraplegic, quadriplegic, sixty years old or older, or eight years of age or younger. This amendment addresses the needs of persons who cannot protect themselves as well as expresses condemnation of defendants who commit crimes against those persons. House Standing Committee Report No. 398, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 852.\n\nAct 305, Session Laws 1988, amended §706-662 by clarifying the definition of dangerousness by removing old language and using language which conforms more to \"state of the art\" knowledge about violence prediction. The legislature stated that this would lead to an increase in the accuracy of violence prediction by focusing on the two principal components, history of dangerousness and present triggers of violent behavior. This section was also amended to allow the introduction of victim-related data in order to establish dangerousness. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2153.\n\nAct 3, Session Laws 1996, amended §706-662 by adding manslaughter to the crimes for which an extended term of imprisonment may be given when the defendant inflicts serious or substantial bodily injury on a person sixty years or older, handicapped, or eight years or younger. The legislature found that the elderly, handicapped, and children are more vulnerable and should be provided more protection, and that adding manslaughter to the enhanced sentencing statute was consistent with the policy to protect the more vulnerable people in the community. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2036, House Standing Committee Report No. 988-96.\n\nAct 286, Session Laws 1999, amended §706-661 to make the extended term of imprisonment for murder in the second degree an indeterminate life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Conference Committee Report No. 89.\n\nAct 240, Session Laws 2001, amended §706-662 by allowing extended terms of imprisonment for perpetrators of hate-motivated crimes, to protect Hawaii's citizens from crimes motivated by bigotry and hate. House Standing Committee Report No. 1422.\n\nAct 33, Session Laws 2003, amended §706-662, among others, to protect a person's actual or perceived gender identity or expression under the State's current hate crime laws. The legislature found that one child out of two hundred is born with noticeable gender ambiguity, and one child out of one hundred has hidden ambiguity. These persons often struggle with their gender identity and are ridiculed, harassed, and sometimes assaulted by others for being different. The U.S. Department of Justice reports that hate crimes directed against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender citizens are especially violent. \"Sexual orientation,\" currently included in the hate crimes law, is not the same as \"gender identity.\" The legislature believed that this class of persons should be included and afforded protection under Hawaii's hate crime laws. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 593, House Standing Committee Report No. 1184.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §706-661 to require the court to consider public safety in deciding whether to impose an extended term of imprisonment. Act 230 amended §706-662 to clarify that a defendant who has been convicted of a felony qualifies for an extended term of imprisonment under §706-661. Act 230 also provided that the amendments to § §706-661 and 706-662 would sunset on June 30, 2007. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06, Conference Committee Report No. 94-06.\n\nAct 1, Second Special Session Laws 2007, amended Hawaii's extended sentencing statutes, § §706-661, 706-662, and 706-664, to ensure that the procedures used to impose extended terms of imprisonment comply with the requirements of the United States Supreme Court and the Hawaii supreme court. Act 1 required that a jury determine the facts necessary to impose an extended term of imprisonment, unless the defendant waives the right to a jury determination, and that facts necessary to impose an extended term of imprisonment are proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The legislature found that Hawaii's current extended sentencing procedure had been deemed unconstitutional because a judge, rather than a jury, was required to find facts, other than those of prior or concurrent convictions, necessary to enhance a defendant's sentence beyond the ordinary or standard term authorized by the jury's verdict. Act 1's amendments conformed the State's enhanced sentencing law to the requirements of the United States Supreme Court and the Hawaii supreme court. Act 1 applied retroactively to sentencing or resentencing proceedings that were pending on or commenced after its effective date October 31, 2007, whether the offense was committed prior to, on, or after that date. However, the Act did not entitle a defendant who was previously sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment to resentencing pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Act, unless the defendant was otherwise legally entitled to be resentenced. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 7, House Standing Committee Report No. 1.\n\nAct 40, Session Laws 2018, amended §706-662 to authorize an extended term of imprisonment for an offender who is convicted of negligent homicide in the first degree and did not remain at the scene of the crime and render reasonable assistance to an injured person. The legislature found that Hawaii is above the national average for persons who report driving after drinking too much, as well as the rate of deaths for all ages due to crashes involving a drunk driver. The legislature also noted a recent increase in fatal automotive crashes in which the offending driver failed to render aid after the crash.

      "text": "§706-663 Sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor and petty misdemeanor.After consideration of the factors set forth in sections 706-606 and 706-621, the court may sentence a person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor to imprisonment for a definite term to be fixed by the court and not to exceed one year in the case of a misdemeanor or thirty days in the case of a petty misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §41; am L 2016, c 217, § §2, 8]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-663\n\nThis section of the Code continues the previous policy of the law of providing definite sentences (not to exceed one year) in the case of misdemeanors,1 and adds a new category of minor criminal offenses, designated as petty misdemeanors, for which imprisonment not exceeding 30 days is authorized. The court is free within the statutory maximum to choose a shorter definite period of confinement.\n\nIndeterminate terms of imprisonment are not provided for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors because the gravity of the offenses and the character of most such offenders would not warrant the authorization of a longer prison term. The flexibility sought to be achieved by indeterminate sentences decreases as the maximum authorized term of imprisonment decreases. In view of this fact and in view of the fact that resources devoted to the determination of minimum terms of imprisonment have decreasing marginal utility as maximum authorized terms decrease, the Code provides for definite terms in cases of misdemeanors and petty misdemeanors.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-663\n\nAct 217, Session Laws 2016, amended this section by making a conforming amendment. Act 217 authorized the director of public safety to release detainees or inmates charged on or after July 1, 2016, with petty misdemeanor or misdemeanor offenses; provided that the detainee or inmate is not disqualified based on present charges or past arrest or conviction of certain serious or violent offenses. The legislature found that correctional facilities in Hawaii suffer from persistent overcrowding and that this condition adversely affects the ability of the State to adequately provide for the safe, secure, and humane incarceration of inmates in its care and custody. Act 217 provided a reasonable alternative to incarceration that would relieve overcrowded jail conditions in Hawaii. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3563, Conference Committee Report No. 70-16.\n\nWhere trial court's rationale for imposing jail time reflected the factors listed in §706-606, and the jail time imposed did not exceed the maximum jail term authorized by this section, trial court did not clearly exceed the bounds of reason nor disregard rules or principles of law or practice to defendant's substantial detriment in imposing a jail term; thus, trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to one hundred twenty days' imprisonment. 116 H. 403 (App.), 173 P.3d 550 (2007).\n\nBecause there was no provision in §706-605 for the imposition of anger management or other treatment programs, but §706-624(2)(j) authorized the imposition of, inter alia, mental health treatment as a discretionary term of probation, district court erred by sentencing defendant to both the thirty-day term of imprisonment (the maximum term of imprisonment for a petty misdemeanor) and anger management classes for defendant's harassment conviction (a petty misdemeanor). Defendant could have been sentenced to a thirty-day term of incarceration or a six-month term of probation, but not both, and thus defendant's sentence was illegal. 130 H. 332 (App.), 310 P.3d 1033 (2013).\n\nCited: 146 F.3d 661 (1998).\n\n§706-663 Commentary:\n\n1.

The court shall not impose an extended term unless the ground therefor has been established at a hearing after the conviction of the defendant and written notice of the ground proposed was given to the defendant pursuant to subsection (2). Subject to the provisions of section 706-604, the defendant shall have the right to hear and controvert the evidence against the defendant and to offer evidence upon the issue before a jury; provided that the defendant may waive the right to a jury determination under this subsection, in which case the determination shall be made by the court.\n\n(2) Notice of intention to seek an extended term of imprisonment under section 706-662 shall be given to the defendant within thirty days of the defendant's arraignment.

Fairness to the defendant demands that the defendant receive notice of the ground upon which an extended term is proposed and that the hearing focus on this issue. In other respects the hearing will be the same as that provided for in cases involving the possibility of imprisonment within the ordinary limits.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-664\n\nAct 1, Second Special Session Laws 2007, amended this section and other extended sentencing statutes ( § §706-661 and 706-662) to ensure that the procedures used to impose extended terms of imprisonment comply with the requirements of the United States Supreme Court and the Hawaii supreme court. Act 1 required that a jury determine the facts necessary to impose an extended term of imprisonment, unless the defendant waives the right to a jury determination, and that facts necessary to impose an extended term of imprisonment are proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The legislature found that Hawaii's current extended sentencing procedure had been deemed unconstitutional because a judge, rather than a jury, was required to find facts, other than those of prior or concurrent convictions, necessary to enhance a defendant's sentence beyond the ordinary or standard term authorized by the jury's verdict. Act 1's amendments conformed the State's enhanced sentencing law to the requirements of the United States Supreme Court and the Hawaii supreme court. Act 1 applied retroactively to sentencing or resentencing proceedings that were pending on or commenced after its effective date [October 31, 2007], whether the offense was committed prior to, on, or after that date. However, the Act did not entitle a defendant who was previously sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment to resentencing pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Act, unless the defendant was otherwise legally entitled to be resentenced.

Such conviction shall be deemed to have been of a felony if sentence of death or of imprisonment in excess of one year was authorized under the law of such other jurisdiction. Such a conviction shall be graded, for purposes of section 706-620 by comparing the maximum imprisonment authorized under the law of such other jurisdiction with the maximum imprisonment authorized for the relevant grade of felony. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1986, c 314, §43]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-665\n\nSince the minimal requirements for an extended term of imprisonment for a persistent offender deal in part with former convictions, it becomes necessary to treat the problem raised by former convictions in another jurisdiction. The Code recognizes such convictions for purposes of §706-662. In order to achieve a uniform standard for grading foreign convictions, the Code measures the authorized sentence in the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred according to the grading system of this Code.\n\nA problem is presented by the fact that some states authorize imprisonment for terms of more than one year for crimes denominated as misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors by the Code. There is no easy answer to this dilemma. For the purposes of determining the persistency of an offender, the power and integrity of the penal codes of other states must be recognized. The court, however, is not compelled to order an extended term of imprisonment even if the minimal conditions are established. Where a defendant's status as a persistent offender is based on foreign convictions which are greater than those authorized by the Code, the court is free not to make such a finding if, in the opinion of the court, it would result in undue hardship.\n\nPrior convictions in which defendant was denied counsel should not be used against the defendant. 56 H. 628, 548 P.2d 632 (1976).",

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1982, c 246, §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-666\n\nSection 706-666 is addressed to the problems of the definition and proof of former convictions. The Code takes the position that, in determining whether the defendant is a persistent offender, conviction per se is sufficient provided the time for appeal has expired and the defendant has not been pardoned on the ground of innocence. The fact that the disposition of the defendant resulted in a suspended sentence or a suspended execution of a sentence should not be held material for purposes of extended terms.\n\nSubsection (2) provides for a non-restrictive approach to admitting evidence on prior convictions. Since (1) the evidence relied upon is largely official records, (2) the issue is tried to the court, and (3) the court is not compelled to find the defendant a persistent offender, or to impose an extended term even if the minimal requirements are established, no sound purpose would be served by adopting a restrictive evidentiary approach.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-666\n\nAct 246, Session Laws 1982, clarified the definition of a conviction by providing that an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction that the defendant committed a crime constitutes a conviction.\n\nIn State v. Kamae, 56 H. 32, 526 P.2d 1200 (1974), the court held that an appeal in forma pauperis was not frivolous when it sought to raise the question of whether the trial court's reliance on a pre-sentence diagnosis and report was sufficient under §706-666(2) to establish that the defendant was a multiple offender warranting an extended term under §706-662(4). The court did not reach the ultimate question.\n\nPre-sentence report held insufficient evidence of prior conviction. 56 H. 628, 548 P.2d 632 (1976).\n\nWith regard to mandatory minimum sentencing as a repeat offender under §706 €“606.5, proof of defendant's prior conviction must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, not by the court under a \"reasonabl[e] satisf[action]\" standard. 136 H. 244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015).\n\nEvidence of defendant's prior conviction reasonably satisfied the court. 9 H. App. 583, 854 P.2d 238 (1993).\n\nState presented sufficient evidence to show that defendant was a repeat offender under §291E-61, where the State introduced: (1) a case detail report, certified by a district court clerk, that showed that the district court accepted the no contest plea of defendant to a previous charge under §291E-61, that defendant was sentenced, and that a \"judgment and notice\" was filed; and (2) a traffic abstract for defendant, certified by a district court clerk, that also showed the same information reflected in the case detail report. 134 H. 280 (App.), 339 P.3d 1081 (2014).\n\nWhere State's evidence showed that a person with the same name, residence address, date of birth, and last four digits of the social security number as defendant, with a similar appearing signature as defendant, and whose prior traffic convictions were included in defendant's abstract, was previously convicted under §291E-61, there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant was the person previously convicted. 134 H. 280 (App.), 339 P.3d 1081 (2014).\n\nCited: 133 H. 102, 324 P.3d 912 (2014).",

      "text": "§706-667 Young adult defendants.(1) Defined. A young adult defendant is a person convicted of a crime who, at the time of the offense, is less than twenty-two years of age and who has not been previously convicted of a felony as an adult or adjudicated as a juvenile for an offense that would have constituted a felony had the young adult defendant been an adult.\n\n(2) Specialized correctional treatment. A young adult defendant who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding thirty days may be committed by the court to the custody of the department of corrections and rehabilitation and shall receive, as far as practicable, such special and individualized correctional and rehabilitative treatment as may be appropriate to the young adult defendant's needs.\n\n(3) Special term. A young adult defendant convicted of a felony, in lieu of any other sentence of imprisonment authorized by this chapter, may be sentenced to a special indeterminate term of imprisonment if the court is of the opinion that such special term is adequate for the young adult defendant's correction and rehabilitation and will not jeopardize the protection of the public. When ordering a special indeterminate term of imprisonment, the court shall impose the maximum length of imprisonment, which shall be eight years for a class A felony, five years for a class B felony, and four years for a class C felony. The minimum length of imprisonment shall be set by the Hawaii paroling authority in accordance with section 706-669. During this special indeterminate term, the young adult shall be incarcerated separately from career criminals, when practicable.\n\n[(4)] This section shall not apply to the offenses of murder or attempted murder. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1976, c 92, §8; am L 1980, c 295, § §2, 3; am L 1986, c 314, §44; am L 1987, c 338, §10; am L 1989, c 211, §8; gen ch 1993; am L 1997, c 318, §4; am L 2006, c 230, §25; am L 2022, c 278, §29]\n\nCross References\n\nImmaturity excluding penal conviction; transfer of proceedings to family court, see §704-418.\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-667\n\nThis section provides for specialized treatment for young persons over whom family court jurisdiction has been waived and for those persons under the age of 22 years who are not subject to the jurisdiction of that court.\n\nIt is clear that the age span encompassed in this section is a period of formative years and, notwithstanding the fact that the defendants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the family court, \"[p]rudence and humanity... argue for a specialized and concentrated effort in this area.\"[1]\n\nSubsection (2) recognizes that specialized and concentrated effort includes penal institutions designed to meet the needs of young adult defendants. The department of social services and housing should have among its various divisions, an agency which can provide the young adult defendant with such \"special and individualized correctional and rehabilitative treatment as may be appropriate to his needs.\" Subsection (2) provides that, regardless of whether a special term is imposed pursuant to subsection (3), when a young adult defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for more than 30 days (i.e., for a misdemeanor or felony) the young adult defendant may be committed to the department of social services and housing for special correctional and rehabilitative treatment.\n\nSubsection (3) provides for a special term of imprisonment for young adult defendants convicted of a felony. Once again, the Code adopts a flexible approach in sentencing. The court is not compelled to impose a special term in the case of a convicted young adult. It may, according to the provisions of part II of this chapter, suspend the imposition of sentence or sentence the defendant to probation. If the court determines that imprisonment is necessary, the court is free, within the limitations heretofore set forth, to choose between the special term authorized by this section and the ordinary and extended terms authorized by prior sections in this part. Subsection (3) merely authorizes the employment of a special, more limited term of imprisonment \"if the court is of the opinion that such special term is adequate for... [the defendant's] correction and rehabilitation and will not jeopardize the protection of the public.\" Assuming the court is satisfied that this condition can be met, there seems no reason for not allowing the court, if it chooses, to protect the young offender from the longer maxima provided for felonies.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-667\n\nThe legislature in enacting the Code in 1972 changed subsection (2) by making it discretionary with the court, rather than mandatory, to commit the young adult defendant to the custody of the department of social services and housing for specialized treatment.\n\nAct 295, Session Laws 1980, amended this section to establish a more equitable and just system of sentencing young adults. Conference Committee Report No. 34-80 (42-80). Subsection (1) was amended by changing the definition of a young adult defendant so as to exclude repeat felony offenders from the class of young persons entitled to specialized treatment. Subsection (3) was amended to provide for different terms of imprisonment depending upon whether the offense involved is a class A, B, or C felony. Subsection (3) was also amended by the addition of an express provision that young adults be incarcerated separately from career criminals when practicable. Lastly, the section was amended to provide that it does not apply to the offense of murder.\n\nAct 318, Session Laws 1997, amended this section by defining a young adult defendant as a person convicted of a crime who, at the time of sentencing, is less than twenty-two years of age. The legislature found that immediate action was necessary for the protection and safety of the community from the growing number of minors who commit violent, serious, or multiple felonies. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1561.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among other things, require that the young adult defendant be less than twenty-two years at the time of the offense, rather than at the time of sentencing.\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to replace references to \"department of public safety\" with \"department of corrections and rehabilitation\" to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation. The legislature further found that reorganizing certain state law enforcement functions into a single entity with consistent training opportunities would allow for the efficient use of resources in administering correctional programs and improve decision making, promote accountability, streamline communication, decrease costs, reduce duplication of efforts, provide uniform training and standards, and promote uniform standards of law enforcement services.

In addition, the prisoner shall:\n\n(a) Be permitted to consult with any persons the prisoner reasonably desires, including the prisoner's own legal counsel, in preparing for the hearing;\n\n(b) Be permitted to be represented and assisted by counsel at the hearing;\n\n(c) Have counsel appointed to represent and assist the prisoner if the prisoner so requests and cannot afford to retain counsel; and\n\n(d) Be informed of the prisoner's rights under [paragraphs] (a), (b), and (c).\n\n(4) The authority in its discretion may, in any particular case and at any time, impose a special condition that the prisoner will not be considered for parole unless and until the prisoner has a record of continuous exemplary behavior.\n\n(5) After sixty days notice to the prosecuting attorney, the authority in its discretion may reduce the minimum term fixed by its order pursuant to subsection (1).\n\n(6) A verbatim stenographic or mechanical record of the hearing shall be made and preserved in transcribed or untranscribed form.\n\n(7) The State shall have the right to be represented at the hearing by the prosecuting attorney who may present written testimony and make oral comments and the authority shall consider such testimony and comments in reaching its decision. The authority shall notify the prosecuting attorney of the hearing at the time the prisoner is given notice of the hearing. The hearing shall be opened to victims or their designees or surviving immediate family members who may present a written statement or make oral comments.\n\n(8) The authority shall establish guidelines for the uniform determination of minimum sentences which shall take into account both the nature and degree of the offense of the prisoner and the prisoner's criminal history and character. The guidelines shall be public records and shall be made available to the prisoner and to the prosecuting attorney and other interested government agencies.

However, the Code differs from present law in two respects: (a) it does not recognize a sentence of imprisonment not subject to the possibility of parole except the instances enumerated in §706-606(a), and (b) it provides that the order of the Board shall be made upon the basis of a prior hearing which, under subsection (3), affords the prisoner an opportunity to be heard and a mode for participation. Both concepts are suggested by the Model Penal Code.1 In addition, subsection (3) specifically provides that the prisoner will be afforded assistance and representation by counsel, if the prisoner wishes.\n\nSubsection (2) continues the previous requirement that the Board of Paroles arm itself with sufficient information concerning the prisoner before it makes a determination as to parole eligibility. Subsection (4) is a continuation of the previous policy of granting to the Board the authority to impose a special condition relating to the prisoner's behavior before the prisoner will be eligible for parole. Subsection (5) gives the Board the discretionary power to reduce the minimum term previously fixed by its order. Subsection (6) insures that a record of the hearing will be made and preserved.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-669\n\nWhen the legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it provided for life imprisonment without possibility of parole in the four instances enumerated in §706-606(a) (1972).\n\nAct 92, Session Laws 1976, substituted the terms \"Hawaii paroling authority\" and \"authority\" for the term \"board of paroles and pardons\" and \"board.\"\n\nAct 282, Session Laws 1988, amended this section to allow the prosecuting attorney to appear and present oral comment and written testimony at minimum term hearings before the Hawaii paroling authority, disallowing oral testimony by witnesses. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 270, House Conference Committee Report No. 96-88.\n\nAct 4, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by clarifying that victims may present written statements or oral comments at minimum prison term hearings before the parole board. The legislature found that the practice of the parole board was to permit victims or their representatives the opportunity to comment at minimum term hearings, although current law did not expressly provide for that opportunity. The legislature agreed that victims should be allowed to be heard and to be present at the hearings, and that victims were entitled to be heard when the crimes involved property, as well as when the crimes were against persons. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1972, House Standing Committee Report No. 1025-96.\n\nAct 193, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by providing that the prosecuting attorney shall receive sixty days notice prior to the reduction of minimum terms of imprisonment by the Hawaii paroling authority. Current law was unclear regarding whether the prosecuting attorney was entitled to notice prior to the reduction of minimum terms of imprisonment by the paroling authority. The Act clarified that the prosecuting attorney is entitled to notice. Conference Committee Report No. 60.\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to replace references to \"department of public safety\" with \"department of corrections and rehabilitation\" to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation. The legislature further found that reorganizing certain state law enforcement functions into a single entity with consistent training opportunities would allow for the efficient use of resources in administering correctional programs and improve decision making, promote accountability, streamline communication, decrease costs, reduce duplication of efforts, provide uniform training and standards, and promote uniform standards of law enforcement services.

A person sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment shall receive an initial parole hearing at least one month before the expiration of the minimum term of imprisonment determined by the Hawaii paroling authority pursuant to section 706-669. If the person has been sentenced to multiple terms of imprisonment, the parole hearing shall not be required until at least one month before the expiration of the minimum term that expires last in time. A validated risk assessment shall be used to determine the person's risk of re-offense and suitability for community supervision. For purposes of this subsection, \"validated risk assessment\" means an actuarial tool to determine a person's likelihood of engaging in future criminal behavior. The department of corrections and rehabilitation shall select a research-based risk assessment tool and shall validate the accuracy of the risk assessment tool at least every five years in consultation with the paroling authority. Assessments shall be performed by department of corrections and rehabilitation staff who are trained in the use of the risk assessment tool. Except for good cause shown to the paroling authority, a person who is assessed as low risk for re-offending shall be granted parole upon completing the minimum sentence, unless the person:\n\n(a) Is found to have an extensive criminal history record that is indicative of a likelihood of future criminal behavior in spite of the finding by the risk assessment by the paroling authority;\n\n(b) Is found to have committed misconduct while in prison that is equivalent to a misdemeanor or felony crime within thirty-six months of the expiration of the minimum term of imprisonment;\n\n(c) Has any pending felony charges in the State;\n\n(d) Is incarcerated for a sexual offense under part V of chapter 707 or child abuse under part VI of chapter 707; or\n\n(e) Does not have a parole plan as set forth under section 706-670(3) and (4), as approved by, and at the discretion of, the paroling authority.\n\nIf parole is not granted at the initial parole hearing, additional hearings shall be held at twelve-month intervals or less until parole is granted or the maximum period of imprisonment expires. The State shall have the right to be represented at the initial parole hearing and all subsequent parole hearings by the prosecuting attorney, who may present written testimony and make oral comments. The authority shall consider the testimony and comments in reaching its decision. The authority shall notify the appropriate prosecuting attorney of the hearing at the time the prisoner is given notice of the hearing.\n\n(2) Parole conditions. The authority, as a condition of parole, may impose reasonable conditions on the prisoner as provided under section 706-624.\n\n(3) Prisoner's plan and participation. Each prisoner shall be given reasonable notice of the prisoner's parole hearing and shall prepare a parole plan, setting forth the manner of life the prisoner intends to lead if released on parole, including specific information as to where and with whom the prisoner will reside, a phone contact where the prisoner can be reached, and what occupation or employment the prisoner will follow, if any. The prisoner shall be paroled in the county where the prisoner had a permanent residence or occupation or employment prior to the prisoner's incarceration, unless the prisoner will: reside in a county in which the population exceeds eight-hundred thousand persons; reside in a county in the State in which the committed person has the greatest family or community support, opportunities for employment, job training, education, treatment, and other social services, as determined by the Hawaii paroling authority; or be released for immediate departure from the State. The institutional parole staff shall render reasonable aid to the prisoner in the preparation of the prisoner's plan and in securing information for submission to the authority. In addition, the prisoner shall:\n\n(a) Be permitted to consult with any persons whose assistance the prisoner reasonably desires, including the prisoner's own legal counsel, in preparing for a hearing before the authority;\n\n(b) Be permitted to be represented and assisted by counsel at the hearing;\n\n(c) Have counsel appointed to represent and assist the prisoner if the prisoner so requests and cannot afford to retain counsel; and\n\n(d) Be informed of the prisoner's rights as set forth in this subsection.\n\n(4) Authority's decision; initial minimum term of parole. The authority shall render its decision regarding a prisoner's release on parole within a reasonable time after the parole hearing. A grant of parole shall not be subject to acceptance by the prisoner. If the authority denies parole after the hearing, it shall state its reasons in writing. A verbatim stenographic or mechanical record of the parole hearing shall be made and preserved in transcribed or untranscribed form. The authority, in its discretion, may order a reconsideration or rehearing of the case at any time and shall provide reasonable notice of the reconsideration or rehearing to the prosecuting attorney. If parole is granted by the authority, the authority shall set the initial minimum length of the parole term.\n\n(5) Release upon expiration of maximum term. If the authority fixes no earlier release date, a prisoner's release shall become mandatory at the expiration of the prisoner's maximum term of imprisonment.\n\n(6) Sentence of imprisonment includes separate parole term. A sentence to an indeterminate term of imprisonment under this chapter includes as a separate portion of the sentence a term of parole or of recommitment for violation of the conditions of parole.\n\n(7) Revocation hearing. When a parolee has been recommitted, the authority shall hold a hearing within sixty days after the parolee's return to determine whether parole should be revoked. The parolee shall have reasonable notice of the grounds alleged for revocation of the parolee's parole. The institutional parole staff shall render reasonable aid to the parolee in preparation for the hearing. In addition, the parolee shall have, with respect to the revocation hearing, those rights set forth in subsection (3)(a), (3)(b), (3)(c), and (3)(d). A record of the hearing shall be made and preserved as provided in subsection (4).\n\n(8) Length of recommitment and reparole after revocation of parole. If a parolee's parole is revoked, the term of further imprisonment upon such recommitment and of any subsequent reparole or recommitment under the same sentence shall be fixed by the authority but shall not exceed in aggregate length the unserved balance of the maximum term of imprisonment.\n\n(9) Final unconditional release. When the prisoner's maximum parole term has expired or the prisoner has been sooner discharged from parole, a prisoner shall be deemed to have served the prisoner's sentence and shall be released unconditionally.

L 2012, c 139, §14(3).\n\nCross References\n\nComprehensive offender reentry system, see chapter 353H.\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-670\n\nSubsections (1) through (3) are largely self-explanatory and adopt a procedure for parole determination which affords the prisoner an opportunity to participate and be heard. The procedure also provides for periodic review of the prisoner's case.\n\nIn the Proposed Draft, §670 provided for an automatic period of parole, the length of which would vary with the prisoner's initial period of incarceration, but which would not be greater than ten years, and which would be required in every case following an indeterminate term of imprisonment. The legislature did not accept this proposal in its entirety. Thus, subsection (4) now requires a prisoner's unconditional release at the expiration of the prisoner's maximum term of imprisonment. The legislature felt that to impose \"an additional term of parole would be an unfair burden to a person who has paid his debt to society.\" Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\nSubsection (5) provides that the maximum term of parole shall be ten years. In this area, as in terms of imprisonment, the Code leaves with the Board of Paroles and Pardons the task of determining the minimum term of parole.\n\nSubsection (6) provides for a hearing on revocation of parole which affords the parolee fair notice, representation, and assistance, much in the same manner as that provided in the case of hearings on the minimum term and initial parole.\n\nSubsection (8) provides for unconditional discharge of the defendant when the maximum term of parole has expired or upon sooner release by the Board.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-670\n\nAct 30, Session Laws 1983, amended subsection (1) to change the maximum term of recommittal for a parole violator from ten years to the remainder of the parolee's original, maximum sentence. It was felt that a parole violator should not be relieved of any part of the court-imposed maximum sentence. However, the legislature intended that the paroling authority periodically reconsider the parole of any recommitted parolee. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 357 (1983), House Standing Committee Report No. 811.\n\nAct 257, Session Laws 1984, added a new subsection (2) to allow the paroling authority, as a condition of parole, to prohibit a parolee from entering certain geographical areas without the paroling authority's permission.\n\nAct 282, Session Laws 1988, amended this section to allow the prosecuting attorney to appear and present oral comment and written testimony at parole hearings before the Hawaii paroling authority, disallowing oral testimony by witnesses. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 270, House Conference Committee Report No. 96-88.\n\nAct 101, Session Laws 1993, amended subsection (4) to clarify that a grant of parole is not subject to the acceptance of the person being paroled. Inmates who refuse parole and choose to remain in prison take up valuable bedspace in already crowded correctional facilities, and the State loses the opportunity to assist in reintegrating them back into the community. House Standing Committee Report No. 1123, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 839.\n\nAct 201, Session Laws 1993, amended subsection (3) to provide that prisoners who have been granted parole are to be paroled in the county where the prisoner had a permanent residence or occupation or employment prior to incarceration, unless the prisoner will reside in a county having a population exceeding 800,000 persons, or will be released for immediate departure from the State. The legislature found that this would prevent an influx of parolees whose roots are on Oahu from settling on the neighbor islands, which could strain a county's social service infrastructure. Conference Committee Report No. 104.\n\nAct 193, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by providing that the prosecuting attorney shall have the right to be represented at the initial parole hearing and all subsequent parole hearings, and that the prosecuting attorney shall have reasonable notice of the reconsideration or rehearing of parole cases by the Hawaii paroling authority. The Act made clear the prosecuting attorney's right to be represented and to receive notice, since the current law was unclear regarding the prosecuting attorney's rights on these matters. Conference Committee Report No. 60.\n\nAct 8, Special Session Laws 2007, amended subsection (3) to permit the Hawaii paroling authority to parole committed persons to the county in the State where the committed person has the greatest family or community support, opportunities for employment, job training, education, treatment, and other social services. This will allow the Hawaii paroling authority to provide meaningful opportunities for offenders to reintegrate into society and demonstrate that they have the potential to function as law-abiding citizens. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 993.\n\nAct 139, Session Laws 2012, amended this section, among other things, by: (1) requiring the department of corrections and rehabilitation to select a research-based risk assessment tool and validate the accuracy of the risk assessment tool at least every five years in consultation with the Hawaii paroling authority; (2) specifying that parole shall be granted upon completion of the minimum term to a person who is assessed as low risk for reoffending unless the person, among other things, is found to have: (A) committed misconduct while in prison that is equivalent to a misdemeanor or felony crime within thirty-six months of the expiration of the minimum term of imprisonment; or (B) an extensive criminal history record that is indicative of a likelihood of future criminal behavior in spite of the finding by the risk assessment; and (3) requiring prisoners, in preparing their parole plan, to include, among other things, a phone contact, if any, where they can be reached. The purpose of Act 139 was to implement the recommendations of the justice reinvestment working group. Act 139 was a recommendation of the Council of State Governments Justice Center, which provided intensive technical assistance to Hawaii to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the State's criminal justice system and to help state leaders develop policy options that could increase public safety while saving taxpayer dollars. The Justice Center utilized a data-driven approach to identify inefficiencies, develop cost-effective policy options, and develop a plan for a reinvestment of savings that reduces recidivism and increases public safety. It was the legislature's intent to realize cost savings and reinvest those savings back into the corrections system to reduce recidivism, decrease the prison population, and strengthen public safety. Conference Committee Report No. 165-12.\n\nAct 139, Session Laws 2012, also provided for the reenactment of subsection (1) upon the repeal of the amendments made by the Act on July 1, 2018.\n\nAct 67, Session Laws 2013, made a technical amendment to the repeal and reenactment provision of Act 139, Session Laws 2012, which affected this section.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended the repeal and reenactment provision of Act 139, Session Laws 2012.\n\nAct 77, Session Laws 2017, made permanent certain provisions of Act 139, Session Laws 2012 [which amended this section], the justice reinvestment initiative, relating to pretrial risk assessments, parole, and parole hearings. The legislature found that overcrowding in prisons poses a significant threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The legislature further found that after only the first year of implementation, justice reinvestment led to a four per cent decrease in the State's incarcerated population and saved the State $2,500,000 in fiscal year 2013. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1523, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 956.\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to replace references to \"department of public safety\" with \"department of corrections and rehabilitation\" to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation. The legislature further found that reorganizing certain state law enforcement functions into a single entity with consistent training opportunities would allow for the efficient use of resources in administering correctional programs and improve decision making, promote accountability, streamline communication, decrease costs, reduce duplication of efforts, provide uniform training and standards, and promote uniform standards of law enforcement services. House Standing Committee Report No. 200-22, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3292.\n\nNeither this chapter nor chapter 353 prohibits the Hawaii paroling authority from setting a prisoner's minimum term at a period equal to his or her maximum sentence. 97 H. 183, 35 P.3d 210 (2001).\n\nAs §353-66 and this section can be given effect without conflict, subsection (7) is not the \"exclusive\" law governing parole revocations, does not embrace the entire law on the subject, and does not repeal §353-66 by implication. 88 H. 229 (App.), 965 P.2d 162 (1998).\n\nA petitioner is not entitled to relief for Hawaii paroling authority's failure to comply with time limit specified in subsection (7) for parole revocation hearing unless record shows that failure to comply (1) was unreasonable and (2) caused petitioner actual prejudice. State's failure to comply with specified time limit is presumptively unreasonable and it is Hawaii paroling authority's burden to rebut this presumption; it is petitioner's burden to prove that State's unreasonable failure to comply caused actual prejudice to petitioner. 89 H. 474 (App.), 974 P.2d 1064 (1998).",

This addition was intended to insure that crime victims \"are treated with fairness and respect\" and that agencies in the criminal justice system cooperate with each other to provide information and other help to crime victims. House Conference Committee Report No. 46.\n\nAct 227, Session Laws 1985, amended this section so that: (1) victims or surviving immediate family members of a deceased victim are notified whenever the offender is paroled or unconditionally released; and (2) in lieu of notifying a victim or surviving family member, the appropriate authorities may notify the witness or victim counselor programs in the county where the victim or a family member resides. Under prior law, only the victim was notified of the parole or unconditional release. House Conference Committee Report No. 5, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 4.\n\nAct 383, Session Laws 1997, amended this section by amending the definition of \"surviving immediate family member\" to include a reciprocal beneficiary. The amendment establishes the status of reciprocal beneficiaries and provides certain state governmental benefits to those with that status. Among the benefits extended to reciprocal beneficiaries which are substantially equivalent to those extended to spouses is legal standing relating to victims rights. Conference Committee Report No. 2.\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to replace references to \"department of public safety\" with \"department of corrections and rehabilitation\" to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation. The legislature further found that reorganizing certain state law enforcement functions into a single entity with consistent training opportunities would allow for the efficient use of resources in administering correctional programs and improve decision making, promote accountability, streamline communication, decrease costs, reduce duplication of efforts, provide uniform training and standards, and promote uniform standards of law enforcement services.

The officer having custody of the defendant shall furnish a certificate to the court at the time of sentence, showing the length of such detention of the defendant prior to sentence in any State or local correctional or other institution, and the certificate shall be annexed to the official records of the defendant's commitment.\n\n(2) When a judgment of conviction or a sentence is vacated and a new sentence is thereafter imposed upon the defendant for the same crime, the period of detention and imprisonment theretofore served shall be deducted from the minimum and maximum terms of the new sentence. The officer having custody of the defendant shall furnish a certificate to the court at the time of sentence, showing the period of imprisonment served under the original sentence, and the certificate shall be annexed to the official records of the defendant's new commitment.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) and any other law to the contrary, when a defendant is sentenced for a crime committed while serving a sentence of imprisonment on a separate unrelated felony conviction, and the defendant was detained in any state or local correctional or other institution following the defendant's arrest for the crime for which a sentence is imposed, any periods of detention following the defendant's arrest that took place while the defendant was also serving a sentence of imprisonment for the separate unrelated felony conviction shall not be deducted from the minimum and maximum terms of the sentence imposed on the later crime.

The prohibition in this Act [amending section 706-671] against deducting the time served on a separate unrelated felony from the sentence imposed for a crime committed while in prison for the separate unrelated felony shall not apply when the crime committed while in prison for the separate unrelated felony, was committed prior to the effective date of this Act July 1, 2012.\"\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §706-671\n\nThis section provides for a result which the Code deems fair. It provides that time spent in incarceration before sentence or, where a prior conviction or sentence has been vacated, before resentence be credited against the minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment. While it is true that most felons will be paroled prior to the expiration of the maximum term authorized by statute, nevertheless this section provides for some equalization, in the remaining felony cases and in misdemeanor cases, between those defendants who obtain pre-sentence release and those who do not.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-671\n\nThe legislature in enacting the Code changed 671, as set forth in the Proposed Draft, to provide that a convicted person shall receive credit for any time served in any state or local correctional facility against both the minimum and maximum term of imprisonment. This provides for those few instances where the Code or other statutes provide for minimum terms of imprisonment. Cf. §706-606, as enacted.\n\nAct 50, Session Laws 2012, amended this section by clarifying that a defendant would not earn credit for time served for a subsequent crime while the defendant is serving an imprisonment sentence for a separate, unrelated offense. The legislature found that the existing language of and case law related to this section has led to ambiguities and inconsistencies by the parties involved in a criminal case. Act 50 created uniform application and deterred imprisoned offenders from incurring new offenses. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3188.\n\nAct 110, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to clarify that a defendant being sentenced for an offense that was committed while serving a sentence of imprisonment on a separate unrelated felony conviction cannot be given credit for a period of pre-sentence detention that took place while the defendant was also serving the sentence of imprisonment for the separate unrelated felony conviction. The legislature found that inState v. Abihai, 146 Hawaii 398, 463 P.3d 1055 (2020), the Hawaii Supreme Court held that the plain language in subsection (3) did not eliminate the defendant's entitlement to pre-sentence detention credit pursuant to the language outlined in subsection (1). More specifically, the Court held that a defendant was still entitled to pre-sentence detention credit for the period of time the defendant was simultaneously being detained for a separate unrelated felony conviction and a subsequent offense. However, when Act 50, Session Laws 2012, codified subsection (3), the legislature indicated that the purpose and intent of Act 50 was to clarify that a defendant would not earn credit for time served for a subsequent offense while the defendant was serving a sentence of imprisonment for a separate unrelated offense. The legislature noted that Act 110 would clarify and solidify the legislative intent of subsection (3) and ensure that convicted offenders would not benefit from effectively shortened sentences if they commit new crimes while incarcerated.

The director of corrections and rehabilitation shall determine the proper program of redirection and any place of confinement of the committed person.

H.R.S. §711-83 (as codified prior to this Code) provided that felons be committed to the custody of the director of the department of social services and housing for placement within the correctional facilities of the department. Although there was no specific statutory direction that persons imprisoned for misdemeanors shall be incarcerated in county jails,1 this was the usual practice.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §706-672\n\nIn enacting the Code, the legislature added to §672(1) of the Proposed Draft the last sentence which allows the court to determine theinitialplace of confinement. The Conference Committee Report states that \"the Director of the Department of Social Services and Housing shall determine the proper program of redirection and anysubsequentplace of confinement best suited to meet the individual needs of the committed person.\" Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972) (emphasis added). The committee also put its gloss on the word \"institution,\" appearing in subsection (2), by stating its \"intent that 'institution' refers to any detention or correctional facility other than Oahu prison.\" Id.\n\nAct 182, Session Laws 1983, amended this section to authorize the director of social services to determine a convicted person's place of confinement. Under prior law, courts determined the initial place of confinement for convicted persons with indeterminate prison terms and also determined the permanent place of confinement for convicted persons with definite prison terms. Because of that law, convicted persons were sometimes inappropriately housed due to the court's commitment or the prisoner's subsequent behavior. By amending this section, the director is able to place convicted persons in the most appropriate program and is better able to use the department's resources to provide for the safety of other prisoners and the department's staff. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 722, House Standing Committee Report No. 419.\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended this section to replace references to \"department of public safety\" or \"director of public safety\" with \"department of corrections and rehabilitation\" or \"director of corrections and rehabilitation\", as applicable, to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation.
