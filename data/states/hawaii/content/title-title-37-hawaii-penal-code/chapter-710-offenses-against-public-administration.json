[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1989, c 261, §21]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1001\n\nThis section is derived from the previous law on the forfeiture of bribery money.[1] Since this chapter deals with additional kindred offenses, e.g., compounding, giving and receiving unlawful compensation, giving and receiving improper gifts, unlawful assistance of a private interest, and obtaining unlawful assistance of a public servant, the forfeiture is expressed in general terms to cover all sections in which property is offered, conferred, agreed to be conferred, or accepted as a benefit, pecuniary benefit, or compensation in the commission of an offense defined in this chapter. The mere solicitation or agreement to accept property would not, of course, work a forfeiture.\n\nThe forfeiture is specifically made subject to the requirements of §701-119 which embodies a single procedure for the establishment of all forfeitures declared by the Penal Code. The procedure provides, as did the previous law,2 for the protection of innocent owners of property which is involved in the commission of an offense.\n\n§710-1001 Commentary:\n\n1.

      "text": "§710-1010 Obstructing government operations.(1) A person commits the offense of obstructing government operations if, by using or threatening to use violence, force, or physical interference or obstacle, the person intentionally obstructs, impairs, or hinders:\n\n(a) The performance of a governmental function by a public servant acting under color of the public servant's official authority;\n\n(b) The enforcement of the penal law or the preservation of the peace by a law enforcement officer acting under color of the law enforcement officer's official authority; or\n\n(c) The operation of a radio, telephone, television, or other telecommunication system owned or operated by the State or one of its political subdivisions.\n\n(2) This section does not apply to:\n\n(a) The obstruction, impairment, or hindrance of the making of an arrest;\n\n(b) The obstruction, impairment, or hindrance of any governmental function, as provided by law, in connection with a labor dispute with the government; or\n\n(c) A person who is making a video or audio recording or taking a photograph of a law enforcement officer while the officer is in the performance of the officer's duties in a public place or under circumstances in which the officer has no reasonable expectation of privacy; provided that the officer may take reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public safety and order.\n\n(3) Obstruction of government operations is a misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1980, c 150, §1; am L 1991, c 223, §2; gen ch 1993; am L 2001, c 91, §3; am L 2016, c 164, §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1010\n\nThis section penalizes intentional interference with any level of government within the State. Subsection (1)(a) is addressed to governmental functions generally, subsection (1)(b) insures that peace officers acting under color of official authority are covered. Although subsection (1)(b) may not be needed, redundancy is to be preferred over ambiguity.\n\nTwo areas are specifically excepted from the operation of this section. The first excepted area, that of the making of an arrest, is covered under §710-1026 of this chapter. The second exception, that of labor disputes involving the government, is an area of conflicting policies.\n\nA labor dispute involving government employees ... presents special problems. Without the subsection [(2)(b)] exemption, activities which might constitute no more than tortious unfair labor practices in the context of normal industrial disputes would take on the added burden of criminal liability when the employer interfered with was the Government ... [W]hile such activity should not necessarily be protected, the appropriate sanctions should be determined by labor legislation, not the Criminal Code....[1]\n\nThis section requires that the obstruction be by means of violence, force, or physical interference. The Code takes the position that in many instances of nonfeasance by private individuals, e.g., by a failure to file a report required by law, the possibility of misdemeanor liability is too severe a sanction. In those cases where failure to do some act is attended by a substantial danger of disruption of governmental functions, special sections have been drafted to deal with the problems.[2]\n\nPrevious Hawaii law dealt with obstruction of governmental operations on an ad hoc basis; the previous coverage was somewhat spotty and the cases covered carried different penalties.[3] Under previous law, threats of violence against public officials were penalized as misdemeanors.[4] The Code seeks to extend the coverage of prior law to encompass protection of all governmental functions and to standardize the available penalties.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1010\n\nThe Code as adopted by the legislature in 1972 differs from the Proposed Draft in that in subsection (2)(b), the words \"as provided by law\" were inserted after the word \"function.\"\n\nAct 150, Session Laws 1980, reduced the offense from a misdemeanor to a petty misdemeanor. In view of the relatively light sentences being imposed by the courts, the classification for the offense was changed to a petty misdemeanor in order to keep the cases in the district court, thus reducing the congestion in the circuit court and expediting the disposition of these cases. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 693-80, House Standing Committee Report No. 874-80.\n\nAct 91, Session Laws 2001, clarified the offense of obstructing government operations by adding the operation of a radio, telephone, television, or other telecommunication system owned or operated by the State or a county. Electronic communications are utilized extensively by State and local governments, i.e., counties. Current law did not cover intentional obstruction, impairment, or hindering of radio, telephone, television, or other telecommunication systems owned or operated by the State or counties. Act 91 closed that gap.\n\nAlso, the term \"peace officer,\" as used in the Penal Code, caused the intermediate court of appeals to question whether the term meant \"law enforcement officer.\" Act 91 resolved the ambiguity by substituting that term for \"peace officer\" throughout the Penal Code. Conference Committee Report No. 23.\n\nAct 164, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to establish an exception to the offense of obstructing government operations for a person making a video or audio recording or photograph of a law enforcement officer while the officer is in the performance of duties in a public place or under circumstances in which the officer has no reasonable expectation of privacy; provided that the officer may take reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public safety and order. The legislature found that with the popularity and widespread use of smart phones with video or audio recording and photographing capabilities, recordings and photos of law enforcement officers who are exercising their duties have been used as evidence in police conduct matters or widely disseminated via social media. However, such recordings and photographs may be seen as obstructing government operations. Act 164 established an exception under certain circumstances to enable a person to record or photograph a law enforcement officer exercising the officer's duties without violating the law.

The legislature found that public corruption can take many forms beyond mere economic gain, including illegal lobbying, bribery, sexual favors, favorable school placements, and other actions that violate the public trust for personal gain. Accordingly, Act 130 provided a mechanism to increase the public's trust and confidence in the state and local government while providing law enforcement with a tool to adequately deter and commensurately punish public corruption.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 2001, c 91, §4]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1011\n\nThis section is not designed to allow peace officers to foist their routine or dangerous duties upon innocent citizens. The reasonable context in which this aid is required precludes requests for routine and unnecessary, as well as dangerous and unconscionable, aid. The type of situation which the Code envisions is the request to a citizen, by a peace officer, to summon aid or render immediately vital information, where there is no question of danger, incrimination, or substantial inconvenience to the person of whom the aid is asked. Various forms of this law may be found in the proposed revisions of other states.[1]\n\nPrevious Hawaii law provided for a $50 fine for refusal to aid a peace officer, under roughly the same circumstances as those provided in the Code.2 Instead, the Code imposes its lightest criminal penalty, petty misdemeanor, for this offense.\n\nThe waiver of civil liability in subsection (3) is both fair and necessary. The waiver is fair in that it is hardly equitable to order a person to perform a useful act, on one hand, then expose the person to the threat of civil liability, on the other. The waiver is necessary in that it would arguably be unreasonable to request such aid in many cases if all of the standards of civil liability were to apply. The person of whom aid is asked might, therefore, be able justifiably to refuse to give it.\n\nCited: 57 H. 390, 557 P.2d 1334 (1976).\n\n§710-1011 Commentary:\n\n1. See N.Y.R.P.L. §195.10; Prop.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1013\n\nThe harm in allowing the reporting or prosecution of any offense to be \"bought off\" need hardly be developed at length. The very functioning of any effective system for penalizing criminal behavior depends upon the unhampered reporting and prosecution of offenses. The traditional question is whether the offense of \"compounding\" shall apply to one who receives no pecuniary benefit, but nonetheless refrains from reporting an offense. When the offense was a felony, the common law recognized the crime of misprision of a felony, even if no pecuniary benefit was conferred. Most jurisdictions which have codified their penal law have rejected the crime of misprision,[1] as have most modern attempts at penal law revision.[2]\n\nSubsection (2) excludes cases where the consideration accepted is believed to be due as restitution or indemnification, and it does not require judicial approval. The commentary to the Model Penal Code, from which this section is derived, states the reason for the exception as follows:\n\nOur society does not, in general, impose penal sanctions to compel persons to inform authorities of crime. A person who refrains from reporting a crime of which he was the victim, because his loss has been made good, is no more derelict in his social duty than one who, out of indifference or friendship to the offender, fails to report a known offense. The threat of prosecution for compounding is, in any event, ineffective to promote reporting of offenses by victims who are willing to \"settle\" with the offender, since compounding laws can easily be evaded by accepting restitution or indemnification without explicit \"agreement\" to drop prosecution. Finally, compounding laws impugn the widespread practice of prosecutors, who are frequently content to drop prosecution when restitution has been made by the offender.[3]\n\nPrevious Hawaii law was in accord with the great majority of jurisdictions in rejecting the offense of misprision of a felony. The law penalized compounding of an offense carrying a life sentence with roughly the same dispositions as the Code makes available for any case of compounding.[4] When the compounding was of a lesser offense, the offense was a misdemeanor.5 The Code authorizes a uniform and, therefore, in some cases, more severe penalty than that authorized by present law.\n\n§710-1013 Commentary:\n\n1.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1014\n\nThe rendering of a false fire alarm is almost universally made criminal. The Code generalizes the principle to cover all emergency alarms and all governmental emergency organizations (the police would be included while responding to an alarm of this character), public utilities that deal with emergencies, and, in the case of fire departments, volunteer organizations. The justification for the provision is the prevention of the \"waste of government resources and the likelihood that the actor will cause personnel or equipment to be unavailable to deal with real emergencies.\"1\n\n§710-1014 Commentary:\n\n1.

This proscription would include cases where the crime or incident did not occur and where the report pretends to furnish information which the actor does not have.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law made false reporting to a police officer concerning a crime a misdemeanor. The Code, while retaining the same penalty, broadens and clarifies the definition of the offense.\n\n§710-1015 Commentary:\n\n1. M.P.C. §241.5; N.Y.R.P.L. §240.50; Prop. Del. Cr. Code §735; Prop.

Excluded from part II are offenses involving falsity which borders on perjury, e.g., false application or consent to marriage, false impersonation before a court.[2] These problems are dealt with directly in part VI of this chapter. Statutory protection for private fraternal organizations, by making unauthorized display of the badge or insignia of the organization a crime, is eliminated.[3] Also eliminated is the questionable distinction between the penalty which attaches to the unauthorized wearing of a police officer's uniform or badge and that which attaches to the unauthorized wearing of a uniform or badge which resembles a police officer's.4 Both situations are covered equally under this section provided other requirements are met.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1016\n\nAct 139, Session Laws 1984, amended this section to exclude the offense of impersonating a peace officer, which offense was made a class C felony.\n\nTrial court properly found defendant guilty of impersonating a public servant under this section where defendant wrote and signed a letter to defendant's attorney, in the name of defendant's supervisor, requesting the attorney to ask the presiding judge to drop contempt charges against defendant. 94 H. 440 (App.), 16 P.3d 845 (2000).\n\n§710-1016 Commentary:\n\n1.

The accuracy of public records is essential to efficient public administration and, beyond the immediate context of public administration, the government has an interest in protecting public confidence in its records.\n\nThis section does not require that the misuse of the public record be with intent to defraud another, i.e., to injure an interest which has value, as do the sections on forgery. Nor does this section require that the information made part of the public record, or offered for recordation, registration, or filing, be under oath or sworn to, as do the sections on perjury and related offenses. Those offenses, however, do complement the offense of tampering with public records, but they deal directly, and in a more precise context, with the aggravated circumstances presented.\n\nThis section is also addressed to the problem of access to public records. Obviously, acts of destruction and concealment impair the efficiency of public administration. Subsection (1)(d)(i) is intended primarily to cover acts of destruction, concealment, or impairment by individuals vis-a-vis the government, whereas subsection (1)(d)(ii) is intended primarily to cover the situation where a public servant refuses to surrender records to another public servant when the public servant has the duty to do so. Both clauses of this subsection are, however, worded broadly in order to cover acts of destruction, concealment, or retention outside their areas of immediate concern.\n\nSubsection (2) is intended to be inclusive and to cover not only records traditionally considered \"public\" but also information kept for the benefit of the government, such as medical prescription records.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law on tampering with public records is similar to the code,1 however the Code covers acts of tampering not covered under prior law, clarifies the acts that are covered, and dispenses with the former, archaic requirement of \"malice\" as it relates to this offense.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1017\n\nAct 33, Session Laws 2014, amended this section to apply to electronic statements, documents, or records.

When the aggravating circumstances of force or violence are present, the grade of the offense is increased to a class B felony.\n\nEscape is a fairly serious offense not only because of the potential danger to guards and bystanders incident to the nature of the activity but because it undermines the effectiveness of the system of criminal correction and punishment. From the administrative point of view, there are the disruptions of prison routine and the expense of recapture to consider as additional social evils. Moreover, when a question is raised concerning the legality of the detention, it is desirable to encourage reliance on legal processes, rather than self-help, to terminate any unjustified detention. In the absence of force or violence, the above social dangers and administrative inconvenience, alone, justify the class C felony sanction.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law graded escape on the basis of the crime for which the actor was originally in custody.1 There are two objections to this approach. First, where the actor has been lawfully imprisoned as a sanction for a crime which the actor has committed, the danger presented by the actor's escape is sui generis and has nothing to do with the offense for which the actor was committed. If a thief and a forger (or an accused thief and an accused forger) were to escape by identical methods, they should be penalized identically, according to the danger presented by their escapes alone. Hence, the Code has rejected this aspect of the former law and grades escapes according to the degree of individual and social danger presented by the actor's conduct.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §710-1020 AND 710-1021\n\nThe Code as adopted by the legislature in 1972 differs from the Proposed Draft in two areas. First, it includes escapes from \"correctional\" as well as \"detention\" facilities while the Proposed Draft did not. Correctional facilities were included in order to clarify that the offenses apply to existing diagnostic and rehabilitation programs as well as detention facilities. Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n\nSecond, the Code makes the penalty for escape more severe than the Proposed Draft. Under the Code, escape in the first degree is a class B felony, and escape in the second degree is a class C felony. The Proposed Draft had stated the penalties as class C and misdemeanor, respectively.\n\n§ §710-1020 And 710-1021 Commentary:\n\n1. H.R.S. § §740-1 through 740-3.",

Where the materials involved are intrinsically dangerous, to the actor or others, the offense is made a class B felony. Otherwise, it is a class C felony. It is clear that the peculiar population in correctional and detention facilities warrants the reinforcement of regulatory measures by criminal penalties.\n\nThe definition of \"unapproved dangerous instrument\" is intended to ensure that it is not criminal \"for a prisoner to have articles of potential danger when they are made available to him by prison authorities, e.g., in connection with tasks assigned to the prisoner.\"[1]\n\nThe definition of \"unapproved drug\" is intended to allow prison authorities to regulate the use of drugs by prisoners under their control. References to \"narcotic drugs\" or \"dangerous drugs\" would make the regulatory power of prison authorities depend on the statutory definition of those terms; a result which is undesirable. The power of prison authorities ought not to depend on the ability of the legislature to continually enact amendments which reflect the current drug market. Furthermore, definitions of those terms for purposes of drug abuse offenses would not necessarily serve the needs of prison population control.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law made it unlawful for one to bring into or to have possession of \"any alcohol, harmful drug, narcotic drug in any amount, or firearm within or on the grounds of\" any detention facility, \"unless in the course of his duty or profession, without the permission of the superintendent\" in charge of the facility.2 This former offense corresponds roughly to promoting contraband in the first degree in its coverage and penalty. The Code removes alcohol from the first degree offense, but otherwise expands the offense by including \"dangerous instruments,\" not just \"firearms.\" For example, crowbars and knives, as well as pistols, would be covered. Moreover, the statutory definition of \"harmful drug\" was \"specific\" in stating the types of drugs regarded as \"harmful.\" The Code makes the definition \"procedural\" and requires the prior approval of the supervisor of the facility. The residual second degree offense is an addition to the existing law.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §710-1022 AND 710-1023\n\nThe Proposed Draft had limited the offense of promoting prison contraband to detention facilities. When the legislature adopted the Code, it added correctional facilities to clarify that the offenses apply to diagnostic and rehabilitation programs as well as detention facilities. Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972). The legislature also raised the penalties to class B felony and class C felony, instead of class C felony and petty misdemeanor, as recommended by the Proposed Draft.\n\nAct 99, Session Laws 1976, amended §710-1022 to provide more workable definitions for materials prohibited from introduction into correctional and detention facilities. The term \"unapproved dangerous instrument or unapproved drug\" was replaced by \"dangerous instrument or drug\" and the meanings of \"dangerous instrument\" and \"drug\" were tied to the meanings set forth in §707-700(4) and §712-1240(1) to (3) and (5) to (7).\n\nAct 23, Session Laws 1999, amended §710-1023 by clarifying the definition of contraband as used for the offense of promoting prison contraband in the second degree. The legislature found that §710-1022 (relating to the offense of promoting prison contraband in the first degree) deals exclusively with dangerous instruments and drugs. Section 710-1023 (relating to the offense of promoting prison contraband in the second degree) also includes dangerous instruments and drugs within the definition of \"contraband.\" The term \"contraband\" as used in §710-1023 includes any article or thing which the inmate is prohibited by law to possess. By definition, this would include dangerous instruments or drugs which are already prohibited in §710-1022. As a result, the prohibitions in § §710-1022 and 710-1023 overlap. Under a current Hawaii supreme court ruling, if two degrees of an offense overlap, the offender must be charged with the lesser offense. As a result, §710-1022, which carries the higher class B felony penalty, is currently ineffectual and cannot be utilized by prosecutors. The legislature found that the Act clarified the ambiguity in the law and gave effect to the original legislative intent of the two provisions.

The actor has promised that the actor will appear before a certain court on a certain date. The seriousness of the breach of the covenant is directly proportional to the gravity of the offense for which the actor must answer at the appointed time. Hence, the sanctions are roughly proportional to the gravity of the offense charged: jumping bail for class A, B or C felonies is a class C felony; jumping bail for lesser offenses is a misdemeanor.\n\nHawaii previously did not have criminal penalties for forfeiture of bail. This is a reflection of the philosophy of a number of jurisdictions that rely too heavily upon the monetary sanction to secure compliance with an order to appear at some future date. Such a philosophy, when coupled with the fee required by professional bail bondsmen, may lead to disproportionately heavy bails being set for relatively poor individuals. The Code espouses a more general use of the criminal sanction for failure to appear, encouraging the release of relatively poor people either on minimal bail or on their own recognizance, and assuring the appearance of the more wealthy people who might otherwise be inclined to forfeit.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §710-1024 AND 710-1025\n\nThe Code as adopted by the legislature differs from the Proposed Draft in two respects. In §710-1024, the term \"or C\" was inserted before the term \"felony.\" Thus, a person commits the offense of bail jumping in the first degree if the person fails to appear in connection with a charge of class A or B or C felony.\n\nIn §710-1025, the term \"a Class C felony\" which was in the Proposed Draft was deleted so that the offense of bail jumping in the second degree is restricted to failure to appear involving charges of a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor only.\n\nAct 10, Session Laws 1993, amended §710-1024 to clarify that bail jumping in the first degree applies to all felonies, including murder in the first and second degrees and other nondesignated felonies specified in the Hawaii Revised Statutes other than in the Penal Code, rather than only to felonies designated as class A, B, or C. Act 10 also made the language in that section gender neutral. House Standing Committee Report No. 864, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 450.\n\nAct 17, Session Laws 2004, amended § §710-1024 and 710-1025 by lowering the state-of-mind requirement for bail jumping offenses from \"intentionally\" to \"knowingly.\" The legislature found that the change from \"intentionally\" to \"knowingly\" failing to appear may deter individuals from missing their court dates and facilitate convictions for bail jumping.

      "text": "§710-1026 Resisting arrest.(1) A person commits the offense of resisting arrest if the person intentionally prevents a law enforcement officer acting under color of the law enforcement officer's official authority from effecting an arrest by:\n\n(a) Using or threatening to use physical force against the law enforcement officer or another; or\n\n(b) Using any other means creating a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to the law enforcement officer or another.\n\n(2) Resisting arrest is a misdemeanor. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993; am L 2001, c 91, §4]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1026\n\nResisting arrest is one of the commonest forms of obstructing government operation. The Code deals specifically with resisting arrest out of a desire to confine the offense to forcible resistance that involves some substantial danger to the person. Mere non-submission ought not to be an offense. One who runs away from an arresting officer or who makes an effort to shake off the officer's detaining arm might be said to obstruct the officer physically,[1] but this type of evasion or minor scuffling is not unusual in an arrest, nor would it be desirable to make it a criminal offense to flee arrest. In this case the proper social course is to authorize police pursuit and use of reasonable force to effect the arrest. If the actor is captured, the actor may be convicted of the underlying offense. If conviction cannot be had, it would be a grave injustice to permit prosecution for an unsuccessful effort, by an innocent person, to evade the police.[2]\n\nNote that the arrest may be either of the actor or of a third person: the social and individual harms involved are the same in either case. Moreover, it is no defense to a charge under this section that the officer was making an unlawful arrest, provided the officer was acting under color of law. American jurisdictions have almost universally rejected the common-law doctrine that it is permissible to resist an unlawful arrest with as much force as one has at one's disposal. In a well-ordered society, the evils involved in allowing such resistance far outweigh the infrequent and usually minor inconvenience of submitting to any arrest made under color of law and disputing it within the legal framework. The requirement that the arrest be made under color of the officer's official authority obviates the necessity for a separate section barring such a defense.\n\nThe previous Hawaii law penalizing interference with an arresting police officer was similar to this section of the Code, except that the former law did not require the use of force or the risking of bodily injury. The penalties are roughly the same.[3]\n\nCases of interference which do not involve force or risk of bodily injury, but which present serious social dangers are included under § §710-1029 and 1030 as cases of hindering prosecution. This section of the Code is in accord with the Model Penal Code and with most recent state revisions in both definition and penalty.4\n\nResisting arrest statute not applicable where defendant's arrest was complete and defendant was in custody before fleeing police. 72 H. 360, 817 P.2d 1060 (1991).\n\nStatutory references in oral charge did not cure the omission of essential elements in resisting arrest and assault against a police officer counts of the charge. 77 H. 309, 884 P.2d 372 (1994).\n\nMentioned: 9 H.

However, in keeping with the philosophy stated in those earlier sections, liability for conduct relating to an offense which has already been consummated ought to be determined more with regard to the dangerousness of the particular post-offense acts involved than with regard to the dangerousness of the prior substantive offense. Thus, the conduct involved in these sections is treated sui generis as a form of obstructing justice. The offense of hindering prosecution focuses on the fact that the real danger involved in such conduct is that of subverting or obstructing the administration of justice.[1] The particular nature of the prior offense is important only to the extent that it is an index of the general gravity which the associated obstruction represents. However, the gravity of the obstruction is not necessarily equivalent with the gravity of the prior offense. The Code incorporates this index, to the extent that it has value, by relating the crime which the person assisted has committed to the grading of § §710-1029 and 1030.\n\nThe underlying conduct involved in these sections is that of rendering assistance to another. Such assistance is defined in terms of attempts to evade or impede justice at any stage of the apprehension, prosecution, conviction, or punishment of a potential or actual offender. Where the underlying offense is a class A, B or C felony, hindering prosecution is a class C felony. Where the underlying offense is a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor, or where culpability on the part of the other with respect to class or grade of the underlying cause cannot be proved, hindering prosecution is a misdemeanor.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law had no specific provisions equivalent to these sections. Conduct covered by these sections would have been covered, in part, under the former sections relating to principals and accessories,[2] or escape.[3] Prior coverage was spotty and inconsistent. For instance, the accessory section provided no liability for acts of concealment where the underlying offense was not punishable by imprisonment for five years or more.[4] Where an escapee was concealed or harbored, the offense was a misdemeanor5 notwithstanding the fact that the escape was punishable, under prior law, by only a three-year term.\n\nThe Code attempts to treat the offense of hindering prosecution in a general manner rather than on an ad hoc basis. Hindering the apprehension of an escapee is not treated separately; escape being an offense, one who hinders the apprehension of an escapee would come within the coverage of §710-1030. Because the conduct is treated generally, its coverage is more complete and the gradation of offenses more rational than under prior law.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §710-1028 TO 710-1030\n\nThe Code differs from the Proposed Draft in that the offense of hindering prosecution in the first degree includes assistance rendered in connection with a class C felony, as well as class A and B felonies.\n\nAct 149, Session Laws 1997, amended §710-1029 to provide that a person commits the offense of hindering prosecution in the first degree if with the intent to hinder the apprehension, prosecution, conviction, or punishment of another for murder in any degree, the person renders assistance to the other person.

      "text": "§710-1040 Bribery.(1) A person commits the offense of bribery if:\n\n(a) The person confers, or offers or agrees to confer, directly or indirectly, any pecuniary benefit upon a public servant with the intent to influence the public servant's vote, opinion, judgment, exercise of discretion, or other action in the public servant's official capacity; or\n\n(b) While a public servant, the person solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept, directly or indirectly, any pecuniary benefit with the intent that the person's vote, opinion, judgment, exercise of discretion, or other action as a public servant will thereby be influenced.\n\n(2) It is a defense to a prosecution under subsection (1) that the accused conferred or agreed to confer the pecuniary benefit as a result of extortion or coercion.\n\n(3) For purposes of this section, \"public servant\" includes in addition to persons who occupy the position of public servant as defined in section [710-1000], persons who have been elected, appointed, or designated to become a public servant although not yet occupying that position.\n\n(4) Bribery is a class B felony. A person convicted of violating this section, notwithstanding any law to the contrary, shall not be eligible for a deferred acceptance of guilty plea or nolo contendere plea under chapter 853. [L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993; am L 2006, c 230, §47]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1040\n\nIn most cases, bribery subverts the efficient functioning of the government to the benefit of a private individual, or a limited class of individuals. Efficiency is undermined because those choices and decisions which are the job of public servants cease to be made solely on the basis of merit, and hence the chance that the alternative most beneficial to the functioning of the government, or to the people collectively, is decreased. The pervasive and far-reaching nature of this offense against public administration warrants the class C felony sanction.\n\nMoreover, both parties to bribery are obviously to be considered culpable, one no less than the other. The victim of this offense is usually the public in general, although in particular instances (particularly competitive bid and judicial or quasi-judicial situations) individuals may suffer more directly. Subsection (1)(a) covers the offeror of the bribe, while subsection (1)(b) covers the offeree.\n\nThe defense provided for in subsection (2) is intended to allow the actor who commits bribery as a result of extortion or coercion to have the opportunity to raise these facts as a defense. As with all defenses in this Code which are not made affirmative, once the issue is raised, the prosecution must negate it beyond a reasonable doubt. It is questionable whether the sections on duress ( §702-231) or choice of evils ( §703-302) adequately cover this situation. Therefore, the defense is specifically provided for by this subsection.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law recognized bribery as a criminal offense, but treated bribe giving as a lesser offense than bribe receiving,1 which carried approximately the same penalty as that provided by the Code. The Code equalizes the penalties. In defining the offense the Code requires that the actor have the intent to influence or the intent to be influenced. Previous law required that, in case of bribery receiving, the actor act \"corruptly\" and with an \"understanding.\" Under the Code, intent is the relevant state of mind. The Code requires that the actor solicit, accept, or agree to accept the pecuniary benefit with intent that the actor will thereby be influenced. As in the inchoate offense of conspiracy, the Code takes the unilateral approach to penal liability: the offer may be feigned, or made innocently, but if the receiver intended to be influenced thereby liability attaches, notwithstanding an absence of an agreement or understanding.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1040\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended bribery from a class C to a class B felony, and provided that a person convicted of bribery shall not be eligible for a deferred acceptance of guilty plea or nolo contendere plea under chapter 853.\n\nPlaintiffs failed to establish genuine issue of fact whether five million dollar gift to city and county of Honolulu was a bribe; plaintiffs raised genuine issue of fact whether campaign contributions were bribes. 906 F.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993; am L 2014, c 33, §6; am L 2019, c 114, §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §710-1060 TO 710-1063\n\nEfficiency and fairness of governmental operations and public confidence in public administration, in general, and the administration of justice, in particular, require that information which the government relies upon not be falsified. Yet a general, undifferentiated penalty for all falsification to governmental authorities would not reflect contemporary social mores.\n\nFalse testimony and other misleading information to officials can convert governmental power into an instrument of injustice rather than justice, with unfortunate consequences not only for the individual whose life, freedom or property may be affected, but also for the community's general sense of security and confidence in the state. On the other hand, not all lying to officials can usefully or safely be made criminal. Measures other than punishment are our principal reliance against falsehood in judicial and other proceedings, where cross-examination and the opportunity to produce evidence on both sides of any issue facilitate the process of arriving at truth.[1]\n\nIt has been noted that a great difficulty in the law of perjury has been the severity of the penalties specified by the statutes; \"in some situations falsification to officials is so widely practiced and tolerated by prevailing moral standards that severe penalties would be unrealistic.\"[2] For example, a person may claim domicile in a state in order to obtain a divorce when the person's real intent is to satisfy the minimum requirement of physical presence and to leave the state as soon as the decree is obtained. It is essential to distinguish between minor and more aggravated forms of false swearing.\n\nGeneral analysis.These sections divide falsification into four different offenses of three different grades depending on the presence of aggravating circumstances.\n\nThe offense of perjury, a class C felony, requires (a) a false statement which the court determines to be \"material,\" (b) made under an oath, (c) in an official proceeding. This is the most serious offense and the only felony in this part. Other forms of falsification, whether under oath or not, are graded as misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors. Falsification before a court, legislative committee, administrative agency, or other official proceeding, as defined in §710-1000(12), is deemed more culpable and more socially dangerous than similar falsity in a report, license application, or like matter, especially when these types of statements are often prepared by a lawyer.[3]\n\nA false statement made under oath may constitute a misdemeanor if (a) it is made in an official proceeding, or (b) it is made with intent to mislead a public servant in the performance of the public servant's official duty. The statement need not be a \"materially false statement.\" The offense is labeled false swearing to authorities.\n\nFalse swearing, a residual offense, makes all other false statements, made under an oath required or authorized by law, a petty misdemeanor. In addition to other cases, this offense would cover falsification in a written statement which, pursuant to a requirement or authorization of law, has been sworn to before a notary, in a strictly private transaction. It would also cover a false affidavit filed with the government but not in an official proceeding, regardless of materiality or intent to mislead.\n\nThe final offense in this quartet does not require that the statement be under oath. Indeed, that statement need not be written; the falsification can be in the form of submission of, or invitation to rely on, false samples, specimens, maps, boundary-marks, or other objects. However, the falsification must be made with intent to mislead a public servant in the performance of the public servant's official duty.\n\nMens rea with respect to the truth of the statement.Under the offenses in this part, a defendant is not held liable for a false statement made inadvertently or out of ignorance. For penal liability to occur, the defendant's state of mind with regard to the truth of the statement must be a lack of an affirmative belief in the truth of the matter asserted. The defendant need not know the falsity of the statement, it would be sufficient for conviction if the defendant had no belief with regard to the statement's truthfulness. The defendant may have no idea whether or not the defendant's statement is true; but a lack of belief that it is true will support a conviction. The state of mind required is, in effect, a reckless disregard of the truth of the matter asserted. However, the requisite culpability is not expressed with the word \"reckless\" because applying that word, as defined in §702-206(3), presents certain difficulties when applied to the falsification offenses of this part. As the commentary to the Model Penal Code explains the problem:\n\nWe have chosen to specify the mental state of lack of belief, in this section, rather than rely on the general definition of \"recklessness\" in [Section 702-206(3)], for two reasons. First, it requires considerable mental agility to construe [Section 702-206(3)] as applied to perjury, and second, we are satisfied that once lack of belief is established, no further inquiry into \"justification\" or \"degree of culpability\" would be useful.[4]\n\nThe nature of the oath requirement.The requirement or authorization of an oath is an implied instruction by the legislature to the individual making the statement that the information requested is of special significance, and that special sanctions will attend any falsifications. Since the oath's significance rests partially upon the legislative directive, it follows that an oath which is attended by penal sanctions ought to be one which is specifically required or authorized by law.[5] A public servant or private individual could not, as a matter of local policy or individual whim, require an oath without any basis in law and thereby make falsifications thereunder subject to these sanctions.\n\nSection 710-1000(10), defining \"oath,\" is specifically designed to provide government agencies with a convenient method of demanding the truth in applications and registrations without resort to cumbersome procedures of requiring oaths before notaries. With regard to the function of these falsification offenses, it should not matter whether the State's special emphasis on receiving truthful information is indicated by a requirement of an oath or affirmation, or by written notice on a government form. The notice of special significance of the requested information and the warning of special sanctions are the same in either case.\n\nMateriality; intent to mislead.Materiality with regard to a false statement (required for a perjury conviction) and an intent to mislead a public servant (required for one form of false swearing in official matters and for all forms of unsworn falsification to authorities) are similar in their functional role: each limits the application of an offense when the falsification is not likely to obstruct justice or which is trivial. On the other hand, the terms are not synonymous. A person may not intend to mislead, yet the person's falsification may be material.\n\nMateriality of the falsification distinguishes perjury, a felony, from the lesser offenses in this part. Given the requisite state of mind with regard to truthfulness of the statement, falsification, in an official proceeding, which is material, constitutes the greatest risk of obstruction of justice. A \"materially false statement\" means:\n\nany false statement, regardless of its admissibility under the rules of evidence, which could have affected the course or outcome of the proceeding.[6]\n\nSection 710-1060 holds the actor strictly liable with regard to the actor's knowledge of a false statement's materiality. Materiality is not made an element of the offense; it is not a fact which the trier of fact must find, but a question of law for the court to determine.[7] Beyond the difficulty of proving a culpable state of mind with regard to this factor, the importance of the examination of witnesses in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings is such that it is extremely unwise to allow a witness to decide what may or may not be material. Witnesses are usually not qualified to make judgments on materiality in the technical sense in which that concept is here employed. A crucial quality of an official proceeding, as defined in §710-1000(12), is that the hearing presents the \"opportunity to test the credibility of witnesses by questioning that may begin, or wander, far from the central theme.\"[8] As the commentary to the Proposed Michigan Criminal Code states:\n\nA witness who falsifies an answer to a quite distant question he considers irrelevant may be blocking the eventual trial to relevant truth, thereby defeating one of the principal values of the hearing. Where, on the other hand, the false statement is made on a written application or report submitted to the government, there is considerably less likelihood that the actor will be confused about the materiality of the information given.[9]\n\nOne form of false swearing to authorities, §710-1061(1)(b), and all forms of unsworn falsification to authorities, §710-1063, require that the actor have an intent to mislead a public servant in the performance of the public servant's official duty. The falsification need not be material, but the actor's intent is crucial. Trivial falsifications which (1) do not impair the examination process of an official proceeding, and (2) are not intended to mislead the public servant, do not warrant the misdemeanor sanction. These falsifications are penalized, if at all, as false swearing ( §710-1062), a petty misdemeanor.\n\nThe nature of the statement required.\"Statement\" is defined in §710-1000(16) to mean:\n\nany representation, but includes a representation of opinion, belief, or other state of mind only if the representation clearly relates to state of mind apart from or in addition to any facts which are the subject of the representation.\n\nA prosecution for perjury or other offense defined by this part can be based on a statement of opinion or belief. The definition of \"statement\" is intended, however, to preclude liability based on the following logic: (1) the declarant states that X is so; (2) the declarant's statement includes, implicitly, a statement that the declarant believes X to be so; (3) although there is no evidence that X is not so, the declarant may be liable because the declarant did not believe X to be so. \"The possibility of such prosecutions is disquieting.... [T]he making of true statements which the declarant believes to be false can hardly obstruct justice....\"[10]\n\nPrevious Hawaii law.Previous Hawaii law defined perjury as \"wilfully, knowingly and falsely stating... some material fact on oath where the oath is required or authorized by law.\"[11] While there has been very little judicial interpretation of the requirements of \"wilfully, knowingly and falsely,\" stating the fact, the potential confusion with regard to (1) the meaning of \"wilfully,\" as it relates or adds to \"knowingly,\" and (2) the actor's knowledge of the statement's materiality or falsity, is largely obviated by the language of the Code. The Code provides a needed definition of \"materiality\" which is in substantial accord with court interpretation of that requirement.[12] Like the Code, previous law provided that the oath must be authorized or required by law.[13]\n\nThe former sanction of a possible twenty years' imprisonment[14] seems entirely disproportionate to the severity of the offense. Especially in light of the above discussion of overly severe penalties, a maximum penalty which is equivalent to the Code's penalty for murder, rape in the first degree, and kidnapping, probably tends more to undermine certainty of application than it does to deter perjury. As the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has said:\n\n[A] great difficulty in administering the law of perjury has been the severity of the penalties specified by the statutes. In the less aggravated forms of perjury, much could be gained in effectiveness and respect by making penalties less severe in the books and more frequently applied in the court rooms.[15]\n\nThe Code's class C felony sanction for perjury is in accord with that of the Model Penal Code and recent penal revisions.[16]\n\nNo provision is made in this Code for subornation of perjury.[17] Such cases are adequately covered by the sections dealing with solicitation.[18] Furthermore, if perjury is committed following the solicitation, the suborner will be liable for the offense of perjury itself on the basis of the suborner's complicity in, and responsibility for, the conduct of the declarant.19\n\nUnder previous Hawaii law, all false swearing was either punished as perjury, or not at all. The Code adds to the law two lesser offenses, and grades the falsifications according to the culpability of the defendant and the tendency of the falsification to subvert the administration of justice or the performance of official duty. The Code also adds an offense covering unsworn falsification to authorities. These three new offenses cover wide gaps in the prior law relating to falsification.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §710-1060 TO 710-1063\n\nAct 33, Session Laws 2014, amended §710-1063 to apply to electronic statements, documents, or records. The legislature found that many government and business records are kept in electronic form. However, the current law prohibited only the alteration of records kept in written form. In 2000, Hawaii adopted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, chapter 489E, to recognize the need to establish the legal validity of electronic records, signatures, and contracts. Act 33 protected consumers by making relevant criminal offenses also applicable to electronic statements, documents, or records. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3330, House Standing Committee Report No. 260-14.\n\nAct 114, Session Laws 2019, amended §710-1063 to amend the misdemeanor offense of unsworn falsification to authorities to include knowingly making a false statement to a state investigator or county inspector during an investigation into compliance with state or county laws, rules, or regulations. The legislature found that the enforcement of county ordinances and state agency rules is often undermined by a lack of consequences for failure to comply with enforcement efforts. The legislature further found that this difficulty in enforcement can result in, for example, the construction of large, multi-unit \"monster homes\" and the operation of vacation rentals without regard to building codes, zoning codes, and tax laws. Act 114 assisted enforcement efforts by helping to deter individuals from providing false information to authorities conducting investigations.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1064\n\nPrevious Hawaii law contained no provision or case dealing with the problems of retraction. The common-law rule is that while retraction may be used to show inadvertence in making the statement, perjury once committed cannot be purged even by a correction during the same hearing.[1]\n\nThe rationale underlying this section is that it is socially desirable to keep the door open to a defense as an incentive for a witness to correct the witness' misstatement and tell the truth before the end of the proceeding.\n\n[In the Proposed Draft, subsection (2) provided: \"Statements made in separate hearings at separate stages of the same official or administrative proceeding shall be deemed to have been made in the course of the same proceeding.\" The Commentary herein is based on the Proposed Draft.]\n\nSubsection (1)(a) requires that, if the falsification was made in a proceeding, the retraction must be made in the course of the same proceeding. Subsection (2) ensures that the phrase \"in the course of the same proceeding\" will be sufficiently broadly defined to encompass hearings at separate stages of a proceeding. Perjury committed at a preliminary hearing, for example, could be offset by retraction at the subsequent trial. Also, the retraction must be made before discovery of the falsification becomes known to the actor. This requirement is intended to deny the benefits of retraction to the person whose falsification has already been discovered and who, knowing the discovery, seeks to avoid liability by retraction. The necessity for so providing is the danger that otherwise a liberal retraction defense will encourage falsification. In discussing a claim that retraction even after discovery should constitute a defense, the United States Supreme Court said:\n\nThe argument overlooks the tendency of such a view to encourage false swearing in the belief that if the falsity be not discovered before the end of the hearing it will have its intended effect, but, if discovered, the witness may purge himself of crime by resuming his role as witness and substituting the truth for his previous falsehood.2\n\nThe language in subsection (1)(a) allows retraction while avoiding this problem.\n\nSubsection (1)(b) deals with falsification not made in a proceeding. Here, the test of \"reliance\" is used in determining whether any harm has occurred. It is difficult to see a point in punishing the actor where no State agency or employee has relied upon the falsification in ordering State action or in disbursing State funds.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1064\n\nThe Code as adopted by the legislature differs from the Proposed Draft in the wording of subsection (2). The Proposed Draft had provided that statements made in separate hearings at separate stages of the same official or administrative proceeding shall be deemed to be made in the course of the same proceeding. The legislature felt that as a defense, that proposal may provide too many avenues to avoid prosecution for perjury or any other related offense. Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972). Thus, subsection (2) now states that \"in the course of the same proceeding\" includes separate hearings at separate stages of the same official or administrative proceeding, but does not include any stage of the proceeding after the close of the evidence.\n\n§710-1064 Commentary:\n\n1.

The unwitting maker of contradictory statements will be protected by the requirement that the attendant circumstances and requisite state of mind be proved with regard to each statement. Note also that where two contradictory statements carry different sanctions, the declarant may only be convicted of the lesser offense under this section.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law contained no specific provisions for inconsistent statements, nor are there any reported Hawaii cases on this point.\n\n§710-1065 Commentary:\n\n1.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1066\n\nThe basic problem with which this section attempts to deal is concisely stated by the commentary to the Model Penal Code:\n\nIt has been argued, nearly always unsuccessfully, that a defendant who has once been acquitted of a substantive offense ought not to be tried for perjury committed in defending that prosecution, at least where the perjury was as to the \"core\" of guilt in the first trial. Double jeopardy does not bar the perjury prosecution, since the offenses are different, and honest testimony under oath must be insisted upon even in the case of persons defending themselves against charges of crime. The doctrine of res judicata does not preclude conviction, even where conviction would seem to require direct contradiction of the acquittal of the original prosecution.[1]\n\nThe Model Penal Code goes on to admit that there is \"almost no escape from the dilemma of either giving immunity to perjury by defendants or permitting the opportunity for abusive retrials of the original charge.\"[2]\n\nThere are, however, some constitutional grounds for barring such prosecutions. In one case,3 a prosecution for false unsworn statements to FBI agents was dismissed on the ground, among others, that it would be a violation of due process to abandon the substantive charges against the defendants and subsequently indict them for previously denying their complicity therein.\n\nThe Code takes the position that this section will serve the worthwhile purpose of implementing the basic policy underlying our double jeopardy prohibition by forbidding a retrial of a substantive offense through the guise of a falsification charge and by barring a prosecution of a substantive offense the denial of which was the subject of a former falsification prosecution. Both prohibitions are necessary to ensure the desired result. If the section were only to bar a falsification prosecution subsequent to the prosecution of the substantive offense, there would be nothing to prevent the State from merely prosecuting the falsification offense first, and then the substantive offense the denial of which led to the first prosecution.\n\nThe section, as drafted, leaves open the possibility of prosecuting for false statements on collateral or subsidiary issues. The prohibition of prosecution only runs where the substance of the alleged false statement is a denial of guilt for an offense.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law had no provisions dealing with this problem, nor are there any reported Hawaii cases on this point.\n\n§710-1066 Commentary:\n\n1.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1067\n\nThis section forbids convictions for perjury based solely upon the contradictory testimony of a single witness. Either some additional corroborating evidence or the contradictory testimony of an additional witness is needed for conviction.\n\nThe rationale for this rule is that the requirement is necessary as a safeguard to induce witnesses to testify freely.[1] Obtaining voluntary testimony in any proceeding would be difficult if the witness might be harassed upon the word of a disappointed litigant.[2] And if the witness were required to testify, it would seem that similar protection ought to be given the witness.\n\nThe policy question to be decided, then, is whether the overall protection and encouragement of persons who give statements (in the contexts specified by the offenses in this part) is worth foregoing occasionally the conviction of an apparent falsifier. The Code takes the position that it is. There is also an additional safeguard involved in protecting the innocent person. The protection rests upon the argument that since equally honest persons may well have different recollections of the same events, a conviction for a falsification offense ought not to rest upon the contradiction of two statements. Otherwise, an innocent person would be subject to prosecution every time another person, under oath, disputed the innocent person's recollection.[3]\n\nThis section would apply only to a relatively narrow class of cases which would not often be prosecuted. The section operates only where there is no evidence but the testimony of a single contradicting witness. Hence, one may view this section as a special gloss on the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, equivalent to stating that no case of a contradicting statement under oath, without more, can satisfy the general requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in falsification cases.[4]\n\nThe Hawaii case law is that a person accused of perjury may be convicted only upon the testimony of two credible witnesses, or of one credible witness corroborated by other evidence sufficient to satisfy the trier of fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, as to the guilt of the accused.5 Here, the Code is essentially in accord with the Hawaii rule, but codifies it, lends it greater clarity, and extends it to all falsification offenses in this part.\n\n§710-1067 Commentary:\n\n1.

The same result would probably be reached by court interpretation; however, to avoid confusion this section deals with these defenses specifically.\n\nSubsection (1) precludes a defense based on the incompetency of a defendant to give certain testimony. This subsection does not apply where the incompetency is based on a complete lack of penal responsibility (i.e., the defenses to penal liability provided by chapter 704.).\n\nSubsection (2) precludes a defense based on the inadmissibility, under the rules of evidence, of the false testimony. For example, a defendant in a perjury prosecution could not claim that, because a correct application of the rules of evidence would have precluded the defendant's testimony as being hearsay or irrelevant, the defendant is not guilty of the falsification offense. This subsection follows logically from the definition of \"materially false statement\" in §710-1000(9), which separates \"materiality\" from \"admissibility.\" \"These provisions are based on the same basic principle that once a person's testimony is admitted he cannot excuse his perjury on the ground that the testimony was subject to objection and should have been excluded in the first instance.\"[1]\n\nSubsection (3) states the general rule that irregularities in the administration of the oath are not a defense to falsification under oath.\n\nSection[s 710-1060, 1061, and 1062] deal with statements under oath or affirmation. The guiding principle is that when the community commands or authorizes certain statements to be made with special formality or on notice of special sanction, the seriousness of the demand for honesty is sufficiently evident to warrant application of criminal sanctions. Oath, affirmation for those with religious or other scruples against oaths, or--under Section [710-1000(10)]--notice that the state means to apply criminal penalties to misstatements, should suffice. Technical irregularities in the administration of the oath are of no concern to the defendant, as we have expressly provided in subsection (3).[2]\n\nSubsection (4) \"is designed to deal with a situation where the oath was taken as required by law, but was administered by a person who lacked authority to do so,\"[3] such as a notary whose commission expired. The Code precludes a defense to falsification under such circumstances.\n\nPrevious Hawaii statutory law was silent on the subjects covered in this section. The case law has not dealt with the subjects covered by subsections (1) and (2), is in accord with subsection (3),[4] and is, in an old case, contrary to subsection (4).5 The Code, in this section, represents an addition to the law and a slight modification of an old decision.\n\n§710-1068 Commentary:\n\n1.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1070\n\nAs stated in the commentary to perjury and related offenses,[1] the integrity of the witness' testimony is one of the fundamental requisites of our jurisprudential system. However, unlike the case of perjury, attention is here focused upon the step prior to perjury, the inducement for the offense. It is the risk of unreliable and false testimony that is the harm sought to be prevented.\n\nIt is apparent that substantial interference with any part of the process whereby a witness is called to testify in an official proceeding is to be condemned. And since each part of the process is of unique importance in assuring the availability and integrity of the witness, it follows that the sanction ought to be the same regardless of which part of this process is obstructed or perverted. Therefore, it is made an offense to interfere, by means of conferring or receiving a benefit with either testimony, service of process, or appearance at the proceeding.\n\nNote that the person whom the actor attempts to induce need not actually be a witness, but may merely be one whom the actor believes is about to be called as a witness. This provision is to avoid confusion as to when an individual actually becomes a witness, thus foreclosing specious defenses and emphasizing that the harm inheres in the attempt to interfere with the course of the official proceeding.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law recognized bribery of a witness as a form of suppressing evidence.2 The section on suppressing evidence, a misdemeanor offense, covered only evading the giving of testimony and suppressing other forms of evidence. Also, it apparently covered only the bribe giver and not the receiver. The misdemeanor sanction was not consistent with the sanction of twenty years' imprisonment permitted by previous law for subornation of perjury. Under this Code, the class C felony sentence provided for the offenses defined in this section is the same as that imposed for perjury.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1070\n\nThe Code as adopted differs from the Proposed Draft in that the title of the section was changed to \"bribery of or by a witness\" from \"bribery of a witness.\"\n\nThe leap from asking a potential witness to \"not show up\" or to \"not show up and testify\" to the conclusion that a defendant thereby intended to induce that witness to avoid service of process was untenable in light of the structure of this section; thus, there was insufficient evidence to lead a person of reasonable caution to the conclusion that defendant intended to induce witness to avoid service of process under subsection (1)(b). 117 H. 218, 177 P.3d 928 (2008).\n\n§710-1070 Commentary:\n\n1. § §710-1060, 1061.\n\n2.

Note, however, that only the person who directs the force or threat against the witness is guilty of a crime. \"Threat,\" as used in this section is any threat proscribed by the offense of criminal coercion under §707-724.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §710-1072\n\nThe social harm dealt with in this section is the same as that dealt with in the prior two sections, however, the means specified in the definition of this offense (i.e., conduct intended to induce) are not as culpable as in the former sections, hence tampering with a witness is only graded as a misdemeanor. A person who attempts to affect testimony, or the absence of it, by, e.g., persuasion or trickery, as opposed to bribery or intimidation, does not commit an offense grave enough to be condemned as a felony. However, unlike the sections on witness bribery and intimidation,[1] an attempt to induce a prospective witness to avoid process is not made an offense: this is because neither the means nor the end is illegal in itself.2\n\nPrevious Hawaii law recognized no offense equivalent to tampering with a witness. And, though it is conceivable that such conduct could have been penalized under the general contempt power of the court, there appear no reported cases on the point.\n\n§710-1072 Commentary:\n\n1. § §710-1070 and 1071, respectively.\n\n2.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; gen ch 1993]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §710-1073 TO 710-1075\n\nThese three sections parallel closely § §710-1070, 1071, and 1072 dealing with witness bribery, intimidation, and tampering. The only significant difference from the preceding sections lies in the fact that the integrity of a slightly different part of the judicial process is being protected. It is, however, readily apparent that the juror plays a part in the judicial process of equal importance with that of the witness; the integrity of the juror's function must be protected equally. Since it is the juror's function to decide the facts according to the evidence without any external influences or considerations, it is the imposition of such external influences which is penalized by these three sections. Both the structure of the sections and the sanctions imposed are similar to those described in the preceding witness offenses.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law defined bribery of a juror in a generally similar manner to §710-1073, except that the offenses of offeror and of recipient were penalized differently. One who bribed a juror could receive a $500 fine or a two-year term of imprisonment,[1] whereas the juror who accepted a bribe was subject to a fine of $1,000 or a term of five years' imprisonment.[2] The reason for the distinction between the penalties for offeror and recipient remains unarticulated in other statutes and in judicial interpretation. The consolidation and equal treatment of the two offenses under §710-1073 is based upon the general premise that the sentence should be based upon the danger of harm to society, the magnitude of that harm, and the culpability of the actor. As the offenses are defined in §710-1073, both offeror and recipient would be equal with respect to all three criteria of punishment; therefore, they are graded equally.\n\nThe previous law did not deal specifically with intimidation of witnesses or tampering with witnesses as those offenses are defined in the Code. Previous sections on \"corruptly influencing\" a juror[3] and \"intimidation of ... any ... officer charged with any duty in the administration ... of the law ...\"4 might have been employed. However, the difficulty in applying such non-specific language is readily apparent.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §710-1073 TO 710-1075\n\nThe legislature changed the title of §710-1073 to \"Bribery of or by a juror.\" The Proposed Draft had provided \"Bribery of a juror.\" The Code differs from the Proposed Draft in that the offense of intimidating a juror under §710-1074 is raised from a class C to a class B felony; and the offense of jury tampering under §710-1075 is raised from a misdemeanor to a class C felony. The penalties were increased because of the central role which the judicial process serves in the preservation of society.

In both cases, the actor must have an intent that the concealment or falsification should have an effect in the proceeding. \"Physical evidence\" is defined principally to distinguish it from that evidence which is offered as testimony by witnesses.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law dealt with the offense of tampering with physical evidence under the general heading of supressing evidence.[1] The prior law provided that any person who \"destroys, conceals, or suppresses any deposition or other legal evidence in any suit or proceeding...\"[2] would be subject to a misdemeanor penalty.

Perkins has said \"a large part of it is clearly outside the area of criminal law and much of the rest hardly more than 'quasi-criminal.'\"[1] The contempt proceeding has been called \"'an anomaly,' a mixture of the attributes of the criminal process and those of the equity proceeding.\"[2]\n\nNot the least source of confusion is the various classifications of contempt depending on (1) the type of penalty imposed (civil or criminal), and (2) the proximity of behavior penalized to the judicial proceeding with which it interferes (direct or constructive).\n\nCivil contempt is disobedience to a court order; it is punished by a penalty which is coercive and corrective in nature; the penalty can be avoided by compliance with the court order. For example, for refusal of a witness to answer a proper question, the court may order the witness imprisoned until the witness answers. Criminal contempt is conduct which brings the court into disrespect or which interferes with the administration of justice. The penalty for criminal contempt is a sentence or order which the defendant cannot avoid. Insulting behavior toward the court or an assault on a bailiff would constitute two modes of criminal contempt, for which a court might impose a sentence of imprisonment for a certain period of time. Certain contempt may be both civil and criminal if both types of dispositions are appropriate. Refusal to answer a proper question may be penalized as both criminal and civil contempt; the court may, e.g., order the contemnor to be imprisoned for one day and to be imprisoned thereafter until the contemnor answers the question.\n\nIt is often said that a direct contempt is one which takes place in the presence of the court or so near the court as to interfere with judicial proceedings. An indirect or constructive contempt is contempt committed at a distance from the court or proceedings but which degrades the court or interferes with its proceedings. Although couched in substantive terms, the consequences of the distinction are largely procedural. If the contempt is direct, the court may impose punishment summarily, whereas if the contempt is constructive, due process requires that the court issue an order to show cause and hold a hearing thereon before punishment is imposed. This being the case, a more rational \"determinant insofar as procedure is concerned is whether or not the contempt was committed under such circumstances that the judge has knowledge of all the facts and hence has no need to hear evidence.\"[3]\n\nAlthough often challenged, the United States Supreme Court had held, until recently, mostly on historical grounds,[4] that contempt proceedings were not intended by the framers of the Constitution to be within the constitutional guarantees of trial by jury,[5] and that \"it has always been the law of the land, both state and federal, that the courts--except where specifically precluded by statute--have the power to proceed summarily in contempt matters.\"[6]\n\nIn a recent series of opinions, the Court has redefined the nature of contempt and its relation to constitutional procedural guarantees. In United States v. Barnett (1964),[7] Cheff v. Schnackenburg (1966),[8] Bloom v. Illinois (1968),[9] and Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co. (1968)[10] the Court has gradually, and in increments, adopted the position that: (1) the Constitution's criminal jury trial provisions apply to serious offenses and not to petty offenses;[11] (2) criminal contempt \"is a crime in every fundamental respect\" and, for purposes of the constitutional guarantees to trial by jury in criminal cases, it will be treated the same as other criminal offenses;[12] and (3) where the criminal contempt constitutes a serious offense, the Constitution guarantees the right to trial by jury, where the criminal contempt constitutes a petty offense, it does not.[13]\n\nThe Court has distinguished the severity of the penalty authorized or imposed from the seriousness of the offense committed.[14] However, this appears to be a distinction without a difference, because a majority of the Court appear to accept as the best, if not the only, evidence of the seriousness of the offense the penalty authorized or imposed.[15] Although \"the exact location of the line between petty offenses and serious crimes\" is not settled,[16] a majority of the Court appear to accept the position that where the maximum term of imprisonment may not exceed six months a jury trial is not guaranteed by the Federal Constitution in criminal contempt cases.[17]\n\nJustices Black and Douglas have taken the position that a defendant charged with criminal contempt is entitled, under the Federal Constitution, to a trial by jury.[18] Whether this position results from their characterization of criminal contempt as a serious crime, or from the belief that any imprisonment is a severe penalty which cannot be imposed without trial by jury, is not clear.[19]\n\nThe procedural right to trial by jury in cases of criminal contempt, where \"severe\" punishment is authorized and the offense therefore regarded as \"serious,\" which the Supreme Court has imposed on the states as a matter of constitutional law, has long been recognized by statute in Hawaii.[20] Previous Hawaii law limited the punishment which may be imposed if the Court proceeded summarily without a jury.[21]\n\nSection 710-1077 attempts to preserve as much of the framework of the previous chapter on contempts[22] as is possible, and at the same time, to clarify and, in some instances, expand the statutory law.\n\nSubsection (1) spells out more clearly than the previous code the types of conduct regarded as contumacious. Subsections (1)(a), (1)(b), (1)(g), and (1)(h) are clarifications of former law. Each subsection states specifically the mental culpability required for conviction. Contempt in open court under subsection (1)(a) may be committed recklessly; however, under subsection (1)(b) [breach of the peace], (1)(g) [disobedience or resistance to process, injunction, or mandate], and (1)(h) [refusal to be qualified as a witness or answer proper interrogatory] the actor must act intentionally.\n\nSubsection (1)(d) limits contempt by publication to one who \"knowingly publishes a false report of a court's proceedings.\" The Code eliminates language contained in the previous codification which could be interpreted to penalize as contemptuous constitutionally protected publications.[23]\n\nSubsections (1)(c) [violation of duty or order by officer of court], (1)(e) [unauthorized practice before a court], (1)(f) [recording deliberation of a jury], and (1)(i) [failure of juror to attend trial or official proceeding] are additions to statutory law. Although similar types of behavior have been held to constitute criminal contempt under case law development,[24] the Code proposes codification of conduct regarded as contempt of court. The policy against common-law crimes also weighs heavily against the unrestrained common-law development of loose statutory standards.\n\nSubsection (2) makes the offense a misdemeanor; a slight reduction in the two years' imprisonment previously authorized.[25] As in the case of all misdemeanors the offense is triable as a criminal offense, i.e., by a jury unless jury trial is waived.\n\nSubsection (3) preserves the court's power to dispose of criminal contempts without a jury trial; however, in such cases, the offense must be treated as a petty misdemeanor. The Code makes no distinction, as does the prior law,[26] in the summary punishment which may be imposed by State Supreme, Circuit, and District Courts. The Code's lowest grade of criminal offense, petty misdemeanor, seems easily within the Supreme Court's concept of \"petty offense.\" Disposition of an offense under subsection (3) would not, therefore, violate the defendant's constitutional right to trial by jury. Moreover, the division of subsection (3) into two parts provides due process in another respect. Subsection (3)(b) assures that where the contempt is not direct, i.e., not in the immediate view and presence of the court, nor under such circumstances that the court has knowledge of all the facts constituting the offense, the defendant must be charged, and, if tried, proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nA majority of the United States Supreme Court has rejected, repeatedly, the position taken by Black and Douglas, JJ., in their dissents in Barnett, Cheff, and Dyke, that a jury trial is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution in all criminal contempt cases. We have considered implementing by statute this policy in favor of jury trials. However, it seems to us that, on the balance, the value in permitting the court to proceed without a jury, in cases where the offense is treated as a petty misdemeanor, outweighs the value of enlarging the defendant's right to jury trial. A contrary decision would force the court, in some instances, to be a witness in its own behalf--a status it would be ill-suited and loath to assume.\n\nSubsection (4) provides that contempts which constitute both contempt and another offense do not relieve the defendant of liability for the other offense merely because its commission was contemptuous of the court. For example, if a person were to cause disorder in a courtroom, during the course of proceedings, by assaulting another person, the person would be guilty of contempt. The person would also be guilty of an assault. The fact that the court imposed summary punishment for the contempt, or the fact that the person was put in jeopardy for the misdemeanor offense of criminal contempt of court, would not allow the defendant to plead double jeopardy to a charge of assault based on the same conduct. Any danger presented by the possibility of multiplicity of convictions is obviated somewhat by the limitation in chapter 706 against ordering that sentences be served consecutively.\n\nSubsection (5) is a concise restatement of former law,[27] with the exception that it eliminates the restriction against district courts trying cases of constructive contempt.\n\nSubsection (6) explicitly preserves the court's power to deal with cases of civil contempt and is otherwise a restatement of prior law.28\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1077\n\nAct 136, Session Laws 1973, amended subsection (5) by amending the last sentence of the first paragraph and by adding the second paragraph. Prior to amendment, the last sentence of the first paragraph read: \"A conviction under subsection (3)(a) shall not be subject to review by direct appeal.\"\n\nAct 181, Session Laws 1979, amended subsection (1) and added subsection (7) as part of an effort to provide a remedy to abate as nuisances, certain offenses against public health and morals.\n\nAct 157, Session Laws 2008, amended subsection (6) to provide that when a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order compelling a parent to furnish the parent's child with support, proof that the order was made, filed, and served on the parent or that the parent was present in court at the time the order was pronounced, and that the parent did not comply with the order, shall constitute prima facie evidence of a civil contempt of court. Act 157 clarified that if an order of civil contempt based on prima facie evidence imposes immediate imprisonment, the order shall set forth the conditions that must be met for release from imprisonment. The Act also clarified that civil contempt of court may be established by means other than by prima facie evidence. Act 157 facilitated the proof of civil contempt of court in proceedings involving enforcement of a court order compelling a parent to pay child support, medical support, or other remedial care for the parent's child. Conference Committee Report No. 21-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 873.\n\nAct 35, Session Laws 2015, amended subsection (6) by changing the paragraph designations and subsection (7) by making technical nonsubstantive amendments.\n\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\nContemporary Contempt: The State of the Law in Hawaii.

Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 198 note 2 (1968).\n\n5. Article III, §2, of the Constitution provides that \"[t]he Trial of all Crimes, except in cases of Impeachment, shall be by jury....\" The Sixth Amendment states that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury....\" The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments forbid the federal government and the states from depriving a person of \"life, liberty or property without due process of law.\"\n\n6. United States v. Barnett, 376 U.S. 681, 692, rehearing denied, 377 U.S. 973 (1964). See also Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 183-187 (1958), and the cases collected therein.\n\n7.

Illinois, supra at 201-202.\n\n14. United States v. Barnett, supra at 694 note 12.\n\n15. In a note to Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 162 (1968), the Court said: \"Cheff involved criminal contempt, an offense applied to a wide range of conduct including conduct not so serious as to require jury trial absent a long sentence. In addition criminal contempt is unique in that legislative bodies frequently authorize punishment without stating the extent of the penalty which can be imposed. The contempt statute under which Cheff was prosecuted, 18 U.S.C. §401, treated the extent of punishment as a matter to be determined by the forum court. It is therefore understandable that this Court in Cheff seized upon the penalty actually imposedas the best evidenceof the seriousness of the offense for which Cheff was tried.\" (Emphasis added.) This explanation of the largely unstated reasoning in Cheff became, in an opinion decided the same day as Duncan, the \"rule in Cheff.\" In Bloom v. Illinois, supra at 211, the Court said: \"Under the rule in Cheff, when the legislature has not expressed a judgment as to the seriousness of an offense by fixing a maximum penalty which may be imposed, we are to look to the penalty actually imposedas the best evidenceof the seriousness of the offense. See, ante, p. 503, n. 35.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n16. Duncan v. Louisiana, supra at 161.\n\n17. See, e.g., Cheff v. Schnackenburg, see note 8 supra, which, however, set the maximum at six months not on the basis of constitutional principles, but on the basis of the Court's supervisory powers, and Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., see note 10 supra, which upheld a conviction for criminal contempt, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant was denied trial by jury, where the punishment was limited by statute to ten days' imprisonment plus fine.\n\n18. Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 165, 193 (1958) (dissenting opinion); United States v. Barnett, supra at 724, (dissenting opinion); Cheff v. Schnackenburg, supra at 384 (dissenting opinion); Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., supra at 223 (dissenting opinion).\n\n19. Compare Barnett, supra at 727 (\"[I]f the present defendants committed the acts with which they are charged, their crimes cannot be classified as 'petty,' but are grave indeed.\"), and Cheff, supra at 387 (\"[T]he determination of whether the offense is 'petty' also requires an analysis of the nature of the offense itself; even though short sentences are fixed for a particular offense a jury trial will be constitutionally required if the offense is of a serious character.\"), with Dyke, supra at 223 (\"I am loath to hold whippings or six months' punishment 'as petty.' And here, where the offense is punishable by a $50 fine and 10 days in jail behind bars, I feel the same way. Even though there be some offenses that are 'petty,' I would not hold that this offense falls in that category.\")\n\n20. H.R.S. §729-1 (\"Whoever, after trial by jury, is adjudged guilty of contempt of any court...shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than two years....\").\n\n22. H.R.S. chapter 729.\n\n23. See H.R.S. §729-1, which provides inter alia that one commits contempt \"by publishing animadversions on the evidence or proceedings in a pending trial tending to prejudice the public respecting the same, and to obstruct and prevent the administration of justice; or by knowingly publishing an unfair report of the proceedings of a court, or malicious invectives against a court or jury tending to bring the court or jury, or the administration of justice[,] into ridicule, contempt, discredit or odium....\"\n\n24.
