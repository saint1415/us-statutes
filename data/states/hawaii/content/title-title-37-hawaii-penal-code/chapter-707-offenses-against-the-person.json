A discussion of the definitions in this section, when needed or appropriate, is found in the commentary to the substantive offenses employing the terms defined.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §707-700\n\nWith respect to Item (11), relating to the definition of \"married\", the Proposed Draft had recommended that \"married\" should also include \"a male and female living together as man and wife regardless of their legal status.\" The Code as originally adopted in 1972 did not contain that recommended clause. However, by Act 136, Session Laws 1973, the clause was restored. The legislature declared, \"the definition of 'married' is amended to conform to the language of the proposed Draft of the Hawaii Penal Code as submitted by the Judicial Council of Hawaii and recognizes the prevalence of many male and female couples living together although not legally married.\" House Standing Committee Report No. 726.\n\nAct 223, Session Laws 1980, amended the definitions of \"sexual intercourse\" and \"forcible compulsion\" to make their meanings less restrictive so as to bring more conduct within the scope of sexual offenses. It also deleted the definition of \"female.\" This term was applicable only to the offense of rape, and it became superfluous when the offense was \"de-sexed\" in 1979.\n\nAct 213, Session Laws 1981, sought to clarify the definition of \"forcible compulsion.\" One of the primary changes was to delete the requirement that physical force be such as to \"overcome resistance.\"\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, added the definition of \"substantial bodily injury\" to account for injuries far more serious than bodily injury--which includes any physical pain, illness, or impairment--but do not approximate the risk of death, permanent loss or disfigurement that constitute \"serious bodily injury.\"\n\nAct 314 also added the definition of \"sexual penetration.\" That definition was enacted to express the legislature's intent that even though rape and sodomy are renamed as sexual assault offenses, prosecutors may still charge a defendant with multiple counts for each act of penetration. Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\nAct 181, Session Laws 1987, broadened the definitions of \"sexual contact\" by including touching of the sexual or other intimate parts through the clothing or other material intended to cover the sexual or intimate parts. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1130.\n\nAct 30, Session Laws 2001, amended the definition of \"substantial bodily injury\" by deleting the requirement that qualifying second degree burns be caused by chemical, electrical, friction, or scalding means. The legislature found that the definitions of many crimes include a requirement of \"substantial bodily injury\" and that defining that term too restrictively excludes from successful prosecution many otherwise criminal actions. The legislature supported the categorization of every second degree burn, regardless of origin, as a \"substantial bodily injury.\" The legislature found that burns that are substantial bodily injuries are determined by the severity and degree, not by the nature or cause of the injuries. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 829, House Standing Committee Report No. 1220.\n\nAct 61, Session Laws 2004, amended the definitions of \"sexual contact\" and \"sexual penetration.\" The legislature found that clarification of the definition of \"sexual penetration\" was necessary because of a recent Hawaii supreme court decision, in which the court held that the definition of \"sexual penetration\" required proof of actual penetration for the acts of cunnilingus or anilingus. A previous decision held that the act of cunnilingus is an act of \"sexual penetration\" under the statutory definition of \"sexual penetration,\" irrespective of whether there was proof of actual penetration. The legislature found that it is usually difficult for many sexual assault victims to know whether penetration, however slight, occurred during the act of cunnilingus. Also, the failure to provide such a clarification would reduce many sexual assaults involving acts of cunnilingus or anilingus on children under the age of consent, from a class A felony to a class C felony. The legislature believed that the definition of sexual penetration should include the acts of cunnilingus or anilingus, regardless of whether there was actual penetration. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3121.\n\nAct 116, Session Laws 2006, defined \"emergency worker.\" Act 116 penalized the commission of certain crimes during a time of a civil defense emergency proclaimed by the governor or during a period of disaster relief. The legislature found that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita created situations that highlighted the prevalence of opportunistic crimes that can occur during these times. When resources are needed to restore law and order, emergency response aid to victims may be hampered or delayed, leaving victims at an increased risk of bodily injury or death. Stronger measures to control law and order may deter looting and other crimes. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3302, House Standing Committee Report No. 757-06, Conference Committee Report No. 64-06.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, defined the term \"genital opening\" as used in the definition of \"sexual penetration.\" House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, made a technical nonsubstantive amendment to the definition of \"mentally incapacitated.\"\n\nAct 147, Session Laws 2008, amended this section by defining \"labor\" and \"services.\" Act 147 made it a crime of kidnapping to intentionally or knowingly restrain another person with the intent to unlawfully obtain the labor or services of the person, regardless of whether a debt collection is involved. Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.\n\nAct 21, Session Laws 2012, amended this section by adding the definition of \"vehicle\" for the purpose of modifying the scope of offenses relating to negligent injury to broaden the offenses' application to include injuries caused by more types of vehicles to increase public safety. The legislature found that a person was guilty of a negligent injury offense if that person caused serious or substantial bodily injury to another person while operating a motor vehicle. Act 21 would allow this negligent injury offense to also include the negligent operation of a moped or vessel. Adding a broader definition for vehicles under the Hawaii penal code would hold vehicle operators more accountable for their actions, especially when their actions involve the safety of others. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2449, House Standing Committee Report No. 1101-12.\n\nAct 316, Session Laws 2012, amended this section by adding definitions for \"public highway,\" \"street,\" and \"vulnerable user.\"\n\nAct 111, Session Laws 2014, amended the definition of \"emergency worker.\" Act 111 updated and recodified Hawaii's emergency management laws to conform with nationwide emergency management practices by, among other things, establishing a Hawaii emergency management agency in the state department of defense with the functions and authority currently held by the state civil defense agency; establishing the power and authority of the director of Hawaii emergency management, who will be the adjutant general, and providing the director with the functions and authority currently held by the director of civil defense; establishing county emergency management agencies, each to be under the respective county mayor's direction, with the functions and authority currently held by the local organizations for civil defense; and repealing the chapters on disaster relief [chapter 127] and the civil defense [and] emergency act [chapter 128], which were determined to be obsolete with the creation of the Hawaii emergency management agency. Conference Committee Report No. 129-14.\n\nAct 35, Session Laws 2015, made technical nonsubstantive amendments to the definition of \"vulnerable user.\"\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended the definition of \"sexual contact\" to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 174, Session Laws 2021, amended the definition of \"vulnerable user\" to include a person legally operating an electric foot scooter within a street or public highway. The legislature found that shared micromobility vehicles, including bicycles, e-bikes, and electric foot scooters, were more frequently becoming part of multimodal transportation systems. Although electric foot scooters were becoming increasingly common, they were not adequately regulated under existing law. The legislature further found that electric foot scooters are vehicles but not bicycles and that applying bicycle regulations to electric foot scooters would not be optimal. Accordingly, Act 174 established a framework for the regulation of electric foot scooters by the State and counties. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1612.\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended the definition of \"emergency worker\" to replace the reference to \"public safety officer\" with \"employee of the department of law enforcement conferred with police powers by the director of law enforcement\" to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation. The legislature further found that reorganizing certain state law enforcement functions into a single entity with consistent training opportunities would allow for the efficient use of resources in administering correctional programs and improve decision making, promote accountability, streamline communication, decrease costs, reduce duplication of efforts, provide uniform training and standards, and promote uniform standards of law enforcement services. House Standing Committee Report No. 200-22, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3292.\n\nForcible compulsion construed with respect to 18-month-old victim. 56 H. 664, 548 P.2d 271 (1976).\n\n\"Sexual intercourse\" means coitus or bodily intrusions or penetrations which are malum in se. 66 H. 281, 660 P.2d 522 (1983).\n\n\"Serious bodily injury\": \"serious\" modifies only \"permanent disfigurement\", not \"protracted loss\" phrase. 75 H. 419, 864 P.2d 583 (1993).\n\nDefinition of \"sexual contact\" not unconstitutionally overbroad as it does not interfere with the constitutionally protected activity of nude dancing; section permits dancing in the nude and allows customers to look at performers dancing in the nude; the conduct prohibited is the touching of sexual or intimate parts. 88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227 (1998).\n\nDefinition of \"sexual contact\" not unconstitutionally vague as it establishes a bright line rule \"you can look but you can't touch\", gives a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is prohibited, constitutes an explicit standard that avoids arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and is not subjective. 88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227 (1998).\n\nUnder the plain meaning of §712-1200 and this section, touching the sexual or other intimate parts of another person, for a fee, constitutes prostitution, even if the touching occurs through clothing. 88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227 (1998).\n\nA specific unanimity jury instruction was not required for offense of second degree unlawful imprisonment under §707-722 where defendant's conduct, as proved by the prosecution, constituted a continuing course of conduct \"set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force\", with \"one general intent ... and one continuous plan\". 95 H. 440, 24 P.3d 32 (2001).\n\nAs a precondition to convicting a person of first degree sexual assault, in violation of §707-730(1)(b), the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person committed an act of \"any penetration, however slight\", as mandated by the plain language of the definition of \"sexual penetration\" contained in this section. 102 H. 391, 76 P.3d 943 (2003).\n\nBased on the plain language and legislative history of this section and construing the definition of \"sexual contact\" with reference to other definitions relating to sexual relations in this section and §712-1210, contact with the interior of the mouth constitutes \"touching of intimate parts\" under the definition of \"sexual contact\" in this section. 108 H. 279, 118 P.3d 1222 (2005).\n\nAccording to the plain language of the Hawaii penal code, a fetus is not included within the definition of the term \"person\". 109 H. 115, 123 P.3d 1210 (2005).\n\nWhere the definition of \"sexual conduct\" under §712-1210 includes \"physical contact with a person's clothed or unclothed ... buttocks ... for the purposes of sexual stimulation, gratification, or perversion\", an in pari materia reading of §712-1210 as well as the legislative history of this section supports the conclusion that the legislature intended the buttocks to be an \"intimate part\" for purposes of \"sexual contact\" as that phrase is defined in this section. 125 H. 1, 249 P.3d 1141 (2011).\n\nThere was overwhelming and compelling evidence tending to show defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of kidnapping, where defendant restrained victim intentionally or knowingly, with intent to inflict bodily injury upon victim or subject victim to a sexual offense or terrorize victim, by, inter alia, striking victim in the face and back of the head several times specifically in response to victim's request to let victim go and victim's attempts to escape. 126 H. 267, 270 P.3d 997 (2011).\n\nThere was overwhelming and compelling evidence tending to show defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of two counts of sexual assault in the third degree, where defendant subjected victim to sexual contact by placing defendant's hand and mouth on victim's breast, respectively, by strong compulsion, and did so knowingly as to each element of the offense. 126 H. 267, 270 P.3d 997 (2011).\n\nThere was overwhelming evidence tending to show defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of two counts of sexual assault in the first degree, where defendant subjected victim to acts of sexual penetration by inserting defendant's penis into victim's mouth and genital openings, respectively, by strong compulsion, and did so knowingly as to each element of the offense. 126 H. 267, 270 P.3d 997 (2011).\n\n\"Bodily injury\". 2 H. App. 19, 624 P.2d 1374 (1981).\n\n\"Mentally incapacitated\"; consent vitiated by deception; based on the record, victim was \"physically helpless\". 5 H. App. 404, 696 P.2d 846 (1985).\n\n\"Mentally defective\". 5 H. App. 659, 706 P.2d 1333 (1985).\n\nWhen jury can infer handgun is dangerous. 5 H. App. 674, 706 P.2d 453 (1985).\n\nEvidence of injuries sustained by victim struck in face with golf club, including broken facial and jaw bones, was sufficient to prove serious bodily injury. 8 H. App. 595, 817 P.2d 123 (1991).\n\nIn the terroristic threatening context, an instrument is a dangerous instrument, as defined in this section, when it is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury when used in the manner it is threatened to be used. 10 H. App. 584, 880 P.2d 213 (1994).\n\nWitness' testimony that witness was \"sore\" after being struck by appellant was sufficient to establish \"physical pain\" and thus, the element of \"bodily injury\" in assault charge. 79 H. 265 (App.), 900 P.2d 1332 (1995).\n\nSection imposes requirement that laceration must be \"major\" in order to fall within definition of \"substantial bodily injury\". 82 H. 373 (App.), 922 P.2d 986 (1996).\n\nThere was substantial evidence that minor caused serious bodily injury to complainant as defined in this section where minor inflicted bodily injury which caused protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ--namely, the eye injury that caused the blurred and diplopic vision that was still bothering complainant at the time of trial. 106 H. 530 (App.), 107 P.3d 1203 (2005).\n\nWhere defendant punched and kicked another so ferociously in the face that the lip was split clean through, four teeth were bashed in, the eye was hemorrhaged and pushed inward, and the orbital floor was fractured causing blurred and diplopic vision lasting almost eleven months, there was substantial evidence that the defendant was, at the very least, aware that it was practically certain that defendant's conduct would cause the result required, \"serious bodily injury\", for conviction of first degree assault. 106 H. 530 (App.), 107 P.3d 1203 (2005).\n\nWhere there was substantial evidence that the manner in which the \"little black stick\" was used was capable of producing serious bodily injury as defined under this section, minor was properly convicted as an accomplice to robbery in the first degree under §708-840. 107 H. 439 (App.), 114 P.3d 945 (2005).\n\nAlthough the evidence was insufficient to show that defendant committed the offense of first degree assault, there was ample evidence to show that the victim's injury satisfied the definition of \"substantial bodily injury\" under this section and that defendant thus committed the lesser included offense of second degree assault in violation of §707-711(1)(a); thus the jury, having returned a guilty verdict against defendant for first degree assault, must also have found sufficient evidence to prove the lesser included offense of second degree assault. 116 H. 445 (App.), 173 P.3d 592 (2007).\n\nA stabbing injury that is caused by a knife blade that penetrates close to vital internal organs and vessels but misses without harming them, so that the injury quickly resolves itself without the need for significant treatment, does not create a substantial risk of death within the meaning of this section. 116 H. 445 (App.), 173 P.3d 592 (2007).",

The actor in such a crime has disregarded the most highly held social values, and has proved oneself an extreme danger to society. The Code recognizes the highly aggravated nature of this crime in imposing its most severe sanction.\n\nSeveral states, and some recent efforts at penal law revision, recognize two degrees of murder.[1] One of the primary reasons for this distinction is to limit the scope of first degree murder in jurisdictions which make it a capital offense.[2] In states, like Hawaii, where the death penalty has been abolished, the above reason for the distinction is no longer applicable and the continuation of the distinction would be a carryover from the older death penalty legislation.\n\nUnder previous Hawaii law, first degree murder required proof of \"deliberate premeditated malice aforethought.\"[3] For a conviction of murder in the second degree, the Hawaii law required only \"malice aforethought.\"[4] The Code is in accord with the Model Penal Code in making murder a unified offense which requires that the actor act intentionally or knowingly with respect to the homicidal result.[5] If a person has the conscious object of causing the death of another, or if the person is \"practically certain\" that the person will cause the death, the person has the requisite culpability for conviction.\n\nMurder has usually been defined to provide that it can be committed by extreme recklessness. In recent codes which do recognize two degrees of murder, a homicide caused with this lesser degree of mental culpability has been made murder in the second degree.[6] The net effect is to change manslaughter to murder when aggravated circumstances are present. Typically, these formulations hold an individual guilty of murder in the second degree if\n\n[h]e recklessly causes the death of another person under circumstances which manifest a cruel, wicked, and depraved indifference to human life.[7]\n\nAnalytically, however, it is both simpler and more appropriate to leave provisions for more severe sentences in aggravated circumstances to those sections which are specifically designed to deal with such cases. An actor whose indifference to human life amounts to \"practical certainty\" of causing death will be held to have caused death knowingly under the Code's formulation of murder; but where the actor's conduct is characterized by a \"cruel, wicked, and depraved indifference,\" without more, these character traits ought to be taken into account at the time of disposition. Sections 706-661 and 706-662 provide for extended sentences in such aggravated circumstances. An individual who would, under a statute such as that quoted above, be convicted of second degree murder would, under the Code's system, be convicted of manslaughter and given an extended sentence. The resultant sentence may be the same in both cases;[8] however, where the other formulation requires the determination of the actor's character to be made by the finder of fact, the Code assigns this task to a psychiatrist, who is eminently better suited to make such determinations. More specifically, the psychiatrist must report that the actor's conduct is characterized by \"compulsive, aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to consequences, and that such condition makes him a serious danger to others.\"[9] It is easily seen that the psychiatrist is looking for precisely those traits which the trier of fact is asked to find in the other form of the statute. And, beyond the psychiatrist's greater expertise in making such determinations, the abnormality presented by such character traits falls more appropriately under special circumstances requiring prolonged treatment, via an extended sentence, than under greater moral culpability requiring conviction for a more serious offense.\n\nFelony-murder rule.The felony-murder rule[10] \"has an extensive history of thoughtful condemnation.\"[11] The genesis of the rule may have been due to an erroneous interpretation by Coke of a passage from Bracton and, at least since 1834, when His Majesty's Commissioners on Criminal Law found the rule to be \"totally incongruous with the general principles of our jurisprudence,\"[12] the rule has been condemned by writers and scholars.\n\nThe felony-murder rule has been used to support murder convictions of defendants where one victim of a robbery accidentally shoots another victim,[13] where one of the defendant's co-robbers kills another co-robber during a robbery for the latter's refusal to obey orders and not as part of the robbery transaction,[14] and where the defendant (a dope addict) commits robbery of the defendant's homicide victim as an afterthought following the killing.[15] The application of the felony-murder rule dispenses with the need to prove that culpability with respect to the homicidal result that is otherwise required to support a conviction for murder and therefore leads to anomalous results. The rule has been called a \"legal Hydra.\"[16] \"Like the multiheaded beast of Greek mythology, the felony-murder rule has several 'heads' of its own, each willing to consume one of the accused's defenses by presuming a needed element in the proof of felony murder.\"[17]\n\nBecause \"principled argument in its [the felony-murder rule's] defense is hard to find,\"[18] the Model Penal Code,[19] certain recent penal revisions,[20] and some recent cases[21] have limited the scope of the rule. The attempts to preserve the rule by limiting its application have taken a number of forms. Some recent revisions require that the death be recklessly caused in furtherance of a felony or attempted felony,[22] others require that the death be caused simply in furtherance of the felony and allow the defendant an affirmative defense if the defendant can show, in effect, that the defendant reasonably did not foresee the possibility of the killing.[23] That the killing may result from acts done negligently or recklessly (states of mind otherwise insufficient to establish murder) is not changed. California has limited the application of the rule by a re-interpretation of existing statutory language.[24] The court limited the rule in terms of persons: it held that a killing by a victim of the attempted felony of defendant's co-felon was not \"to perpetrate\" the felony and that the felony-murder rule was not applicable to the surviving defendant. In view of the statutory language making the rule applicable to killings in the perpetration of an enumerated felony, the language and logic of the court are somewhat strained.[25] However, the court's attempt to limit the rule and thereby avoid the questionable results brought about by the rule's broad application has been characterized as a \"heightened awareness of the doctrine's underlying illogic.\"[26] The Model Penal Code has taken a different approach: it has abandoned the felony-murder rule as a rule of substantive law and has reformulated it as a rule of evidence. Extreme recklessness, which under the M.P.C. is sufficient to establish murder, may be presumed from the commission of certain enumerated felonies.[27]\n\nThe wiser course, it seems, would be to follow the lead of England[28] and India[29] and abolish the felony-murder rule in its entirety. The rule certainly is not an indispensable ingredient in a system of criminal injustice; \"[t]he rule is unknown as such in continental Europe.\"[30]\n\nEven in its limited formulation the felony-murder rule is still objectionable. It is not sound principle to convert an accidental, negligent, or reckless homicide into a murder simply because, without more, the killing was in furtherance of a criminal objective of some defined class. Engaging in certain penally-prohibited behavior may, of course, evidence a recklessness sufficient to establish manslaughter, or a practical certainty or intent, with respect to causing death, sufficient to establish murder, but such a finding is an independent determination which must rest on the facts of each case. Limited empirical data discloses that the ratio of homicides in the course of specific felonies[31] to the total number of those felonies does not justify a presumption of culpability with respect to the homicide result sufficient to establish murder.[32] There appears to be no logical base for the felony-murder rule which presumes, either conclusively or subject to rebuttal, culpability sufficient to establish murder.[33]\n\nNor does the felony-murder rule serve a legitimate deterrent function. The actor has already disregarded the presumably sufficient penalties imposed for the underlying felony. If the murder penalty is to be used to reinforce the deterrent effect of penalties imposed for certain felonies (by converting an accidental, negligent, or reckless killing into a murder), it would be more effective, and hardly more fortuitous, to select a certain ratio of convicted felons for the murder penalty by lot.[34]\n\nIn recognition of the trend toward, and the substantial body of criticism supporting, the abolition of the felony-murder rule, and because of the extremely questionable results which the rule has worked in other jurisdictions, the Code has eliminated from our law the felony-murder rule.\n\nGeneral effect of Code.The homicide sections of the Code substantially simplify and clarify the law of Hawaii, although the results reached by the court or jury in most cases will probably be similar. As explained above, the felony-murder rule has been eliminated.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law provided that a person convicted of murder in the first degree shall be imprisoned at hard labor for life not subject to parole.[35] A person convicted of murder in the second degree, under previous law, would be sentenced to \"imprisonment at hard labor for any number of years but for a term not less than twenty years.\"[36] Under the Code, a convicted defendant will be sentenced to imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the maximum length of which will be life imprisonment without parole in four instances set forth in §706-606(a) or life or twenty years as determined by the court.[37] The possibility of eventual parole is made available by the general revision of sentencing in chapter 706.\n\nThe need for clarification of the law has been implied rather strongly by the Supreme Court of Hawaii. For instance, the court has stated plainly, on a number of occasions, that it is reversible error, in some murder trials, to instruct the jury in the language of the previous statutory presumption on \"malice aforethought.\"[38] Moreover, although the court said that \"malice aforethought\" was the same as \"malice,\"[39] it was not the same \"malice\" as that which was defined in the prior penal code,[40] and it was apparently reversible error in any homicide prosecution to instruct the jury in the language of the statutory definition.[41] Furthermore, the antiquity and ambiguity of, and the difficulty in dealing with, the requirement of \"malice aforethought\" is evident from a cursory glance at court opinions.[42] This Code eliminates such problems of interpretation, while achieving greater simplicity and consistency.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §707-701\n\nThe legislature, in adopting the Code in 1972, added the provision for mandatory life imprisonment without parole (but subject to commutation) as contained in §706-606(a). The legislature stated that these instances \"are so threatening to the security of our society that the severest deterrent penalty should be required.\" Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972). The reader is referred to the discussion in the Supplemental Commentary on §706-606.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) to clarify that the killing of a person known by the defendant to be a witness in a criminal prosecution is murder in the first degree [if the killing is related to the person's status as a witness]. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 63, Session Laws 2011, amended this section by establishing first degree murder for a person who causes death to a person: (1) from whom the defendant has been restrained, by order of any court, from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing pursuant to domestic abuse protective orders; (2) who is being protected by a police officer ordering the defendant to leave the premises of the protected person, during the effective period of the order; or (3) who is known by the defendant to be a witness in a family court proceeding and the killing is related to the person's status as a witness. The legislature found that domestic violence victims need added protection under Hawaii law. Restraining orders or orders from police officers to abusers to leave the premises are intended to remove abusers from the vicinity of domestic violence victims and provide safety. The legislature believed that domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable when they attempt to disengage from their abusers and at that time, violence and the threat of violence are at the most extreme levels. Increasing the penalties against abusers in those situations may deter violent retaliation and may help break victims from the cycle of violence. House Standing Committee Report No. 930, Conference Committee Report No. 74, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1255.\n\nAct 214, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to broaden the offense of murder in the first degree to include cases in which the victim was restrained as a shield, hostage, or for ransom or reward. The legislature found that the offense of murder in the first degree was a narrowly defined offense that was limited to cases in which there were multiple victims, the victim was killed by a hired killer, or the victim was under the specific protection of or had a particular role with the courts or law enforcement system. Defendants convicted of murder in the first degree are automatically sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. All other forms of murder are covered under the offense of murder in the second degree, and defendants convicted of murder in the second degree are generally sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. However, it is possible for a defendant convicted of murder in the second degree to be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if enhanced sentencing under §706-657 or an extended term of imprisonment under §706-661 is applied. The legislature found that the different sentencing requirements between these two offenses can have a tremendous impact on the surviving members of the victims' families.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1987, c 181, §8; am L 1996, c 197, §2; am L 2003, c 64, §1; am L 2006, c 230, §28; am L 2018, c 2, §7; am L 2019, c 149, §1]\n\nCross References\n\nRecklessness with respect to result of conduct, see §702-206.\n\nCOMMENTARY ON §707-702\n\nManslaughter is traditionally considered as an offense less heinous than murder, principally because the actor's state of mind is less culpable. The Code has followed the lead of other recent criminal law revisions in making recklessness the standard of culpability for this offense.[1] The Code is also in accord with other revisions with regard to the sentence.[2]\n\nThe reduction of murder to manslaughter, when mitigating mental or emotional disturbances are present, appears in the Model Penal Code and most recent state revisions.[3] This reduction is a clarification of the common law on the subject.[4] The Code adopts this approach in subsection (2).\n\nIn the case of an intentional or knowing killing, where mitigating circumstances are present, the prosecutor may, but need not, bring a prosecution for murder. The prosecutor may, if the prosecutor chooses, bring a prosecution for manslaughter. Since recklessness will be satisfied by proof that the defendant acted intentionally or knowingly,[5] a charge of manslaughter could be employed where a prosecutor, in the prosecutor's discretion, did not wish to push for a murder conviction.\n\nIntentionally causing another to commit suicide is designated manslaughter. While other codes have treated this as a separate offense,[6] the Code incorporates conduct causing this result into the definition of manslaughter. The harm sought to be prevented is largely the same, and, although the conduct is intentional, rather than reckless, the dependence of the result on the will of another justifies requiring a higher standard of culpability than that which is required in cases of \"direct\" causation.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law defined manslaughter as any killing \"without malice aforethought, and without authority, justification, or extenuation.\"[7] The Code clarifies substantially the statutory requirements for a conviction of manslaughter.\n\nThe case law of Hawaii contains the typical common-law provision for the reduction of murder in the first or second degree to manslaughter when mitigating mental or emotional disturbances are present. Reduction of the offense for killing in the \"heat of passion\" has been recognized[8] and something approximating the Code's more general approach to mental and emotional extenuation had been accepted as early as 1853:\n\nWhoever kills another... under the sudden impulse of passion... of a nature tending to disturb the judgment and mental faculties, and weaken the possession of self-control of the killing party, is not guilty of murder, but manslaughter.[9]\n\nThe criterion of a general weakening of self-control was quite an advanced and liberal approach for 1853. However, there were the additional requirements that the killing be without malice and that the passion be provoked or caused by the victim.10 Such additional requirements tended to subvert the otherwise liberal approach.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §707-702\n\nAct 181, Session Laws 1987, added language to this section to reflect the recently created statutory murder crimes. These crimes are murder in the first and second degree. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1130.\n\nAct 197, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by raising the crime of manslaughter from a class B to a class A felony. The legislature found that homicides, particularly homicides involving domestic violence situations, have increased in the State. A person convicted of manslaughter as a class B felony may be sentenced to imprisonment for a maximum of ten years. The legislature believed that a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment was inadequate for the taking of a life. Conference Committee Report No. 71.\n\nAct 64, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by establishing extreme mental or emotional disturbance as an affirmative defense to murder or attempted murder. Under existing law, a defendant charged with murder or attempted murder need not raise extreme mental or emotional disturbance as a defense, and may not legitimately have extreme mental or emotional disturbance, but the prosecution must still disprove that the defendant suffers from extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Establishing extreme mental or emotional disturbance as an affirmative defense requires the defense to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant suffers from extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Conference Committee Report No. 56.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended subsection (1) by making technical nonsubstantive amendments.\n\nAct 2, Session Laws 2018, amended this section to provide that the offense of manslaughter does not apply to actions taken pursuant to chapter 327L, which allows an adult resident of the State with a medically confirmed terminal disease and less than six months to live to obtain a prescription for medication to end the person's life. The amendment was included among several immunities established for persons or organizations acting in good faith compliance with chapter 327L, including physicians, their associates, and the facilities or institutions where they provide services. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3251.\n\nAct 149, Session Laws 2019, amended this section to: (1) amend the affirmative defense of extreme mental or emotional disturbance to murder or attempted murder by prohibiting explanations based solely on the discovery, knowledge, or disclosure of the victim's gender, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation; and (2) require the court to instruct the jury to disregard bias and prejudice if a defendant's explanation includes the discovery, knowledge, or disclosure of the victim's gender, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation. The legislature found that \"gay panic\" or \"transgender panic\" defenses are uniquely used to justify crime against individuals of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or other genders or sexualities and are based on exploiting homophobic bias in factfinders. The legislature further found that bans on these types of defenses have been implemented in California, Illinois, and Rhode Island. The legislature additionally found that homicide or assault of a person because of that person's sexual orientation or gender identity should not be a criminal defense.

Like the previous Hawaii law, negligent homicide under the Code is divided into two degrees. As in prior law, the Code restricts the offense to cases involving the operation of a \"vehicle.\" However, under prior law negligent homicide in the first degree was committed where a person by the operation of any vehicle in a \"grossly negligent\" manner caused the death of another. HRS §748-9. Under the Code, §707-703(1), a person is guilty of negligent homicide in the first degree if the person causes the death of another person by the operation of a vehicle in a \"negligent\" manner. The statutorily defined standard of \"negligence\" upon which this offense is based is set forth in §702-206(4). The actor should be aware of a \"substantial and unjustifiable risk\" with respect to the actor's conduct, the attendant circumstances, and the result of the actor's conduct. The actor's failure to perceive the risk must constitute a \"gross deviation\" from the standard of care that a law-abiding person would observe in the same situation. (See §702-206(4).) The offense is a class C felony.\n\nThe prior law made it negligent homicide in the second degree in the case where a person, by the operation of a vehicle in a \"negligent\" manner, caused the death of another. HRS §749-9(b). Section 707-704(1) of the Code provides that a person is guilty of negligent homicide in the second degree if the person causes the death of another person by the operation of a vehicle \"in a manner which is simple negligence.\" Negligent homicide in the second degree is a misdemeanor. Under §707-704(2), a person acts with \"simple negligence\" when the person should be aware of a \"risk\" (not \"substantial and unjustifiable risk\", as stated in §702-206(4)) with respect to the person's conduct, the attendant circumstances, and the result of the person's conduct. The person's failure to perceive the risk must constitute a \"deviation\" (not \"gross deviation\", as stated in §702-206(4)) from the standard of care that a law-abiding person would observe in the same situation.\n\nThe Code as adopted differs in several respects from the recommendation of the Proposed Draft with respect to negligent homicide. The Proposed Draft provided that a person is guilty of negligent homicide if \"he negligently causes the death of another person.\" It constituted the crime as a misdemeanor. Under the Proposed Draft, the offense had only one degree and it was not restricted to the operation of a vehicle. Also, the draft did not recognize as a basis for culpability the standard of \"simple negligence\" set forth in the Code's second degree negligent homicide.\n\nIn Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972), it is stated:\n\nYour Committee has agreed to the creation of two degrees of negligent homicide in order to preserve the present law distinction between gross negligence and simple negligence. Your Committee finds that expansion of the offense of negligent homicide beyond the scope of the operation of a motor vehicle is not necessary at the present time.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §707-703 AND 707-704\n\nAct 292, Session Laws 1988, amended these sections by making negligent homicide in the second degree a class C felony and negligent homicide in the third degree a misdemeanor. The legislature felt that stronger measures were needed to protect the public and to deter those who negligently operate a motor vehicle, which results in bodily injury or death to others.

Hawaii's roadways have often been called dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists, and others who legally use the public right of way without being in a vehicle. Unfortunately, when collisions occur between vehicles and these individuals, the outcome is often catastrophic. Amending the offense of negligent injury in the first degree to include a provision for incidents in which vulnerable highway users are involved may, at the very least, increase driver awareness of these individuals.

Accordingly, assault in the first degree is made a class B felony, one class below murder.\n\nAssault in the second degree, as defined in §707-711, embodies two types of behavior-and-result. (1) When a person acts intentionally or knowingly, with a dangerous instrument, the definition of the offense does not require the bodily injury inflicted to be serious, as in the first degree. However, the offense is still a felony, albeit one class lower. Assault offenses are intended to penalize injurious conduct to the bodily integrity of the person. The danger represented by the use of a dangerous instrument is largely inchoate in nature, and, although constituting an aggravating circumstance, the danger is not of the same order as the actual infliction of serious bodily injury. Hence, the offense is a class C felony. (2) When a person acts recklessly the person's state of mind is far less culpable than the intentional or knowing actor; however, the employment of a dangerous instrument and the infliction of serious harm present dangers which, in total, require treatment as a class C felony.\n\nAssault in the third degree, as defined in §707-712, is treated as a misdemeanor. In subsection (1)(a), where a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, the less serious nature of the injury, together with the absence of aggravating circumstances, warrant the less severe penalty. In subsection (1)(b), negligent culpability will suffice where the aggravating circumstance of a dangerous instrument is present. Assault in the third degree is reduced to a petty misdemeanor if the harm is inflicted in a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent.\n\nThe Code's gradation of assaults follows generally the Model Penal Code.[3] Previous Hawaii law defined assault in terms of attempt to injure another.[4] Also included was the placing of another in apprehension of being injured.[5] The Code handles this latter case in the sections on Reckless Endangering ( § §707-713 and 714) and Terroristic Threatening ( §707-715). After the definition of the basic offense of assault, the Hawaii Revised Statutes listed three classes of aggravating circumstances, calling for either felony or misdemeanor sanctions, depending upon the severity of the aggravation.[6] The unaggravated offense was slightly more severe than, but roughly equivalent to, a petty misdemeanor.[7] Consensual scuffles were included in the unaggravated offense.[8] Hence the Code is similar in both structure and penalty to prior Hawaii law, but achieves greater economy and clarity of statement.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §707-710 TO 707-712\n\nAct 84, Session Laws 1979, added subsection (c) to §707-711 as a means of deterring a rising number of assaults committed against correctional officers. The legislature found that due to the very nature of a corrections facility, a high probability existed that correctional workers who were not on duty might be assaulted within the facility. Conference Committee Report No. 14.\n\nAct 257, Session Laws 1987, amended §707-711 to give educational workers added protection by making it a crime to assault them. Senate Conference Committee Report No. 24, House Conference Committee Report No. 20.\n\nAct 279, Session Laws 1988, amended §707-711 to clarify that second degree assault does not include persons injuring themselves. House Standing Committee Report No. 1598-88.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §707-711(1) by adding, as an element of the offense of assault in the second degree, the reckless causing of substantial bodily injury to another person.\n\nAct 298, Session Laws 2006, amended §707-711 by including an employee of a charter school in the definition of \"educational worker.\"\n\nAct 9, Session Laws 2007, amended §707-711(1)(e) by deleting the brackets around the word \"or\" to ratify the revisor's insertion of \"or,\" which was done to blend the amendments by Acts 230 and 298, Session Laws 2006, to the definition of \"educational worker.\" House Standing Committee Report No. 807.\n\nAct 79, Session Laws 2007, amended §707-711(1) by establishing a criminal offense of assault in the second degree if a person intentionally [or] knowingly causes bodily injury to any emergency medical services personnel who is engaged in the performance of duty. The legislature found that emergency medical services personnel are at a heightened risk of personal injury or death from patients and others with whom they are in contact in the course of their work. By the very nature of the job, emergency medical services personnel respond to people in distressful situations, which include incidences of criminal violence, family disputes, and drunken brawls. Although the legislature acknowledged that much of the violence promulgated from explosive situations involving agitated people who lack momentary self-control, the legislature believed that emergency medical [services] personnel should be afforded the same protection as correctional workers and educational workers. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1244.\n\nAct 100, Session Laws 2008, amended §707-711(1) by making an assault on a person employed at a state-operated or -contracted mental health facility assault in the second degree, a class C felony. The legislature found that mental health professionals need to be protected from criminal behavior that, at times, occurs during the course of performing their job duties. Act 100 imposed the same penalty on a defendant that knowingly or intentionally assaults a staff member at the Hawaii state hospital as that imposed for assaults that occur in a school or correctional facility. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2331, Conference Committee Report No. 37-08.\n\nAct 146, Session Laws 2010, amended §707-711(1) by expanding the class of emergency services providers protected against assault to include, among others, physicians, physician's assistants, nurses, and nurse practitioners providing medical services in a hospital emergency room. The legislature found that emergency medical workers serve an indispensable public need but face a high level of risk in the line of duty. Nationally, studies show that between thirty-five per cent and eighty per cent of hospital staff have been physically assaulted at least once and that nurses are at an increased risk for violence while on duty. The legislature found that extending the offense of assault in the second degree to include actions against emergency services providers in emergency rooms is a logical extension of the existing provisions covering emergency response personnel. Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 2989 and 2765, House Standing Committee Report No. 466-10, Conference Committee Report No. 33-10.\n\nAct 63, Session Laws 2011, amended §707-711(1) by establishing second degree assault for a person who causes bodily injury to a person: (1) from whom the defendant has been restrained, by order of any court, from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing pursuant to domestic abuse protective orders; or (2) who is being protected by a police officer ordering the defendant to leave the premises of the protected person, during the effective period of the order. The legislature found that domestic violence victims need added protection under Hawaii law. Restraining orders or orders from police officers to abusers to leave the premises are intended to remove abusers from the vicinity of domestic violence victims and provide safety. The legislature believed that domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable when they attempt to disengage from their abusers and at that time, violence and the threat of violence are at the most extreme levels. Increasing the penalties against abusers in those situations may deter violent retaliation and may help break victims from the cycle of violence. House Standing Committee Report No. 930, Conference Committee Report No. 74, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1255.\n\nAct 187, Session Laws 2011, amended §707-711(1) by adding to the offense of assault in the second degree intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to a firefighter or water safety officer who is engaged in the performance of duty. Firefighters and water safety officers, like correctional workers, educational workers, and emergency medical services providers, may find themselves in hostile and volatile situations, stemming from drug use by or domestic violence between members of the public. The volatile situations can erupt and place a firefighter or water safety officer in danger trying to perform public safety functions. Conference Committee Report No. 32.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended §707-711(1) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 147, Session Laws 2018, amended §707-711 to provide that the felony offense of assault in the second degree includes intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to a person who is engaged in the performance of duty at a health care facility; engaged in providing home health care services; or employed or contracted to work by a mutual benefit society to provide case management services to an individual in a hospital, health care provider's office, or home. The legislature found that violence against health care personnel appears to be on the rise. According to the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics, health care workers experience violent assaults at a rate four times higher than the national average. Under section 707-711, there are additional penalties for a defendant who intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to certain classes of workers, such as educational workers, employees of state-operated or state-contracted mental health facilities, firefighters, and emergency medical services providers. Although some health care workers fall within the category of emergency medical services providers, many do not. The legislature found that Act 147 would extend additional penalties to cover violence against all health care workers. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3554.\n\nAct 147, Session Laws 2021, amended §707-710 to provide that the offense of assault in the first degree includes intentionally or knowingly causing substantial bodily injury to a person who is sixty years of age or older where the age of the injured person is known or reasonably should be known to the person causing the injury. Act 147 also amended §707-711 to provide that the offense of assault in the second degree includes intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to a person who is sixty years of age or older where the age of the injured person is known or reasonably should be known to the person causing the injury. The legislature found that the rate of crimes targeting seniors in the State had increased in recent years. The legislature further found that senior citizens are especially vulnerable to long-term physical, emotional, and financial harm from criminal acts and that there was a lack of adequate protection against exploitation of senior citizens under existing law. Act 147 more closely aligned certain Penal Code statutes with common elder abuse scenarios to facilitate appropriate responses by law enforcement and prosecutors. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1212.\n\nAct 140, Session Laws 2023, amended §707-711 to make intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to a sports official a class C felony. The legislature found that Act 140 would afford protection within the justice system for threats and bodily harm to sports officials when spectators and fans are uncontrollable and allow for athletes to continue to have a positive athletic experience. The legislature further found that there was a shortage of sports officials and, although there were several factors responsible for this shortage, harassment by unruly spectators and fans was a major contributing factor, especially when threats to cause bodily harm and other more serious assaultive conduct are made.

The legislature noted that this measure may not have any deterrent effect because assaults on police officers usually happen in the heat of the moment. House Standing Committee Report No. 1203-90.\n\nAct 66, Session Laws 2003, amended this section to upgrade assault against a police officer to a class C felony and expand its scope to cover other law enforcement officers. Under current law, threatening a police officer is a felony, although actual assault of a police officer is a misdemeanor. It is a class C felony to assault correctional workers or educational workers who are engaged in the performance of their duties. The legislative intent was to deter the rising number of assaults committed against correctional officers each year, and to give educational workers added protection. The legislature believed that law enforcement officers deserved the same protection and deterrent methods as these other workers. The legislature expressed the intent that the term \"law enforcement officer\" includes, but is not limited to, police officers, sheriffs, sheriff deputies, department of land and natural resources enforcement officers, and investigators with the department of the attorney general.

The legislature found that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita created situations that highlighted the prevalence of opportunistic crimes that can occur during these times.

The Code obviates the need for special legislation on each dangerous instrument or act. Rather, all conduct so endangering human life or limb is made a misdemeanor.\n\nThe aggravated offense of reckless endangering in the first degree, §707-713, is reserved for cases where the actor employs \"widely dangerous means.\" Widely dangerous means, as defined in §708-800, are those means which are known to be capable of causing widespread damage or destruction to both life and property. It is thought that where the potential for destruction is this great, the actor's dangerousness to society is increased so substantially, over the case where only a single or a few people are threatened, that the felony sanction is justified.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §707-713 AND 707-714\n\nAct 215, Session Laws 1978, added to §707-713(1) the words \"or intentionally fires a firearm in a manner which places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.\" The legislature felt that the grave dangers posed by the use of a firearm justified a felony sanction. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 675-78, House Standing Committee Report No. 116.\n\nAct 285, Session Laws 1988, amended §707-713 for the purpose of limiting the offense, in regard to firearms, to a person who intentionally fires a firearm in a manner which recklessly places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury. House Standing Committee Report No. 1604-88, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2141.\n\nAct 62, Session Laws 1990, amended §707-714 to subject to misdemeanor liability, a person who creates an obvious risk to the public by intentionally discharging a firearm in areas likely to be traveled or inhabited.

Further, the United States Secret Service and the United States Department of Education reported that in 68 per cent of deadly school shootings, the attacker obtained the firearm from the attacker's home or that of a relative. In addition, over 75 per cent of firearms used in suicide attempts and unintentional firearm injuries among children and adolescents were stored in the residence of the victim, a relative, or a friend.

In the first instance, it is an offense against the individual of substantial magnitude and danger, even allowing for the lack of any actual harm. This danger is recognized for two reasons. (1) It is easily seen that people who are attempting to avoid what they believe to be a serious harm may often take action so precipitous as to harm themselves. Where the actual harm occurs, the threatener may be guilty of a more serious offense. But where the harm does not occur, this section permits conviction for the inchoate threat. (2) The civil law has come to recognize the validity of psychological trauma; recovery may now be had for the intentional infliction of such injury even though the conduct of the offender had no physical connection with the victim. If such conduct constitutes a recognized substantial danger, it follows that a penal sanction may appropriately be imposed for conduct which intentionally or recklessly creates the danger.\n\nIn the second instance, the magnitude of the inconvenience and attendant dangers involved in the disruption of public services and activities warrant the imposition of the penal sanction.1\n\nIn both cases, because threats represent far less of a danger than does consummation of the criminal objective, the offense is only graded as a misdemeanor. The sanction is more commensurate with the inconvenience of personal apprehension of danger, or of public disruption, than with the possibility of the threatened evil being accomplished. In the latter case, of the accomplished evil, the various attempt and substantive sections will deal more severely with the conduct and results involved.\n\nPrevious Hawaii law contained no prohibition of the conduct proscribed by this section.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §707-715\n\nWhen the legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it departed from §715 of the Proposed Code by deleting the phrase \"serious public inconvenience\" as a basis of criminal liability and by deleting the word \"public\" preceding the word \"building.\"\n\nAs stated in Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972):\n\nYour Committee has agreed to delete the phrase \"serious public inconvenience\" as a basis of criminal liability for terroristic threatening because of its possible unconstitutional vagueness. Your Committee has also agreed to have this statute apply to private as well as public buildings by deletion of the word \"public.\"\n\nAct 184, Session Laws 1979, broadened this section to include threats to commit a felony.\n\nAct 214, Session Laws 2012, amended this section by including pets and livestock as property that, if threatened to be damaged or harmed, may constitute the offense of terroristic threatening. The legislature found that Act 214 clarified that threatening to cause serious damage to the property of another person includes threatening to damage or harm the pets and livestock of that person under the terroristic threatening offense. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2451, Conference Committee Report No. 22-12.\n\nDefendant's constitutional right to unanimous verdict not violated as section defines a single criminal offense; paragraphs (1) and (2) constitute alternative means of establishing the mens rea of the offense of terroristic threatening--either one giving rise to the same criminal culpability. 92 H. 577, 994 P.2d 509 (2000).\n\nA specific unanimity jury instruction was not required where defendant's conduct, as alleged and proved by the prosecution, constituted a continuing course of conduct \"set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force\", with \"one general intent ... and one continuous plan\". 95 H. 440, 24 P.3d 32 (2001).\n\nDefendant's first degree terroristic threatening conviction remanded for new trial where instructions did not sufficiently inform jury that, to constitute a \"true threat\", defendant's threatening utterance was objectively susceptible to inducing fear of bodily injury in a reasonable person at whom the threat was directed and who was familiar with the circumstances under which the threat was uttered. 95 H. 465, 24 P.3d 661 (2001).\n\nDefendant's first degree terroristic threatening conviction remanded for new trial where trial court failed to instruct jury that it could consider relevant attributes of both defendant and the subject of the allegedly threatening utterance in determining whether the subject's fear of bodily injury, as allegedly induced by defendant's threatening utterance, was objectively reasonable under the circumstances in which the threat was uttered. 95 H. 465, 24 P.3d 661 (2001).\n\nNeither the free speech clause of the U.S. Constitution nor that of the Hawaii constitution impose a temporal \"immediacy\" requirement that must be met before words become subject to criminal prosecution as \"true threats\". 95 H. 465, 24 P.3d 661 (2001).\n\nDefendant's claim of justification, in defense against prosecution for terroristic threatening, was established regardless of whether or not defendant used deadly force. 1 H. App. 167, 616 P.2d 229 (1980).\n\nOne may be charged with a violation of §707-716(1)(d) when a dangerous instrument is employed in connection with a threat to property as proscribed by this section. 88 H. 477 (App.), 967 P.2d 674 (1998).\n\n§707-715 Commentary:\n\n1.

The legislature felt that raising the penalty would provide an incentive for vigorous prosecution and act as a deterrent against such offenses. House Standing Committee Report No. 673. For discussion of a \"common scheme\" under §707-716, see Senate Standing Committee Report No. 902.\n\nAct 131, Session Laws 1989, amended §707-716 to establish the offense of terroristic threatening of an educational worker to make our school environments safer and to better enable prosecuting attorneys to obtain convictions. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 998.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §707-716(1) to limit the charge of terroristic threatening in the first degree against a public servant to actions arising out of the performance of the public servant's official duties. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 79, Session Laws 2007, amended §707-716(1) by establishing a criminal offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree if a person commits terroristic threatening against any emergency medical services personnel [engaged in the performance of duty]. The legislature found that emergency medical services personnel are at a heightened risk of personal injury or death from patients and others with whom they are in contact in the course of their work. By the very nature of the job, emergency medical services personnel respond to people in distressful situations, which include incidences of criminal violence, family disputes, and drunken brawls. Although the legislature acknowledged that much of the violence promulgated from explosive situations involving agitated people who lack momentary self-control, the legislature believed that emergency medical [services] personnel should be afforded the same protection as correctional workers and educational workers. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1244.\n\nAct 146, Session Laws 2010, amended §707-716(1) by expanding the class of emergency services providers protected against terroristic threatening to include, among others, physicians, physician's assistants, nurses, and nurse practitioners providing medical services in a hospital emergency room. The legislature found that emergency medical workers serve an indispensable public need but face a high level of risk in the line of duty. Nationally, studies show that between thirty-five per cent and eighty per cent of hospital staff have been physically assaulted at least once and that nurses are at an increased risk for violence while on duty. The legislature found that extending the offense of assault in the second degree to include actions against emergency services providers in emergency rooms is a logical extension of the existing provisions covering emergency response personnel. Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 2989 and 2765, House Standing Committee Report No. 466-10, Conference Committee Report No. 33-10.\n\nAct 63, Session Laws 2011, amended §707-716(1) by establishing first degree terroristic threatening for a person who threatens a person: (1) from whom the defendant has been restrained, by order of any court, from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing pursuant to domestic abuse protective orders; or (2) who is being protected by a police officer ordering the defendant to leave the premises of the protected person, during the effective period of the order. The legislature found that domestic violence victims need added protection under Hawaii law. Restraining orders or orders from police officers to abusers to leave the premises are intended to remove abusers from the vicinity of domestic violence victims and provide safety. The legislature believed that domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable when they attempt to disengage from their abusers and at that time, violence and the threat of violence are at the most extreme levels. Increasing the penalties against abusers in those situations may deter violent retaliation and may help break victims from the cycle of violence. House Standing Committee Report No. 930, Conference Committee Report No. 74, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1255.\n\nAct 255, Session Laws 2013, amended §707-716(1) to include the use of a simulated firearm in the offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree. The legislature found that simulated firearms are becoming increasingly difficult to discern from real firearms and as a result, simulated firearms are being used to commit serious criminal offenses. The victims in these crimes believe that the weapons are real and are terrorized when threatened with one. Under existing law, if the weapon is not a real firearm, the suspect cannot be charged with the higher offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree and the charge is reduced to a misdemeanor. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 488, House Standing Committee Report No. 1231.\n\nAct 52, Session Laws 2023, amended §707-716(2) to elevate terroristic threatening in the first degree to a class B felony if committed with a firearm. The legislature found that, although the United States Supreme Court held inNew York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111 (2022), that licenses to carry a firearm shall be granted unless there is an objective statutory basis requiring denial, states still retained the authority to enact a variety of gun regulations, such as prohibiting the carrying of firearms in sensitive locations and adopting laws to ensure that those who carry firearms are law-abiding, responsible citizens. Accordingly, Act 52 updated the State's existing firearms laws to ensure the safety and welfare of citizens as a result ofBruen.

[L 1972, c 9, pt of §1; am L 1981, c 171, §2; gen ch 1993; am L 2015, c 35, §24]\n\nA specific unanimity jury instruction was not required for offense of second degree unlawful imprisonment under this section where defendant's conduct, as proved by the prosecution, constituted a continuing course of conduct \"set on foot by a single impulse and operated by an unintermittent force\", with \"one general intent ... and one continuous plan\". 95 H. 440, 24 P.3d 32 (2001).\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §707-720 TO 707-722\n\nThese three offenses are gradations based upon the underlying conduct of interference with a person's liberty. The gradations are based upon the seriousness of the circumstances or purpose attending this interference. The interference with liberty is dealt with under the general definition of \"restrain.\"[1]\n\nWhere the restraint is for the purpose of personal gain, or for certain purposes which are themselves unlawful, the offense is termed \"kidnapping,\" and the most severe sanctions apply.[2] The statutory provision for mitigation, in cases where the victim is released unharmed, is intended (1) to differentiate according to the severity of the actual harm involved, and (2) to encourage the actor to proceed less dangerously once the criminal course of conduct has begun.[3]\n\nPrevious Hawaii law defined kidnapping as the forceful, fraudulent, or deceitful imprisonment, seizing, detention, or inveiglement of any person.[4] The difficulty in dealing with such words is immediately apparent. Moreover, the mandatory term of life imprisonment is thought somewhat too harsh to be imposed as a rule. Instances of kidnapping which are so heinous as to call for a sanction commensurate with that for murder will almost necessarily fall under the provisions for extended sentences, whereby the normal sentence for a class A felony may be extended to life imprisonment.[5] The Code's sentence is commensurate with that of the Model Penal Code and with most recent state revisions.[6]\n\nWhere the restraint poses a danger of serious injury, or where it involves involuntary servitude, the offense, defined in §707-721, is \"unlawful imprisonment in the first degree.\" This offense is a class C felony, commensurate with 18 U.S.C. § §1581 et seq., which, enacted pursuant to the Thirteenth Amendment, makes it a felony to hold or return a person \"to a condition of peonage,\" or to kidnap, carry away, or hold a person to be \"sold into involuntary servitude, or held as a slave.\"\n\nUnlawful imprisonment in the second degree consists of any knowing restraint of another person. The offense is graded as a misdemeanor, and is commensurate with the common-law offense of false imprisonment: it is also the substantial equivalent of \"unlawful imprisonment\" under previous Hawaii law.[7] The lawful exercise of custodial powers over a minor is, of course, excluded from the operation of this section.\n\nIt must be noted that, in all the above offenses involving interference with personal liberty, the duration of restraint necessary for conviction depends upon the intent and attendant circumstances. In this regard, something like a reasonable standard applies. Hence, a short restraint in an area where the victim might suffocate or come to other bodily harm would constitute a substantial interference with liberty under these sections. However, a short restraint in a store, based on a reasonable suspicion of shoplifting, would not amount to a substantial interference with liberty for the purposes of these offenses.8\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON § §707-720 TO 707-722\n\nWhen the legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it added the affirmative defense now set forth in §707-722(3). It is an attempt to assure that reasonable restraint is allowed for the purpose of apprehending persons suspected of \"shoplifting.\"\n\nThe Conference Committee Report of the legislature stated:\n\nIt is the intent of your Committee that \"reasonable grounds\" includes, but is not limited to, knowledge that a person has concealed possession of unpurchased merchandise of the retail mercantile establishment; that \"reasonable time\" means the time necessary to permit the person detained to make a statement or to refuse to make a statement, and the time necessary to examine employees, and records of the mercantile establishment relative to the ownership of the merchandise; and that \"retail mercantile establishment\" means a place where goods, wares, or merchandise are offered to the public for sale.

A primary reason for creating the felony offense was to enable the State to utilize its power of extradition and to seek federal assistance under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-611). Senate Standing Committee Report No. 792, House Standing Committee Report No. 613. Section 707-727 retains most of the language of repealed §707-723 and reclassifies the offense as custodial interference in the second degree.\n\nAct 48, Session Laws 1982, amended §707-726 by making the violation of an ex parte temporary restraining order, formerly treated as a misdemeanor, a class C felony. This amendment will provide for punishment commensurate with the violation and allow for the utilization of interstate and federal law enforcement agencies to assist in the return of the absent person.\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, amended §707-726 by creating a new class C felony for any person who knowingly takes or entices another person less than eleven years old from that person's lawful custodian, if that taking was with the knowledge that the actor had no right to do so. Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\nAct 245, Session Laws 1994, amended §707-726 to make it an offense to intentionally or knowingly violate a court order or take, entice, conceal, or detain a minor or child. Act 245 amended §707-727 to make it an offense to intentionally or knowingly take, entice, conceal, or detain a minor or incompetent person, and created a class C felony for custodial interference in the second degree if the minor or incompetent person is taken, enticed, concealed, or detained outside of the State. The amendments to the sections were made to include penalties and language necessary to trigger the assistance of federal authorities. Conference Committee Report No. 26.\n\nAct 146, Session Laws 1996, amended §707-726 by broadening the offense of custodial interference in the first degree to include the abduction and removal of a child from the State by any person in violation of a court order or before a court order is issued. Under current law, if there is no court order determining custody, a parent who interferes with another parent's right to custody does not commit custodial interference. When a parent takes a child out-of-state, law enforcement is unable to commence an investigation until after a court order determining the child's custody has been made. Current law thus delays the search for the child taken out-of-state. Act 146 also expanded the definition of the person acting. The legislature found that parents and relatives who want to gain physical custody of a child through self-help will seek the assistance of any willing person. The Act also defined \"good cause\" and made \"good cause\" an affirmative defense to a prosecution for custodial interference in the first degree.

[L 1986, c 314, pt of §57; am L 1991, c 214, §2]\n\nDefendant did not act intentionally under circumstances likely to cause affront by exposing defendant's genitals to a fellow sunbather where, since other sunbather was also nude, there was no logical or rational basis for concluding that defendant intended to cause affront to other sunbather. 94 H. 60, 8 P.3d 1224 (2000).\n\nIndecent exposure, in violation of this section, does not constitute an offense that entails \"criminal sexual conduct\" and, consequently, persons convicted of indecent exposure are not \"sex offenders\" for purposes of chapter 846E; thus, defendant was not required to register as a \"sex offender\" pursuant to chapter 846E. 102 H. 383, 76 P.3d 935 (2003).\n\nNo double jeopardy for convictions under this section and §712-1217. 8 H. App. 535, 813 P.2d 335 (1991).\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §707-730 TO 707-734\n\nAct 314, Session Laws 1986, incorporated all of the sexual offenses into five degrees of sexual assault. These new crimes comprise a graduated series of offenses from a class A felony to a petty misdemeanor, providing punishment reflecting the seriousness of the offense committed. As a result of the changes the \"voluntary social companion\" distinction no longer exists between what was first and second degree rape and sodomy. Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\nAct 214, Session Laws 1991, amended §707-733 by providing that a person commits fourth degree sexual assault if that person knowingly trespasses on property for the purpose of surreptitious surveillance. This will avoid prosecuting innocent passersby and distinguishes this offense from simple trespass. Conference Committee Report No. 44.\n\nAct 214, Session Laws 1991, renamed §707-734 from sexual assault in the fifth degree to indecent exposure which is intended to deal with behavior such as nude sunbathing or streaking, which is likely to be an affront to a substantial part of the community. Senate Committee Report No. 1000.\n\nAct 366, Session Laws 1997, amended §707-731 to extend the existing prohibition of sexual penetration of a prisoner by a corrections officer to a general prohibition of sexual penetration of any arrested or detained person by a law enforcement officer. The legislature found that under current law, adult corrections officers are held to a higher standard of conduct in relation to their prisoners than police officers. The legislature further found that existing law recognized that a person in custody was in no position to consent to an act of sexual penetration by those incarcerating them. Thus, the legislature believed that the policy of preventing coercion by correctional officers for sexual favors from inmates and to prevent inmates from using sex to extort favors from correctional officers should be extended to all law enforcement officers. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 767, House Standing Committee Report No. 1217.\n\nAct 379, Session Laws 1997, added §707-733.5, creating a new class A felony offense known as continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years, which provides specific circumstances under which sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years is deemed a continuing offense. The legislature found that public safety demanded immediate action against sex offenders who prey on children by taking advantage of their relationship of trust with respect to the minor. According to statistics, sexual assault against minors is an offense in which an overwhelming majority of minor victims knew their perpetrator. The legislature further found that these types of cases are often difficult to prosecute given that molesters who reside in the same household with children sexually abuse their victim over an extended period of time. The child often has difficulty remembering or identifying the specific dates on which the child was molested and may even repress the memory of events. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1594, Conference Committee Report No. 28. [Act 60, Session Laws 2006, repealed §707-733.5 and added §707-733.6, which reenacted the provisions defining the crime of continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years, to reverse the effect of State v. Rabago, 103 Haw. 236 (2003). In State v. Rabago, the Hawaii supreme court stated that it was the province of the supreme court, and not the legislature, to ascertain whether, for purposes of §707-733.5, multiple acts of sexual penetration or sexual contact may be deemed a \"continuing offense.\" Act 60, Session Laws 2006, took effect upon the ratification of a constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to define what behavior constitutes a continuing course of conduct in sexual assault crimes committed against minors under the age of fourteen (SB 2246 (2006); codified at article I, §25 of the state constitution). See also Commentary for Act 60, Session Laws 2006, enacting §707-733.6.]\n\nAct 1, Second Special Session Laws 2001, amended § §707-730 and 707-732 to require, for the offenses of sexual assault in the first degree and sexual assault in the third degree, that the minor be at least fourteen years old but less than sixteen years old, and the defendant be at least five years older than the minor and not married to the minor. The legislature found that, in many cases, minors lacked the capacity to understand the responsibilities and ramifications of engaging in a sexual relationship with adults. Current law allowed adults to enter into consensual sexual relationships with minors as young as fourteen years old without penalty. The legislature believed that these minors were unfairly burdened with the presumption of knowing the consequences of engaging in sexual relations with an adult, and that the Act would protect Hawaii's children from harmful sexual relationships with adults. Conference Committee Report No. 66, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1394.\n\nAct 36, Session Laws 2002, amended § §707-731 and 707-732 to prohibit private company employees at correctional facilities or in other residential services under the director of public safety from knowingly subjecting imprisoned persons to sexual contact or sexual penetration. The legislature found inmates particularly vulnerable to sexual assaults from employees at correctional facilities. Private employees associated with the prison system were in the same position of authority as state employees over the inmates they supervised.\n\nThe legislature found that although current state law prohibited sexual assaults against inmates in Hawaii correctional facilities, no reference was made to correctional facilities operated by private companies. The legislature further found that the law could be construed to exclude acts by employees of private companies working in state correctional facilities. Act 36 addressed this \"loophole\" in the law by ensuring that sexual offenses committed by any correctional facility employee against inmates were prohibited, regardless of the employer's status as a public or private facility. House Standing Committee Report No. 696-02, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3162.\n\nAct 62, Session Laws 2003, amended § §707-730 and 707-732 by removing the sunset provision of Act 1, Second Special Session Laws 2001, which raised the age at which a person can consent to sexual contact from fourteen to sixteen years of age in most cases. Act 62 made permanent the provisions that raised the age of consent to sixteen in most cases. House Standing Committee Report No. 568.\n\nAct 10, Session Laws 2004, amended § §707-730 and 707-732 by amending Act 62, Session Laws 2003, to include the amendment to §707-732 by Act 36, Session Laws 2002. Sections 707-730 and 707-732 were amended by Act 1, Second Special Session Laws 2001, subject to repeal and reenactment on June 30, 2003. Act 36, Session Laws 2002, amended the repeal and reenactment provisions of Act 1, Second Special Session Laws 2001, to exempt Act 36's amendment of §707-732 from the repeal and reenactment. Act 62, Session Laws 2003, deleted the repeal and reenactment provision by amending Act 1, Second Special Session Laws 2001, but not Act 36, Session Laws 2002. House Standing Committee Report No. 1015-4.\n\nAct 61, Session Laws 2004, amended § §707-731 and 707-732 by including as a victim of sexual assault in the second degree, a person committed to the director of public safety and knowingly subjected to sexual penetration, and by amending the offense of sexual assault in the third degree to include law enforcement officers who knowingly subject to sexual contact a person confined to a detention facility or in custody. The Act created uniformity between the offenses of sexual assault in the second degree and in the third degree.\n\nAct 61 also corrected an error in §707-732. The purpose of the 2002 amendment to § §707-731 and 707-732 was to include employees of private companies in correctional facilities in sexual offense statutes that prohibit sexual contact and penetration with imprisoned persons or persons confined in a detention facility. However, the 2002 amendment inadvertently excluded state-employed law enforcement officers and only prohibited private company employees from committing the acts. Act 61 corrected the mistake by including state-employed law enforcement officers and clarified language regarding what does and does not constitute an offense. Conference Committee Report No. 35-04, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3121.\n\nAct 60, Session Laws 2006, added §707-733.6, reenacting provisions that define the behavior that constitutes the crime of continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years and the unanimity required to convict a person of the crime. Act 60, along with the proposed constitutional amendment in Senate Bill 2246, was intended to reverse the effect of State v. Rabago, 103 Haw. 236 (2003). Under the current law, it is difficult to prosecute persons who repeatedly sexually assault young children because of the difficulty the children have in remembering the individual dates on which they were sexually assaulted. Act 60 permitted the conviction of a person of the continuous sexual assault of a child, if each member of the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had sexually assaulted the child the required minimum number of times, even without unanimity as to the individual assaults, thus making it easier to prosecute those who repeatedly sexually assault children. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3010, House Standing Committee Report No. 150-06.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §707-730(1) by adding [the offense of knowingly subjecting to sexual penetration another person who is mentally defective and] the offense of date rape as sexual assault in the first degree. House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\nAct 230, Session Laws 2006, amended §707-731(1) by deleting the offense of knowingly subjecting to sexual penetration another person who is mentally defective as sexual assault in the second degree to conform to the amendment made in §707-730(1) by the Act.\n\nAct 11, Session Laws 2009, amended § §707-730(1), 707-731(1), and 707-732(1), by deleting references to chapter 460, relating to osteopathy, which was repealed by Act 5, Session Laws 2008. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 49.\n\nAct 153, Session Laws 2016, amended §707-731 to include within the offense of sexual assault in the second degree a person who knowingly subjects to sexual penetration a minor at least sixteen years of age if the person is contemporaneously acting in a professional capacity to instruct, advise, or supervise the minor, with certain exceptions. The legislature found that sexual relations between a person who is younger than sixteen years, the age of consent, and a person who is not less than five years older was a crime even if the younger person consents. However, once a minor attains sixteen years of age, consensual sexual activity was not a crime and the minor was not protected from adults who abuse the power of their position to obtain consent. House Standing Committee Report No. 280-16, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3309.\n\nAct 153, Session Laws 2016, amended §707-733 to include within the offense of sexual assault in the fourth degree a person who knowingly engages in or causes sexual contact with a minor who is at least sixteen years old but less than eighteen years old if the person is contemporaneously acting in a professional capacity to instruct, advise, or supervise the minor, with certain exceptions. The legislature found that sexual relations between a person who is younger than sixteen years, the age of consent, and a person who is not less than five years older was a crime even if the younger person consents. However, once a minor attains sixteen years of age, consensual sexual activity was not a crime and the minor was not protected from adults who abuse the power of their position to obtain consent. House Standing Committee Report No. 280-16, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3309.\n\nAct 231, Session Laws 2016, amended §707-733(1) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).\n\nAct 22, Session Laws 2021, amended §707-731 to provide that the offense of sexual assault in the second degree includes offenses against a person who is stopped by a law enforcement officer and against a person who is accompanied by a law enforcement officer for official purposes. Act 22 also amended §707-732 to provide that the offense of sexual assault in the third degree includes offenses against a person who is stopped by a law enforcement officer and against a person who is accompanied by a law enforcement officer for official purposes. The legislature found that there was an incident in which a Honolulu police officer was indicted for the offense of sexual assault in the third degree for knowingly subjecting a teenage girl in custody to sexual contact. The indictment was based upon the interpretation that a person being stopped by a police officer for a traffic infraction was in \"custody.\" However, the indictment was dismissed with prejudice because the court determined that the term \"custody\" did not include a traffic stop, for purposes of the offense. The legislature further found that during a traffic stop, the person stopped by the officer is not free to go without permission of the officer, and that their actions during the traffic stop are constrained by legal requirements that, if violated, can subject the person to legal penalties, including possible criminal prosecution. The legislature additionally found it appropriate and in the public interest to clarify that the offenses of sexual assault in the second degree and sexual assault in the third degree include, and explicitly prohibit, a law enforcement officer from knowingly subjecting to sexual penetration or sexual contact, a person who is being stopped by the officer or accompanied by the officer for official purposes, including during a traffic stop. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1210.\n\nAct 239, Session Laws 2021, amended §707-730 to provide that a perpetrator commits the offense of sexual assault in the first degree if the perpetrator was negligent in not knowing of the mental defect of the victim. Act 239 also amended §707-732 to provide that a perpetrator commits the offense of sexual assault in the third degree if the perpetrator was negligent in not knowing of the mental defect of the victim. The legislature found that mentally disabled persons need additional protection from sexual predators. Among developmentally disabled adults, as many as 83 per cent of females and 32 per cent of males had been victims of sexual assault. The legislature further found that anywhere from fifteen thousand to nineteen thousand people with developmental disabilities were sexually assaulted each year in the United States. Forty per cent of people with developmental disabilities who were victims of sexual violence would experience ten or more abusive incidents. The legislature additionally found that mentally disabled persons and developmentally disabled persons have limited, if any, capacity to give knowing and willing consent to sexual acts. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1211, Conference Committee Report No. 6.\n\nAct 278, Session Laws 2022, amended § §707-731 and 707-732 to replace references to \"director of public safety\" with \"director of corrections and rehabilitation\" to reflect the provisions in Act 278 that: (1) reestablished the department of public safety as an independent department of corrections and rehabilitation to administer the corrections, rehabilitation, and reentry of the inmate population; and (2) established a department of law enforcement to consolidate and administer certain criminal law enforcement and investigative functions of the department of public safety, department of transportation, department of the attorney general, and office of homeland security. The legislature found that the goals and functions of corrections and law enforcement are distinct, and separating the functions of the department of public safety into two departments would advance these distinct goals and objectives while allowing the corrections arm to more fully integrate strategies for rehabilitation. The legislature further found that reorganizing certain state law enforcement functions into a single entity with consistent training opportunities would allow for the efficient use of resources in administering correctional programs and improve decision making, promote accountability, streamline communication, decrease costs, reduce duplication of efforts, provide uniform training and standards, and promote uniform standards of law enforcement services.

The legislature rejected this concept, however, since it felt that there is little probability of corroborating evidence in the cases listed in part V. The legislature felt that the corroborating evidence requirement would prevent effective enforcement of the acts prohibited under this part.

Dealing with activities involving the participation of children without attempting to define the conduct in terms of pornography, these sections classify the offenses as offenses against the person rather than pornography.

Senate Conference Committee Report No. 27-78, House Conference Committee Report No. 21.\n\nAct 218, Session Laws 1982, amended these sections to clarify that the offense of promoting child abuse applies to the use of minors in pornographic material. Section 707-751 was found to be unconstitutional because \"the statute prohibited speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution ... and because the statute did not incorporate the three-part test defining obscenity as enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Miller v. California, the statute prohibited non-obscene as well as obscene materials.\" The constitutionality of the section is on appeal but the legislature found \"that any question as to what is being prohibited should be clarified.\" House Conference Committee Report No. 4, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 3.\n\nAct 91, Session Laws 1988, amended §707-750 by reclassifying the offense of promoting child abuse in the first degree from a class B felony to a class A felony. The legislature found that victims of child abuse are the least able to defend themselves, and the resulting emotional scars of these victims increase the likelihood of further contact with the criminal justice system; therefore, a more severe punishment for this offense is warranted. The legislature also found that reclassifying this offense will make the classification consistent with the current penalty for sexual abuse in the first degree involving a minor. House Standing Committee Report No. 481-88, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2545.\n\nAct 363, Session Laws 1997, amended § §707-750 and 707-751 to include persons producing or making pornographic material involving minors under the offense of child abuse. The legislature found that under existing child abuse laws, in order for a person to be charged with child abuse, the pornographic materials must show a minor engaged in or assisting others to engage in a sexual act. This loophole in the law allowed persons producing those materials to exploit children by using them in sexually explicit poses without technically violating the law. The legislature believed that it was important to extend the scope of the offense of child abuse to include producing material in which children are exploited through sexually explicit conduct.\n\nThe Act also, inter alia, amended the definition of \"sexual conduct\" to include lascivious exhibition of the genital or pubic area of a minor, and added the definitions of \"lascivious\" and \"community standards,\" in both § §707-750 and 707-751. Section 707-751 was also amended to include possession of pornographic material involving children as an offense. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 757, House Standing Committee Report No. 1214.\n\nAct 200, Session Laws 2002, amended § §707-750 and 707-751 by, among other things, defining \"child pornography\" to encompass computer-generated representations of minors. The legislature found that Act 200 addressed the problem of utilizing computer technology in committing crimes against children. House Standing Committee Report No. 417-02, Conference Committee Report No. 36-02.\n\nAct 212, Session Laws 2012, amended §707-751 to provide greater protection for children by addressing instances of possession of particularly violent or egregious child pornography. Specifically, Act 212 amended the offense of promoting child abuse in the second degree to include possession of thirty or more images of child pornography where the content of at least one image contains a minor younger than the age of twelve, sadomasochistic abuse of a minor, or bestiality involving a minor. The legislature found that child pornography was a permanent record of the actual sexual abuse, exploitation, and assault of innocent and helpless children. The legislature further found that Hawaii's child pornography laws should be strengthened and should distinguish between the various forms of child pornography. Prior to Act 212, possession of any form of child pornography was covered under the offense of promoting child abuse in the third degree, but a violation was only a class C felony. Act 212 amended the offense of promoting child abuse in the second degree, a class B felony, to include particularly violent or egregious child pornography. Conference Committee Report No. 24-12.\n\nAct 16, Session Laws 2016, amended § §707-750 and 707-751 by amending the definition of the term \"sexual conduct\" as that term is used in the Penal Code for the offenses of promoting child abuse in the first and second degrees. The amendments made by Act 16 aligned the term, as used in state law, more closely with the terminology used in federal law by expanding the definition of \"sexual conduct\" to include specific types of conduct. Act 16 also removed unnecessary and archaic language regarding sexual orientation. House Standing Committee Report No. 1124-16.",

With respect to the computer-use requirement, the State was required to prove that defendant used a computer or electronic device only to communicate with \"Chyla\". 131 H. 379, 319 P.3d 298 (2013).\n\nChallenge to the validity of this section under the doctrine of the dormant commerce clause was without merit, as the electronic enticement statutory prohibition does not interfere with, or does not involve, interstate commerce. 134 H. 515, 345 P.3d 181 (2015).\n\nIn light of the plain language of this section, its legislative history, and the doctrine of in pari materia, the \"intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony\" set forth in the agreement element applies to that element only. 134 H. 515, 345 P.3d 181 (2015).\n\nThis section is not overbroad because it: (1) does not implicate the freedoms of expression guaranteed under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or article I, §4 of the Hawaii constitution; and (2) does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. 134 H. 515, 345 P.3d 181 (2015).\n\nThis section is not rendered unconstitutionally vague by its use of the word \"communicates\", which is undefined, or by its reference to covered offenses under §846E-1, which includes catch-all clauses and conviction clauses; the catch-all clauses, conviction clauses, and term \"communicates\" provide citizens of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is prohibited and provides explicit standards for those who apply the statute to do so in a consistent and nondiscriminatory manner. 134 H. 515, 345 P.3d 181 (2015).\n\nThis section does not concern interstate commerce, and therefore, scrutiny under the commerce clause was not appropriate. Assuming, arguendo, that this section warranted commerce clause scrutiny, this section does not violate the dormant commerce clause. 131 H. 312 (App.), 318 P.3d 602 (2013).\n\nThis section was not unconstitutionally overbroad and/or vague as applied to defendant, and the circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on that basis where, among other things, when the statute was read as a whole, it was clear that only criminal conduct was proscribed and the statute plainly criminalized conduct that is coupled with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony. 131 H. 312 (App.), 318 P.3d 602 (2013).\n\nTrial court did not err in rejecting defendant's proffered reason for requesting the withdrawal of defendant's second guilty plea on the ground that defendant had not been aware of a potentially meritorious defense that the State was unable to prove that defendant had traveled to the agreed upon meeting place as required under subsection (1)(c), where transcripts of the internet chat room conversations defendant had with minor provided compelling evidence that the meeting place was the Burger King, not a particular area within the Burger King. 120 H. 480 (App.), 210 P.3d 3 (2009).\n\nWhere it was not necessary for defendant to actually commit one of the felony offenses defined in §846E-1 in order to violate the prohibition against the electronic enticement of a child under subsection (1) but only necessary under subsection (1)(b)(iii) that defendant act with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony offense defined in §846E-1, the State was not required to specify in the indictment which §846E-1 felony offense defendant intended to promote or facilitate. 120 H. 480 (App.), 210 P.3d 3 (2009).\n\nWhere State presented evidence to the grand jury that the person communicating with defendant represented to defendant that the person was a 14-year old girl, the State was not required to prove under subsection (1)(a)(iii) that defendant engaged in communication with an actual child, and the record showed that the agreed upon meeting place was the Burger King and not a specific table within the Burger King, evidence before the grand jury that defendant arrived at the Burger King and was arrested was sufficient to establish probable cause regarding the meeting place element. 120 H. 480 (App.), 210 P.3d 3 (2009).\n\nCircuit court did not abuse its discretion under HRE rule 403 in admitting video showing defendant masturbating for \"child\" where video: (1) was extremely probative of defendant's intent to promote or facilitate the commission of one of the predicate felonies necessary to prove first degree electronic enticement of a child under this section; (2) provided clear evidence of defendant's motives and desires regarding the \"child\" and the extreme actions defendant was willing to undertake in order to entice the \"child\"; and (3) was the strongest evidence of defendant's intention to engage in sexual activity with the \"child\". 128 H. 328 (App.), 289 P.3d 964 (2012).\n\nThis section does not require proof that a defendant used a computer or other electronic device to travel to the agreed upon meeting place and the legislature did not intend the statute to require that the agreement to meet be accomplished through the use of a computer or other electronic device; requiring proof that the defendant used a computer to travel to the agreed upon meeting place at the agreed upon meeting time would lead to absurd results; thus, the circuit court did not erroneously instruct the jury on the elements for the charged offense of first degree electronic enticement of a child. 128 H. 328 (App.), 289 P.3d 964 (2012).",

The legislature rejected a provision making acts which caused the victim \"great mental anguish\" extortion in the first degree on the grounds that such a standard is too subjective, and would differ from one individual to the next. Conference Committee Report No. 43.\n\nAct 28, Session Laws 1993, amended §707-766 by stating the elements of the offense of extortion in the second degree in the disjunctive, consistent with the intent of the 1979 legislature in enacting that section, and by making the language of that section gender neutral. House Standing Committee Report No. 190, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1121.\n\nAct 383, Session Laws 1997, amended §707-769 to provide a defense to prosecution for extortion to reciprocal beneficiaries. In establishing the status of reciprocal beneficiaries, the Act provides certain rights and benefits, and represents a commitment to provide substantially similar government rights to those couples who are barred by law from marriage. Conference Committee Report No. 2.\n\nAct 33, Session Laws 2001, strengthened the State's computer crime laws by, among other things, amending §707-764 to clarify the offense of extortion to include threatening by word or conduct to cause damage to a computer, computer system, or computer network. The legislature found that society was adopting at a rapid pace, computer technology to conduct activities of daily living. Computer technology was being utilized not only for purposes of business and recreation, but also for criminal activity. Thus, computer-related criminal activity was on the rise as society's dependence on computers increased. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1508.\n\nAct 147, Session Laws 2008, amended §707-764 by adding a reference to unlawfully obtaining \"labor\" [in paragraph (1)], and by adding as an element of the offense of extortion, to destroy, conceal, remove, confiscate, or possess a passport or other government identification or immigration document of another person. The legislature strengthened the laws on prostitution and related offenses to deter and punish sexual exploitation of minors, including obscenity-related activities. Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.\n\nAct 147, Session Laws 2008, amended § §707-765(1), 707-666(1), and 707-767(1) by adding a reference to \"labor\" as an element of the offenses of extortion in the first, second, and third degrees. Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.\n\nAct 35, Session Laws 2015, amended §707-769(1) by changing the phrase \"claim or right\" to \"claim of right.\"",

[L 2011, c 146, pt of §1]\n\nCOMMENTARY ON § §707-780 TO 707-787\n\nAct 146, Session Laws 2011, established, among other things, a class A and class B felony offense for labor trafficking, an offense for nonpayment of wages, and an offense for unlawful conduct with respect to documents. The legislature found that Hawaii is one of only five states without a specific labor trafficking statute, yet labor trafficking has occurred at an unprecedented level in the State. Act 146 sent an unmistakable warning to individuals and entities engaged in labor trafficking and provided a clearer and more structured means for law enforcement agencies to protect and aid trafficking victims. Also, Act 146 would be a catalyst for law enforcement agencies, service providers, and other state agencies and community organizations to engage in needed training and education on labor trafficking.
