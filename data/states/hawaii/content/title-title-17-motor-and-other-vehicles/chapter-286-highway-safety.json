Upon so doing, the director of finance shall send to the registered owner a notice by mail of the action.\n\n(h) Any person who refuses or neglects to deliver a certificate of ownership to a transferee entitled thereto under this part, shall be punished as provided in section 286-61.\n\n(i) Every dealer, upon transferring a motor vehicle, whether by sale, lease, or otherwise, shall immediately give notice of the transfer to the director of finance upon the official form provided by the director of finance.

The test examiners shall communicate with the applicant only in English during the skills test. As of January 30, 2012, the examiner of drivers shall verify that the medical certification status of a driver who self-certified according to title 49 Code of Federal Regulations section 383.71(b)(1)(i), non-excepted interstate, is certified.

When driving a commercial motor vehicle, the holder of a commercial learner's permit shall be accompanied by a person with a valid commercial driver's license to operate that category of commercial motor vehicle with the proper endorsements. The licensed person shall occupy the seat beside the individual for the purpose of giving instruction in driving the commercial motor vehicle. The commercial learner's permit may be renewed no more than an additional one hundred eighty days without requiring the commercial learner's permit holder to retake the general or endorsement knowledge tests, and the applicant requalifies meeting the requirements of subsection (d).

The district judge shall hear and determine:\n\n(1) Whether the law enforcement officer who stopped or detained the driver had probable cause to believe that the driver had been either driving or in actual physical control of a commercial motor vehicle, while having any alcohol in the driver's body;\n\n(2) Whether the driver was lawfully stopped or detained;\n\n(3) Whether the law enforcement officer informed the driver of the sanctions of section 286-240;\n\n(4) Whether the driver submitted to a test or tests of the driver's breath or blood or refused to be tested; and\n\n(5) If the driver submitted to a test or tests, whether the driver's alcohol concentration was 0.04 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath or 0.04 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.\n\nThe amount of alcohol found in the driver's blood within three hours after the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis or other analytical techniques of the defendant's blood or breath shall be competent evidence that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the alleged violation. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the introduction of relevant evidence of a person's blood alcohol content obtained more than three hours after an alleged violation; provided that the evidence is offered in compliance with the Hawaii rules of evidence. If the judge finds the statements contained in the affidavit are true, the judge shall disqualify the driver from driving a commercial motor vehicle as provided by section 286-240.
