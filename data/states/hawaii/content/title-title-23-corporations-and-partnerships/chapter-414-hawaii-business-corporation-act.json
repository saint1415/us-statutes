An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.\n\n(b) An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within ninety days after the filing of the petition under section 414-411(2) or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation, within ten days thereafter, shall give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioning shareholder. The notice shall state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioning shareholder and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and shall advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate shall file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than thirty days after the effective date of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to their ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under section 414-411(2) may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholder's shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioning shareholder, to permit the discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition.\n\n(c) If, within sixty days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioning shareholder's shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of the petitioning shareholder's shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.\n\n(d) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (c), the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the section 414-411(2) proceedings and determine the fair value of the petitioning shareholder's shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under section 414-411(2) was filed or as of any other date the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n(e) Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon the terms and conditions that the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees, and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating the petitioning shareholder's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court shall attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under section 414-411(2)(B) or (D), it may award to the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of any experts employed by the petitioning shareholder.\n\n(f) Upon entry of an order under subsection (c) or (e), the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under section 414-411, and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded to the petitioning shareholder by the order of the court that shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.\n\n(g) The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (e), shall be made within ten days after the date the order becomes final unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt articles of dissolution pursuant to sections 414-382 and 414-383, which articles shall then be adopted and filed within fifty days thereafter. Upon filing of the articles of dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with sections 414-385 to 414-387, and the order entered pursuant to subsection (e) shall no longer be of any force or effect, except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of subsection (e) and the petitioning shareholder may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.\n\n(h) Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under subsection (c) or (e), other than an award of fees and expenses pursuant to subsection (e), is subject to section 414-111.
