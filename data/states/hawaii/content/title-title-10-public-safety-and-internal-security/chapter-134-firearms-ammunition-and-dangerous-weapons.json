Rev. 575 (1995).\n\nSummary judgment granted to defendants where plaintiff's 1997 harassment conviction constituted a conviction for a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" and, as a matter of statutory construction, the unavailability of a procedure for either expungement, set-aside, pardon, or civil rights restoration did not remove plaintiff from the ambit of federal prohibition or by extension, this section. 855 F.3d 1067 (2017).\n\nDefendant police chief was entitled to qualified immunity from plaintiff firearm permit applicant's 42 U.S.C. §1983 claims for monetary damages for alleged violations of plaintiff's Second Amendment right to bear arms and Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process right because a reasonable official in defendant's circumstances would not have understood that defendant's conduct violated a right that was clearly established at the time of the denial of plaintiff's permit; this section, on which the denial was based, had not been invalidated by case or legislative action. 869 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (2012).\n\nPlaintiff firearm permit applicant's allegations that plaintiff was denied a permit and ordered to surrender plaintiff's weapons due to a conviction of harassment under §711-1106 more than ten years before and that the conviction was not a crime of violence under subsection (b) or federal law for the purposes of prohibiting ownership or possession of firearms were sufficient to state a 42 U.S.C. §1983 claim for a violation of plaintiff's Second Amendment rights. 869 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (2012).\n\nGenuine issue of material fact existed regarding: (1) whether plaintiff had been under counseling for addiction to, abuse of, or dependence upon a drug or intoxicating liquor; and (2) whether plaintiff had been \"medically documented to be no longer adversely affected\" by drugs or intoxicating liquor. As a result, plaintiff had not established a Second Amendment right to possess firearms. 976 F. Supp. 2d 1200 (2013).\n\nSubsection (b) did not disqualify plaintiff from exercising plaintiff's Second Amendment rights because the court could not conclude that plaintiff's convictions for harassment constituted a crime of violence. 976 F. Supp. 2d 1200 (2013).\n\nWhere defendants argued that plaintiff was prohibited from possessing firearms under federal law because of the federal Lautenberg Amendment, which prohibits firearm ownership by any person who \"has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\", plaintiff's convictions for harassment did not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal law. 976 F. Supp. 2d 1200 (2013).\n\nWhere defendants asserted that plaintiff lacked standing to bring a lawsuit because plaintiff was precluded from obtaining firearms under this section, and, therefore, could not establish a violation of plaintiff's Second Amendment rights, police department's denial of plaintiff's application for a firearms permit, order to surrender firearms plaintiff possessed, and letter affirming the denial of the application constituted an \"injury-in-fact\" sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of Article III standing. 49 F. Supp. 3d 727 (2014).\n\nWhere plaintiff was disqualified from possessing firearms under 18 U.S.C. §922(g)(9) and applying subsection (a) would not have an impermissible retroactive effect, subsection (a) precluded plaintiff from acquiring a firearms permit. 49 F. Supp. 3d 727 (2014).\n\nFelon convicted of possessing firearm properly sentenced under this section instead of §706-610. 68 H. 622, 725 P.2d 799 (1986).\n\nDefendant exercised control when defendant sold gun. 70 H. 219, 768 P.2d 230 (1989).\n\nPreviously convicted felon must have intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly possessed or controlled the firearm. 70 H. 509, 778 P.2d 704 (1989).\n\nDefendant may not assert the invalidity of the prior conviction as a defense under this section. 71 H. 101, 784 P.2d 867 (1989).\n\nConvicted person may not assert the invalidity of the prior offense as a defense to this section. 71 H. 111, 784 P.2d 872 (1989).\n\nSubsection (b) applies to felons who are convicted through a nolo contendere plea. 83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1 (1996).\n\nWhere defendant's convictions were premised upon the use of \"any firearm\" and language of indictments and trial court's instructions \"to wit, a semiautomatic pistol\" did not alter the statutory elements of § §708-840, 134-6, or this section, trial court's error of not providing definition of \"semiautomatic firearm\" did not warrant reversal of convictions of first degree robbery, carrying or use of firearm in commission of separate felony, or felon in possession of firearm. 91 H. 33, 979 P.2d 1059 (1999).\n\nFor the purposes of subsection (b), \"possession\" must be analyzed using a two-pronged analysis: (1) the voluntary act of \"possession\" of an object \"itself\" is, by way of §702-202, satisfied where an individual acts knowingly with respect to his or her conduct; and (2) the requisite state of mind with respect to the attendant circumstances--i.e., the particular qualities of the object that make it illegal to possess it--is, by way of §702-204, satisfied by a reckless state of mind. 93 H. 87, 997 P.2d 13 (2000).\n\nWhere one bag containing a gun was found on truck seat next to defendant and another bag with two guns was found on truck floor where defendant had been sitting, jury could have inferred from totality of circumstances that defendant had the state of mind requisite to commit possession of a firearm and/or ammunition by a person convicted of certain crimes. 93 H. 87, 997 P.2d 13 (2000).\n\nA person commits the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm, pursuant to §705-500(1)(b) and (3), and subsection (b), if he or she intentionally engages in conduct that, under the circumstances as he or she believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct intended to culminate in his or her commission of the offense of prohibited possession of a firearm. 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479 (2000).\n\nAs the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm under this section does not include a result-of-conduct element and §705-500(2) does not therefore apply, trial court instruction erroneously defined the state of mind necessary to prove the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm as something less than intentional, as required by §705-500(1)(b). 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479 (2000).\n\nPursuant to § §701-109(4)(b), 705-500(1)(b) and (3), and subsection (b), attempted prohibited possession of a firearm is an included offense of prohibited possession of a firearm. 93 H. 199, 998 P.2d 479 (2000).\n\nWhere defendant failed to carry defendant's burden of establishing that defendant's conduct--of possessing ammunition in violation of subsection (b), a class B felony involving conduct that had the potential for serious public safety consequences--was de minimis within the meaning of §702-236, appellate court's dismissal of trial court's granting of motion to dismiss charges as a de minimis infraction under §702-236 affirmed. 123 H. 329, 235 P.3d 325 (2010).\n\nWhere the State's evidence only went so far as to show defendant's ownership and presence in the vehicle and defendant's proximity to the firearm and ammunition, absent evidence of intent, the circuit court correctly granted defendant's renewed motion of judgment of acquittal; the appeals court thus erred in vacating circuit court's judgment by concluding that there was sufficient evidence of intent for jury to infer that defendant constructively possessed the subject rifle and ammunition in violation of subsection (b). 128 H. 18, 282 P.3d 560 (2012).\n\nRequisite state of mind for a violation of subsection (b) is that of acting intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; failure to instruct jury on state of mind element, as required by §701-114(1)(b), was prejudicial and not harmless error. 78 H. 422 (App.), 895 P.2d 173 (1995).\n\nWhere State failed to establish defendant's prior felony conviction and no lesser included offense of a felon in possession of a firearm or ammunition in chapter 134, defendant's convictions of being a felon in possession of a firearm and firearm ammunition under subsection (b) reversed. 82 H. 517 (App.), 923 P.2d 934 (1996).\n\nUnder subsection (b), multiple punishments are not authorized for violating the prohibition against possession of \"any firearm or ammunition therefor\"; thus, where defendant was already convicted of possessing a firearm, defendant could not be convicted for possession of ammunition loaded into that firearm. 89 H. 59 (App.), 968 P.2d 1070 (1998).\n\nAlthough evidence that defendant had previously been convicted of a felony was relevant for purposes of this section, evidence that defendant may have received ineffective assistance of counsel during that prior felony trial would not have any bearing on the validity of that felony conviction; thus, trial court did not err in precluding evidence that defendant may have received ineffective assistance during prior trial. 90 H. 489 (App.), 979 P.2d 85 (1999).\n\nUnless expressly permitted by the court, subsection (f) unqualifiedly prohibits a person subject to a chapter 586 order from possession and control of a firearm during the pendency of that order; this prohibition is effective irrespective of whether the respondent owned the firearms involved. 91 H. 438 (App.), 984 P.2d 1264 (1999).\n\nTrial court erred in sentencing defendant to ten years of incarceration with a mandatory minimum term of ten years under §706-660.1(3)(c) as convicting defendant of being a felon in possession of a firearm pursuant to subsection (b) and sentencing defendant to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to §706-660.1(3)(c) essentially punished defendant twice for a single possession of a firearm; a rational interpretation of §706-660.1 is that the legislature did not intend its application for felonies where the entirety of the felonious conduct is the use or possession of a firearm. 107 H. 273 (App.), 112 P.3d 759 (2005).\n\nIn a prosecution of a felon under subsection (b) for possession of firearm ammunition, the State must prove, whether by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the ammunition was \"actually loaded\"; given detective's authoritative identification of the bullets as ammunition, and in the absence of evidence that the ammunition was not loaded or otherwise incapable of being fired, was substantial evidence that the ammunition was actually loaded. 108 H. 124 (App.), 117 P.3d 856 (2005).\n\nMentioned: 9 H. App. 333, 839 P.2d 1186 (1992).",

Consequently, an application should be denied when the applicant exhibits specific and articulable indicia that the applicant poses a heightened risk to public safety. Att. Gen. Op. 18-1.\n\nApplicants for an unconcealed-carry license must demonstrate a need to carry a firearm for protection that substantially exceeds the need possessed by ordinary law-abiding citizens. Att. Gen. Op. 18-1.\n\nBy its plain text, the legislative history, and applicable case law, this section does not limit unconcealed-carry licenses to private security officers and other individuals whose jobs entail the protection of life and property, but instead authorizes the issuance of those licenses to any qualified individual who demonstrates a sufficient \"urgency\" or \"need\" to carry a firearm and is \"engaged in the protection of life and property\". Att. Gen. Op. 18-1.\n\nChiefs of police may exercise reasonable discretion to deny licenses to otherwise-qualified applicants, but that discretion may not be exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner. The discretion to deny unconcealed-carry licenses to qualified applicants should be exercised only where an applicant's characteristics or circumstances render the applicant unsuitable to carry an unconcealed firearm for reasons not captured by the express statutory requirements. Discretion may not be used to effectively nullify the authorization for unconcealed-carry licenses contained in this section or to impose categorical restrictions on unconcealed-carry licenses that the legislature did not enact. Att. Gen. Op. 18-1.\n\nFollowing the decision inNew York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the requirement in this section that an applicant \"[i]n an exceptional case . . . show[] reason to fear injury to the applicant's person or property\" to obtain a concealed carry license should no longer be enforced. All other statutory requirements for obtaining a concealed carry license are unaffected byBruen. Further,Bruendoes not require any change to the requirements established under this section to obtain an unconcealed carry license. Att. Gen. Op. 22-02.\n\nDiscussed: 911 F. Supp. 2d 972 (2012).\n\nMentioned: 74 H. 197, 840 P.2d 374 (1992).",
