The lien shall be for the full amount of the charges and fees and shall attach to any aircraft owned or operated by the person owing those charges and fees. The department shall not execute on the lien until it complies with the procedures set out in subsections (b) through (h) of this section.\n\n(b) The department shall cause to be placed, upon the aircraft for which charges and fees are due, a notice which shall indicate that the operator or owner of the aircraft has failed to pay such charges and fees, the time the notice was posted, and an intention to perfect a lien on the aircraft and impound it if the operator or owner of the aircraft does not pay the charges and fees incurred within forty-eight hours of the posting of the notice.\n\n(c) Any aircraft for which the department has served notice may be summarily and administratively impounded by the department if the charges and fees which the owner or operator of the aircraft has incurred have not been paid to the department before the expiration of the forty-eight-hour notice period.\n\n(d) Within three days after the administrative impoundment of an aircraft pursuant to this section by the department, a second notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered owner and the operator, if known, and, if the operator is other than the owner or a representative of the owner of the impounded aircraft, the second notice shall be sent to the operator at the last address shown on the aircraft registration records of the Federal Aviation Administration. This second notice shall be comprised of a copy of the notice posted on the impounded aircraft at the start of the forty-eight-hour notice period, together with a demand that the owner or operator of the impounded aircraft pay the charges and fees which have been incurred.\n\n(e) Within thirty days of the impoundment by the department of an aircraft, the owner or operator of the aircraft may file a written request with the department for an administrative hearing. The sole issue to be considered at this administrative hearing is whether the owner or operator is not current in payments to the department for landing fees and other fees and charges for the use of services or airport facilities owned or operated by the department. The department shall have the burden of proof at this administrative hearing.\n\nWithin three days after receipt by the department of a written request for an administrative hearing from the owner or operator of the aircraft, the department shall conduct the requested hearing. In calculating the three-day period, weekends and holidays shall be excluded.\n\nIn all other respects, chapter 91 shall govern this administrative hearing.\n\n(f) If it is determined by the director that the owner or operator of the impounded aircraft is current in payments to the department for charges and fees, the impounded aircraft shall be immediately released by the department to the aircraft owner or operator. In addition, the department shall bear the cost and expense of impounding the aircraft.\n\n(g) If it is determined by the director that the owner or operator of the impounded aircraft is not current in payments to the department for charges and fees, the department may satisfy its lien out of the proceeds of any sale or auction of the impounded aircraft; provided that any remaining balance of the proceeds of the sale or auction, after deduction of the cost of maintenance, storage, and other costs related to the impoundment and the sale or auction conducted to satisfy the lien, shall be returned to the impounded aircraft owner or operator.\n\n(h) An owner or operator of the impounded aircraft may also obtain immediate possession of the impounded aircraft by paying to the department, without an administrative hearing, all charges and fees owed by the owner or operator of the impounded aircraft and the cost and expense of impounding the aircraft incurred by the department.\n\n(i) If the owner or operator of an impounded aircraft does not:\n\n(1) Request an administrative hearing within thirty days of the department's impounding of the aircraft; or\n\n(2) Pay the department all cost and expenses of impounding the aircraft and the charges and fees due and owing within fifteen days of a finding of probable cause that the charges and fees are due and owing,\n\nthe aircraft shall be disposed of by public auction, through oral tenders, or by sealed bids, after public notice has been given; provided that the public auction shall not be held less than five days after public notice is given. Where no bid is received, the aircraft may be sold by negotiation, disposed of as junk, or donated to any governmental agency.\n\n(j) Public auction shall not be required when the appraised value of any aircraft, as determined by an independent appraiser who has had at least one year of experience in the sale or purchase of aircraft, is less than $100. Upon that determination and after public notice is given, the director may sell the aircraft by negotiation, dispose of it as junk, or donate the aircraft to any governmental agency.\n\n(k) The transfer hereunder shall be evidenced by a bill of sale from the department, shall be considered a transfer by operation of law, and shall be governed by provisions applicable thereto.\n\n(l) A purchaser of an aircraft sold to satisfy a lien pursuant to this section shall take the aircraft free of any rights of persons against whom that lien was valid.

In carrying out this responsibility, the department shall develop and implement a master plan, hereinafter referred to as the \"helicopter master plan\", for helicopter operations for each airport under the State's control.\n\n(b) The director shall adopt a helicopter master plan for each state airport that shall include but not be limited to:\n\n(1) The extent, type, nature, location, and timing of helicopter operations and helicopter facilities development at each state airport;\n\n(2) The layout plans of existing and proposed helicopter facilities at each state airport;\n\n(3) The determination of the maximum number of helicopters that can be accommodated at each state airport;\n\n(4) The determination of the extent of emergency services, maintenance, and operations at each state airport; and\n\n(5) An assessment of impact on surrounding areas.\n\n(c) The director shall not make or permit any addition or alteration to any helicopter facilities at any state airport other than those additions or alterations in conformity with the helicopter master plan for that state airport.\n\n(d) The helicopter master plan shall be submitted to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session of 1989, and thereafter shall be formally reviewed every five years.\n\n(e) There is established an advisory committee within each county which shall sit in an advisory capacity to the director on matters relating to the helicopter master plan for each state airport. Each advisory committee shall consist of not more than thirteen members to be appointed by the director and whose membership shall include representatives from the helicopter industry and the communities adjacent to the airport. Each advisory committee shall be placed for administrative purposes only, within the department of transportation. Each member of an advisory committee shall serve without compensation.\n\n(f) For the purposes of this section, \"helicopter operation\" means the operation of a helicopter company from an airport under the State's control.

Upon the department's adoption of a rule providing for the approvals, any person desiring or planning to construct or establish an airport may apply to the department for approval of the site; provided that the application is made before the acquisition of the site or before the construction or establishment of the proposed airport. The department shall issue with reasonable dispatch a certificate granting approval of a site if it is satisfied that:\n\n(1) The site is adequate for the proposed airport;\n\n(2) The proposed airport, if constructed or established, will conform to minimum standards of safety; and\n\n(3) Safe air traffic patterns can be worked out for the proposed airport and for all existing airports and approved airport sites in its vicinity.\n\nAn approval of a site may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions that the department may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section and shall remain in effect, unless sooner revoked by the department, until a license for an airport located on the approved site has been issued pursuant to subsection (b). The department, after notice and opportunity for hearing to a holder of a certificate of approval, may revoke the approval when it shall reasonably determine that there has been an abandonment of the site as an airport site; that there has been a failure within the time prescribed, or if no time was prescribed, within a reasonable time, to develop the site as an airport or to comply with the conditions of the approval; or that because of change of physical or legal conditions or circumstances the site is no longer usable for the aeronautical purposes for which the approval was granted.\n\n(b) Licenses. Except as provided in subsection (d), the department may provide for the licensing of airports and the annual renewal of the licenses. The department may charge license fees not exceeding $100 for each original license, and not exceeding $10 for each renewal thereof. Upon the adoption of a rule providing for the licensing, and upon receipt of an application for an original license and the payment of the duly required fee therefor, the department shall issue with reasonable dispatch an appropriate license if the department is satisfied that the airport conforms to minimum standards of safety and that safe air traffic patterns can be worked out for the airport and for all existing airports and approved airport sites in its vicinity. All licenses shall be renewable annually upon payment of the fees prescribed. Licenses and renewals thereof may be issued subject to any reasonable conditions that the department may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. The department, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the licensee, may revoke any license or renewal thereof, or refuse to issue a renewal, when the department reasonably determines that:\n\n(1) There has been an abandonment of the airport as such;\n\n(2) There has been a failure to comply with the conditions of the license or renewal thereof; or\n\n(3) Because of change of physical or legal conditions or circumstances, the airport has become either unsafe or unusable for the aeronautical purposes for which the license or renewal was issued.\n\nIt shall be unlawful for any person to operate an airport without an appropriate license, as may be duly required by rule adopted pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(c) Public hearings. In connection with the grant of approval of a proposed airport site or the issuance of an airport license under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the department may, on its own motion or upon the request of an affected or interested person, hold a hearing open to the public, and shall hold a hearing when and as required by section 261-13.\n\n(d) Exemptions. The requirements of this section as to site approvals and licenses shall not apply to airports owned or operated by the United States. The department may, from time to time, to the extent necessary, exempt any other class of airports, pursuant to a reasonable classification or grouping, from any rule or regulation promulgated under this section or from any requirement of such a rule or regulation, if it finds that the application of the rule, regulation, or requirement would be an undue burden on such class and is not required in the interest of public safety.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be a limitation upon or construed as a limitation upon the powers granted in the preceding paragraph to the department with the approval of the director of finance to appoint the trustee, or granted in sections 36-3 and 39-13 and the third sentence of section 39-68 to the director of finance to appoint the trustee or others, as fiscal agents, paying agents, and registrars for the revenue bonds or to authorize and empower the fiscal agents, paying agents, and registrars to perform the functions referred to in that paragraph and sections, it being the intent of this paragraph to confirm that the director of finance as aforesaid may elect not to serve as fiscal agent for the revenue bonds or may elect to limit the functions the director of finance shall perform as the fiscal agent, that the director of finance may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient;\n\n(8) The department may sell the revenue bonds either at public or private sale;\n\n(9) If no trustee shall be appointed to collect, hold, and administer the revenues derived from the special facility for which the revenue bonds are issued, the revenues shall be held in a separate account in the treasury of the State, separate and apart from the airport revenue fund, to be applied solely to the carrying out of the resolution, certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement authorizing or securing the revenue bonds;\n\n(10) If the resolution, certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement shall provide that no revenue bonds issued thereunder shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless certified or authenticated by the trustee for the holders of the revenue bonds, signatures of the officers of the State upon the bonds required by section 39-56 may be facsimiles of their signatures;\n\n(11) Proceeds of the revenue bonds may be used and applied by the department to reimburse the other person to the special facility lease for all preliminary costs and expenses, including architectural and legal costs; and\n\n(12) If the special facility lease shall require the other person to operate, maintain, and repair the special facility which is the subject of the lease, at the other person's expense, the requirement shall constitute compliance by the department with section 39-61(a)(2), and none of the revenues derived by the department from the special facility shall be required to be applied to the purposes of section 39-62(2). Sections 39-62(4), 39-62(5), and 39-62(6) shall not be applicable to the revenues derived from a special facility lease.
