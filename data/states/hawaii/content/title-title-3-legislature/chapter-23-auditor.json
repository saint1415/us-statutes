For purposes of this paragraph, a \"low-income resident of the State\" means an individual who is a resident of the State and:\n\n(A) Is the only member of a family of one and has an income of not more than eighty per cent of the area median income for a family of one; or\n\n(B) Is part of a family with an income of not more than eighty per cent of the area median income for a family of the same size.\n\nThe cost shall be estimated by dividing the annual tax expenditure for the credit, exclusion, or deduction for each calendar year under review by the number of low-income residents of the State in the calendar year. The estimate determined pursuant to this paragraph is intended to display the effect on low-income residents of the State if they directly receive, either through tax reduction or negative tax, the dollars saved by elimination of the credit, exclusion, or deduction.\n\n(c) Based on the review, the auditor shall recommend whether the credit, exclusion, or deduction should be retained without modification, amended, or repealed.\n\nThe auditor may recommend that a credit, exclusion, or deduction be removed from review under sections 23-92 to 23-96.
