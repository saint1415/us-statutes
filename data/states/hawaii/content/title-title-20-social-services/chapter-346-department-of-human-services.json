To enforce this subsection, the department shall examine each list of inmates within, or newly admitted to, a correctional facility in the State that is submitted to the department by the director of corrections and rehabilitation pursuant to section 353-12.5, regardless of the nature of the offense for which an inmate is incarcerated or the duration of incarceration, to determine whether an inmate is eligible for public assistance under this chapter.\n\n(c) In determining the needs of an applicant or recipient for public assistance by the department, the department shall:\n\n(1) Disregard the amounts of earned or unearned income as required or allowed by federal acts and other regulations, to receive federal funds and disregard from gross earned income twenty per cent plus $200 and a percentage of the remaining balance of earned income consistent with federal regulations and other requirements;\n\n(2) Consider as net income in all cases the income as federal acts and other regulations require the department to consider for receipt of federal funds and may consider the additional income and resources as these acts and regulations permit to be considered;\n\n(3) For households with minor dependents, disregard assets in determining the needs of persons for financial assistance; provided that the amount to be disregarded shall not exceed standards under federally funded financial assistance programs. This paragraph shall not apply to persons eligible for federal supplemental security income benefits, aid to the aged, blind or disabled, or general assistance to households without minor dependents. In determining the needs of persons eligible for federal supplemental security income benefits, aid to the aged, blind or disabled, or general assistance to households without minor dependents, the department shall apply all the resource retention and exclusion requirements under the federal supplemental security income program;\n\n(4) Apply the resource retention requirements under the federal supplemental security income program in determining the needs of a single person for medical assistance only;\n\n(5) Apply the resource retention requirements under the federal supplemental security income program in determining the needs of a family of two persons for medical assistance only and an additional $250 for each additional person included in an application for medical assistance only;\n\n(6) Disregard amounts of emergency assistance granted under section 346-65;\n\n(7) Not consider as income or resources any payment for services to or on behalf of, or any benefit received by, a participant under the first-to-work program of part XI, other than wages. Wages earned by a participant while participating in the first-to-work program shall be considered income of the participant, unless the wages are excluded or disregarded under any other law;\n\n(8) Not consider as income or resources payment made to eligible individuals, eligible surviving spouses, surviving children or surviving parents as specified under title I of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, Public Law 100-383, which made restitution to individuals of Japanese ancestry who were interned during World War II;\n\n(9) Allow the community spouse of an individual residing in a medical institution to maintain countable resources to the maximum allowed by federal statutes or regulations with provisions for increases, as allowed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services by means of indexing, court order, or fair hearing decree, without jeopardizing the eligibility of the institutionalized spouse for medical assistance;\n\n(10) Allow an individual residing in a medical institution to contribute toward the support of the individual's community spouse, thereby enabling the community spouse to maintain the monthly maximum income allowed by federal statutes or regulations, with provisions for increases as allowed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services by means of indexing, court order, or fair hearing decree;\n\n(11) Consider the transfer of assets from the applicant's name to another name within the specified time period as required by federal regulations, known as the \"lookback\" period, prior to the application for medical assistance for care in a nursing home or other long-term care facility. Pursuant to rules adopted under chapter 91, the director may attribute any assets that have been transferred within the required federal \"lookback\" period from the applicant if the director determines that transfer of certain assets was made solely to make the applicant eligible for assistance under this chapter; and\n\n(12) Not consider as income or resources any funds deposited into a family self-sufficiency escrow account on behalf of a participant under a federal housing choice voucher family self-sufficiency program as required or allowed under federal law.\n\n(d) In determining eligibility for medical assistance, the department shall require from all applicants and recipients the assignment of any benefits due to a third party liability. Any rights or amounts so assigned shall be applied against the cost of medical care paid under this chapter.\n\n(e) The director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 defining assets and to determine eligibility for medical assistance; provided that the cash surrender value of life insurance policies owned by persons included in an application shall be treated as assets.

The written notice of lien shall be accompanied by an itemized list of payments made by the department that identifies the provider of services, the dates of services, the amounts billed and paid, and the dates of payments, and shall be provided to the person against whom restitution is sought. Absent a good faith basis contesting the amount or validity of a specific line item charge or charges in the lien, the entire lien amount shall be presumed to be valid. There is a rebuttable presumption that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged from the facility and return home if the recipient or a representative of the recipient declares that there is no intent to return home or if the recipient has been institutionalized for six months or longer without a discharge plan.\n\n(1) The department may not place a lien on the recipient's home if the recipient's:\n\n(A) Spouse;\n\n(B) Minor, blind, or disabled child; or\n\n(C) Sibling who has an equity interest in the home and who was residing in the home for a period of at least one year immediately before the date of the recipient's admission to the medical institution;\n\nis lawfully residing in the home.\n\n(2) The department shall not recover funds from the lien on the recipient's home when:\n\n(A) A sibling who was residing in the home for a period of at least one year immediately before the date of the recipient's admission to the medical institution; or\n\n(B) A son or daughter who was residing in the recipient's home for a period of at least two years immediately before the date of the recipient's admission to the medical institution, and who establishes to the satisfaction of the State that he or she provided care to the recipient that permitted the recipient to reside at home rather than in an institution;\n\nlawfully resides in the home and has lawfully resided in the home on a continuous basis since the date of the recipient's admission to the medical institution.\n\n(3) The department also shall not recover funds from the lien if the recipient has a surviving spouse; or surviving minor, blind, or disabled child.\n\n(4) Any lien imposed with respect to this subsection shall be dissolved upon the individual's discharge from the medical institution and return home.\n\n(c) The agreement in subsection (a) or the lien in subsection (b) shall be recorded in the bureau of conveyances, or filed in the office of the assistant registrar of the land court. When the agreement or lien is recorded in the bureau of conveyances, the registrar shall forthwith cause the same to be indexed in the general indexes of the bureau of conveyances. From and after the recording in the bureau of conveyances the liens shall attach to all interests in real property then owned by the person and not registered in the land court, and from and after the filing thereof in the office of the assistant registrar of the land court, the liens shall attach to any such interest in land then registered therein. The liens shall be for all amounts of assistance, unless otherwise provided by rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91, then or thereafter paid in accordance with the programs from which the person receives assistance. The department shall be obligated to annually update, as an accounting measure, the actual amount of the liens recorded in the bureau of conveyances.\n\n(d) The department shall issue certificates of release or partial release upon satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the liens. Certificates of release or partial release of any real property lien issued by the director or the director's authorized representative shall be recorded in the bureau of conveyances. The director shall consider issuing conditional certificates of release in cases of extreme hardship as set out in rules adopted under chapter 91. The registrar shall forthwith cause the same to be indexed in the general indexes in a like manner as the original liens. No fee shall be charged for any of the recording. The liens herein provided for shall take priority over any other lien subsequently acquired or recorded except tax liens and except that, in the estate of a beneficiary, the actual funeral expenses, the expenses of the last sickness, the cost of administration of the estate, and any allowance made to the surviving spouse and children for their support during administration of the estate, shall have priority and preference over the liens herein imposed, and over any claim against an estate filed under section 346-37.\n\nThe liens shall be enforceable by the department by suit in the appropriate court or shall be enforceable as a claim against the estate of the recipient under section 346-37, having priority over all other debts except taxes, the actual funeral expenses, the expenses of last sickness, the cost of administration of the estate, and any allowance made to the surviving spouse and children for their support during administration of the estate.\n\nThe liens shall be enforceable as a claim under section 346-37 against the estate of a recipient under any circumstances if the estate is admitted to probate at the instance of any interested party.\n\nWhenever the department is satisfied that the collection of the amount of assistance paid a recipient will not be jeopardized or that the release or waiver of the priority of the liens against the recipient's property, in whole or in part, is necessary to provide for the maintenance or support of the recipient, the recipient's spouse, or any minor or incapacitated child, it may release or waive the priority of the liens with respect to all or any part of the real property.\n\nThe recipient, the recipient's heirs, personal representatives, or assigns may discharge the liens at any time by paying the amount thereof to the department which shall execute a satisfaction thereof. The department may at its discretion compromise the collection of any such liens, but such compromise shall be made only when the recipient, the recipient's heirs, personal representatives, or assigns prove that the collection of the full amount of the liens or claim would cause undue hardship or the liens or claim are otherwise uncollectible.\n\nThe proceeds from the enforcement, payment, or compromise of the liens shall be paid into the treasury of the State. If the amount of assistance reflected by the proceeds was paid in part by federal funds, the proper portion of these funds shall be paid by the director of finance to the treasury of the United States. The director of finance shall thereupon report such payment to the department. If the federal funds are not paid directly into the treasury of the United States, these federal funds shall be credited by the director of finance to the department for expenditure for assistance without need for further appropriation.\n\nIf at any time the federal government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, requires, as a condition to any grant of assistance, the performance of conditions inconsistent with this section, or desisting from actions provided by this section, the governor may suspend, upon a finding to that effect and to the extent of such requirement, any provisions of this section to the end that such federal assistance may be received.\n\nThe department shall submit an annual report to the legislature, which shall include a list of liens held by the department on real property.

      "text": "§346-37 Recovery of payments and costs of medical assistance.(a) If a recipient under this chapter dies leaving an estate and does not have a surviving spouse, child, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, grandchild, stepfather, stepmother, or any designated heir, the department shall have a valid claim against the estate for the amount of social services overpayments, financial assistance overpayments, or burial payments granted. The department shall file a claim against the estate of a deceased recipient of medical assistance for the amount of medical assistance granted, only if the recipient was age fifty-five or over when such medical assistance was received and there is no surviving spouse, or surviving child who is under twenty-one years of age, or blind, or disabled. The department shall file a claim against the estate of a recipient of medical assistance who was an inpatient in a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities, or other medical institution only if there is no surviving spouse or surviving child who is under twenty-one years of age, or blind, or disabled.\n\n(b) If any portion of any public assistance, including medical assistance, food stamps, or burial payment, was obtained by any fraudulent device, including but not limited to those under section 346-34, or if any public assistance, including medical assistance, food stamps, or burial payment, was furnished or provided after receipt of income or resources which were not reported to the department as required by this chapter or by the department, the department may file a claim against the estate of the deceased recipient notwithstanding subsection (a).\n\n(c) If the department has provided medical assistance or burial payment to a person who was injured, suffered a disease, or died under circumstances creating a tort or other liability or payment obligation against a third person, the department shall have a right to recover from the third person an amount not to exceed the full amount of the costs of medical assistance or burial payment furnished or to be furnished by the department.\n\n(d) The department, as to this right of reimbursement, shall also be subrogated to all rights or claims that a claimant has against the third person for medical assistance and burial payments not to exceed the full extent of the costs of medical assistance or burial payment furnished or to be furnished by the department.\n\nTo enforce its rights, the department may intervene or join in any action or proceeding brought by a claimant against the third person. If the action or proceeding is not commenced within six months after the first day on which medical assistance or burial payment is furnished by the department in connection with the injury, disease, or death involved, the department may institute and prosecute legal proceedings against the third person for the injury, disease, or death, in a state court, either alone (in its own name or in the name of a claimant) or in conjunction with the claimant.\n\n(e) An attorney representing a claimant or third person shall make reasonable inquiry as to whether the claimant has received or is receiving from the department medical assistance related to the incident involved in the action. If the claimant, claimant's attorney, or claimant's heirs, representatives, or beneficiaries, or any third person have received from the department actual notice of its right to reimbursement or if they have reason to know that the claimant has received or is receiving from the department medical assistance related to the incident, then the claimant, claimant's attorney, claimant's heirs, representatives, or beneficiaries, or third person or third person's attorney shall give to the department timely written notice of any claim or action against a third person. At any time during the pendency of any claim or action, the claimant, claimant's attorney if represented, claimant's heirs, representatives, or beneficiaries, or third person or third person's attorney may contact the department to ascertain the full amount of the costs of medical assistance or burial payment made, which information shall be provided in a reasonable time by the department. Upon obtaining a judgment or reaching a settlement through negotiation or legal proceedings, but before the release of any award or settlement proceeds to any person:\n\n(1) The claimant's attorney or third person or third person's attorney, if the attorney has received actual notice from the department of a lien or if the attorney or third person has reason to know that a lien exists; or\n\n(2) The claimant or the claimant's heirs, representatives, or beneficiaries, if not represented by an attorney who has received actual notice of the lien,\n\nshall notify the department immediately in order to ascertain and satisfy the department's right to reimbursement for costs of medical assistance or burial payment made.\n\n(f) If liability is found to exist, or if the issue of third-party liability is settled or compromised without a finding of liability, regardless of who institutes legal proceedings or seeks other means of recovering, the department shall have a right to recover up to the full amount of the costs of medical assistance or burial payment made from a settlement, award, or judgment. To aid in the recovery of the costs, the department shall have a first lien for up to the full amount of the costs of medical assistance or burial payment made against the proceeds from damages recovered in a settlement, award, or judgment. The lien shall attach as provided by subsection (g).\n\n(g) The lien of the department for reimbursement of costs of medical assistance or burial payments under subsection (f), shall attach by a written notice of lien served upon the claimant's attorney or upon the third person, the third person's agent, attorney, or insurance company. The method of service shall be by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by delivery of the notice of lien personally to these individuals. Service by certified or registered mail is complete upon receipt. The notice of lien shall state the name of the injured, diseased, or deceased person, the amount of the lien, and the date of the accident or incident that caused the injuries, disease, or death that necessitated the department's medical assistance or burial payments. If the notice of lien is served upon the claimant's attorney, the notice of lien shall state that the claimant's attorney shall pay the lien from the proceeds of any judgment, settlement, or compromise based on the incident or accident as provided in this section. If the notice of lien is served upon the third person, or the third person's agent, attorney, or insurance company, the notice of lien shall state that the third person shall pay the lien as provided in this section prior to disbursing any of the proceeds to the claimant or to the claimant's attorney. A notice of lien may be amended from time to time until extinguished, each amendment taking effect upon proper service.\n\nWhen restitution is sought in a criminal proceeding from a third person who has caused injury to a recipient of medical assistance, a written notice of lien and an itemized list of payments made by the department that identifies the provider of services, the dates of services, the amounts billed and paid, and the dates of payments, shall be provided to the court and to the person against whom restitution is sought. Absent a good faith basis contesting the amount or validity of a specific line item charge or charges in the lien, the entire lien amount shall be presumed valid by the court in determining the amount of restitution pursuant to section 706-646.\n\n(h) The lien shall attach as provided by subsection (g). If a notice of lien is properly served upon the attorney representing the claimant as provided in subsection (g), that attorney shall pay the lien as provided in this section prior to disbursing any of the proceeds of the suit or settlement to the attorney's client. If a notice of lien is properly served upon the third person, the third person's agent or attorney, or the third person's insurance company, as provided in subsection (g), it shall be the responsibility of the person receiving the notices to pay the lien as provided in this section prior to disbursing any of the proceeds to the claimant's attorney. The lien shall be satisfied from that portion of the settlement, award, or judgment allocated or allocable to payments by the department for medical assistance and burial payments. Any allocation by a judge, jury, arbitrator, or similar dispute resolution person or tribunal shall be binding; provided that the department's medical assistance and burial payments are included as part of the case or claims brought by the claimant in any action. Any allocation by the claimant or third party may be considered but is not binding on the department. If there is no allocation, a reasonable allocation shall be determined by agreement, administrative hearing under subsection (i), or a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nIf, after having received timely written notice of any claim or action under subsection (e), the department did not intervene or join in the action or prosecute its own claims or actively participate with claimant or claimant's attorney in the prosecution of claims, or a distribution agreement was not entered into between the parties, reimbursement shall be as follows: If the lien is less than or equal to one-third of the settlement, award, or judgment, and there is no allocation by a judge, jury, arbitrator, or similar dispute resolution person or tribunal, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount of reimbursement due the department is the total payments for medical assistance or burial payments by the department or one-third of the settlement, award, or judgment, whichever is less. Any party challenging this rebuttable presumption shall bear the burden of proof. The department's fair share of claimant's reasonable attorney's fees and expenses shall be deducted from the department's lien recovery. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that one-third of the department's gross reimbursement amount plus a proportionate share of the general excise tax is a reasonable amount for the department's contribution towards claimant's attorney's fees and expenses. Any party challenging this rebuttable presumption shall bear the burden of proof.\n\nIf the department alone prosecutes claims that include its medical assistance or burial payments, it shall not be required to reduce its lien on account of attorney's fees or expenses, if any, incurred by the claimant or claimant's attorney.\n\nIf the claimant's attorney and the department contribute to the recovery of medical assistance or burial payments made by the department, then the department's fair contribution toward the claimant's attorney's fees and costs incurred shall be a reasonable amount based solely upon legitimate costs and services rendered by the claimant or claimant's attorney in recovering the lien amount. Any dispute regarding the department's determination of its contribution to claimant's attorney's fees and costs may be submitted to administrative hearing under subsection (i) or a court of competent jurisdiction. The value of services contributed by the claimant and department may be considered in fairly allocating fees and costs between the claimant and department where both contribute to recovering the lien amount.\n\nThe department's lien, after reduction for its contribution to claimant's attorney's fees and expenses, shall not exceed one-third of the settlement, award, or judgment. Payment of one-third of the settlement, award, or judgment to the department and two-thirds to the claimant and claimant's attorney shall satisfy the entire lien if the department's lien, after reduction for its contribution to claimant's attorney's fees and expenses, exceeds one-third of the settlement, award, or judgment. Any claimant who asserts that reimbursement to the department should be less than one-third of the settlement, award, or judgment, under the circumstances of that claim, shall bear the burden of proof.\n\n(i) If there is a dispute between the claimant, the claimant's agent or the claimant's attorney, and the department concerning the existence of the lien or the amount of the lien, or the amount to be reimbursed, the claimant, the claimant's agent, or the claimant's attorney may submit the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction or request in writing an administrative hearing on the dispute. After receipt by the department of a written request, the department shall conduct an administrative hearing within a reasonable period of time. Chapter 91, including any provisions for judicial review or appeal, shall apply to the hearing. Funds sufficient to fully satisfy the reimbursement rights of the department shall be either retained by the person served with the notice of lien, shall be paid to the department, or otherwise reserved subject to agreement with the department pending a decision by the court or the department and any subsequent judicial review or appeal.\n\n(j) Upon the recovery of any claim as provided in this section, the amount recovered shall be paid into the treasury of the State, and if the amount for which claim was paid was in part from federal funds, the proper portion thereof shall be paid by the director of finance into the treasury of the United States, and the director of finance shall report the payment to the department.\n\n(k) Any person who is subject to the lien who fails to pay the full amount due under this section to the department for reimbursement of the costs of medical assistance, although able to do so from the proceeds of the suit or settlement, shall be personally liable to the department for any damage proximately caused to the department by the failure.\n\n(l) No action taken by the department in connection with the rights under this section shall deny to the claimant the recovery for that portion of the claimant's damages not covered under this section.\n\n(m) For purposes of this section:\n\n\"Claimant\" includes an injured or diseased person, the person's guardian, or the personal representative, estate, dependents, or survivors, of the deceased person.\n\n\"Costs of medical assistance\" furnished or to be furnished by the department includes:\n\n(1) The value or cost of medical care services provided directly by the department;\n\n(2) The amount paid by the department to a provider for medical care services rendered or to be rendered; and\n\n(3) The value or cost of medical care services rendered or to be rendered by a provider that has received the equivalent of an insurance benefit, capitation rate, and other fee or like charge paid by the department or by a medical care insurer to provide for medical care services.\n\n\"Third person\" includes any person, business, corporation, partnership, or entity of any kind or nature, including employers and insurance carriers, that is potentially liable to the claimant for any tort, liability, payment, reimbursement, or benefit of any kind or nature by reason of any injury, disease, or death.\n\n(n) The department may agree with a provider or medical care insurer for the provision of medical care services or medical assistance to any claimant, and the agreement may provide for the department to be the exclusive entity authorized to recover all costs of medical assistance rendered to a claimant. The department may recover all costs through the use of the lien procedures established by this section.\n\n(o) In third-party liability situations, the medical assistance program of the department shall be fully reimbursed the amount due under this section or funds sufficient to fully reimburse the department the amount due under this section shall be retained by the person served with the notice of lien or otherwise reserved in a manner agreeable to the department before the claimant receives any money from the settlement or award. This section is not intended to restrict or diminish the right of the department to settle or compromise its reimbursement rights under this section for less than the full amount due or enter into any agreement with claimant, claimant's attorney or representative, or other party for the distribution of proceeds from a suit or settlement.

For other work eligible households and non-work eligible households and households in which all caretaker relatives are minors, living independently with minor dependents and attending school, the assistance allowance shall be set no higher than sixty-two and one-half per cent and no lower than forty-four per cent of the standard of need. For all other households, the assistance allowance shall be set no higher than sixty-two and one-half per cent of the standard of need and set no lower than thirty-four per cent of the standard of need. The standard of need shall be determined by dividing the 2006 federal poverty level by twelve and rounding down the quotient. The remaining quotient shall be multiplied by the per cent as set by the director by rules pursuant to chapter 91, and the final product shall be rounded down to determine the assistance allowance; provided that:\n\n(1) The department may increase or reduce the assistance allowance as determined in this subsection for work eligible households for the purpose of providing work incentives or services under part XI;\n\n(2) No reduction shall be allowed that jeopardizes eligibility for or receipt of federal funds;\n\n(3) Reductions in the assistance allowance shall be limited to no more than one per year; and\n\n(4) No work eligible household, which includes an adult who has received sixty cumulative months of temporary assistance to needy families with minor dependents, shall be eligible for an assistance allowance, unless authorized by federal regulations.\n\n(b) The director shall determine the allowance for general assistance to households without minor dependents based upon the total amount appropriated for general assistance to households without minor dependents, among other relevant factors.\n\n(c) The director, pursuant to chapter 91, shall determine the rate of payment for domiciliary care, including care provided in licensed developmental disabilities domiciliary homes, community care foster family homes, and certified adult foster homes, to be provided to recipients who are eligible for federal supplementary security income or public assistance, or both. The director shall provide for level of care payment as follows:\n\n(1) Beginning on July 1, 2008, for adult residential care homes classified as facility type I, licensed developmental disabilities domiciliary homes as defined under section 321-15.9, community care foster family homes as defined under section 321-481, and certified adult foster homes as defined under section 321-11.2, the state supplemental payment shall not exceed $651.90; and\n\n(2) Beginning on July 1, 2008, for adult residential care homes classified as facility type II, the state supplemental payment shall not exceed $759.90.\n\nIf the operator does not provide the quality of care consistent with the needs of the individual to the satisfaction of the department, the department may remove the recipient to another facility.\n\nThe department shall handle abusive practices under this section in accordance with chapter 91.\n\nNothing in this subsection shall allow the director to remove a recipient from an adult residential care home or other similar institution if the recipient does not desire to be removed and the operator is agreeable to the recipient remaining, except where the recipient requires a higher level of care than provided or where the recipient no longer requires any domiciliary care.\n\n(d) On July 1, 2006, and thereafter, as the department determines a need, the department shall authorize a payment, as allowed by federal law, for resident clients receiving supplemental security income in adult residential care home type I and type II facilities, licensed developmental disabilities domiciliary homes as defined under section 321-15.9, community care foster family homes as defined under section 321-481, and certified adult foster homes as defined under section 321-11.2, when state funds appropriated for the purpose of providing payments under subsection (c) for a specific fiscal year are not expended fully within a period that meets the requirements of the department's maintenance of effort agreement with the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe payment shall be made with that portion of state funds identified in this subsection that has not been expended.\n\nThe department shall determine the rate of payment to ensure compliance with its maintenance of effort agreement with the Social Security Administration.\n\n(e) The department shall pay rental and utility (to include gas, electricity, and water only) deposits once only for any person eligible for financial assistance by the department. However, under extraordinary circumstances as determined by the department, an additional rental deposit, utility deposit, or both, may be granted.\n\n(f) Any recipient may petition the department for additional assistance when the recipient's need is due to emergencies caused by seismic wave, tsunami, hurricane, volcanic eruption, typhoon, earthquake, flood, or fire determined by the director to have caused losses as to require and justify additional assistance from the State. In addition, any recipient may petition the department for additional assistance for the replacement or repair of household appliances. The additional assistance shall be paid on an emergency basis, as determined by the department, to meet the cost of replacing or repairing household appliances. If the cost of repairs of household appliances is less than one-half the unit cost of the item, the department shall pay for the cost of repairs. If the cost of repairs of household appliances is one-half the unit cost of the item or more, the department shall replace the household appliance; provided that the replacement cost shall not exceed $350. For the purposes of this subsection, \"household appliances\" means a refrigerator or a range.\n\nThe department shall establish an emergency fund, not to exceed one per cent of total financial assistance from state funds required by this chapter in the previous fiscal year. The director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 for determining in which cases to grant lump sum payments to recipients petitioning for additional assistance.\n\n(g) The department shall include protective child care payment as a special needs item in the financial assistance standard for cases of child neglect or abuse requiring placement of a child in child care. The referral for protective child care payment shall be from the department's child welfare program and the rate of payment shall be set by the department.\n\n(h) The director shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to implement this section.

The proposed projected adjusted rate shall be calculated based on a consolidated basis where the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic takes all costs for the center that would include both the costs included in the base rate, as well as the additional costs, provided that the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic calculated the baseline prospective payment system rate based on total consolidated costs. A net change in the federally qualified health center's or rural health clinic's rate shall be calculated by subtracting the federally qualified health center's or rural health clinic's previously assigned prospective payment system rate from its projected adjusted rate.\n\n(c) Within one hundred twenty days of its receipt of the projected adjusted rate and all additional documentation requested by the department, the department shall notify the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic of its acceptance or rejection of the projected adjusted rate.

For those federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics in which the change of scope of services is in effect for six months or less of the cost report fiscal year, review of the next full fiscal year cost report also is required.

For federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics that filed consolidated cost reports for multiple sites to establish their baseline prospective payment system rates, the net change of three per cent shall be applied to the average per visit rate of all the sites of the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic for purposes of calculating the costs associated with a scope of service change. For the purposes of this section, \"net change\" means the per visit change attributable to the cumulative effect of all increases or decreases for a particular fiscal year.\n\n(h) All references in this section to \"fiscal year\" shall be construed to be references to the fiscal year of the individual federally qualified health center or rural health clinic, as the case may be.

The failure of any adult member of the assistance unit to comply with the requirements or conditions of general assistance to households without minor dependents shall exclude the entire assistance unit from receiving financial assistance. However, when the adult member is disqualified for not meeting the work requirement, the assistance unit shall not be disqualified if the assistance unit was formed after the failure to meet the work requirement occurred. \"Assistance unit\" as the term is used in this section means persons whose needs, income, and assets are considered in the financial assistance payment and their dependents.\n\nFor purposes of determining whether persons seeking assistance are bona fide residents of this State, the department of human services shall consider, but is not limited to considering, the following factors:\n\n(1) Enrollment and receipt of welfare benefits from another jurisdiction;\n\n(2) Physical presence in the State;\n\n(3) Maintenance of a place of residence in the State;\n\n(4) The availability of furnishings and household and personal effects sufficient to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the place of residence is more than a public accommodation;\n\n(5) Qualification as to residence for purposes of voting in the State;\n\n(6) Change in vehicle operation license;\n\n(7) Vehicle registration;\n\n(8) Enrollment of children in local schools; and\n\n(9) Bank accounts in this State or any other jurisdiction.\n\n(b) A person between eighteen and sixty-five years of age with a disability shall be eligible for general assistance to households without minor dependents if the person:\n\n(1) Is determined to be needy in accordance with standards established by this chapter and the rules adopted under subsection (e);\n\n(2) Is unable to meet the disability requirements established by the federal supplemental security income program or its successor agency; and\n\n(3) Is unable to engage in any substantial gainful employment because of a determined and certified physical, mental, or combination of physical and mental disability. Upon application, the department shall ask the person whether the person has a physical or mental disability, or both. If the person claims to have both a physical and mental disability, the department shall ask the person to choose whether the person's primary disability is physical or mental. Determination and certification of the disability shall be as follows:\n\n(A) A determination and certification of physical disability shall be made by a board of licensed physicians designated and paid by the department. Meetings of this board shall not be subject to part I of chapter 92;\n\n(B) A determination and certification of mental disability shall be made by a board of licensed psychologists or licensed physicians whose specialty is in psychiatry. This board shall be designated and paid by the department. Meetings of this board shall not be subject to part I of chapter 92;\n\n(C) If a determination and certification is made that the applicant does not have a physical, mental, or combination of a physical and mental disability, prior to a denial of any claim, the department shall provide the applicant with an initial denial notice that gives the applicant at least ten calendar days to provide additional medical evidence. The notice shall refer the applicant to free legal services for assistance and permit the applicant to request extensions of time, if necessary;\n\n(D) If a determination of physical, mental, or combination of a physical and mental disability is made, the person shall accept and pursue appropriate medical treatment from a provider of the person's choice. The department shall promptly provide the person with a complete and legible copy of the recommended appropriate treatment;\n\n(E) Any person, to continue to be certified as mentally disabled, physically disabled, or both mentally and physically disabled, shall be reevaluated annually, as provided by this section, and more frequently, as required by the department; and\n\n(F) Failure to pursue appropriate medical treatment shall result in a loss of eligibility, unless the failure is due to good cause. Good cause shall include but not be limited to:\n\n(i) Treatment is unavailable;\n\n(ii) Personal emergencies; and\n\n(iii) Circumstances that threaten the safety of the patient.\n\nThe department shall adopt rules in accordance with chapter 91 to define \"good cause\", as used in subparagraph (F), in order to determine when treatment is unavailable, what constitutes a personal emergency, what circumstances may threaten the safety of a patient, and other factors that may constitute good cause.\n\nAs used in this subsection:\n\n\"Substantial gainful employment\" means at least thirty hours of work per week.\n\n\"With a disability\" or \"having a disability\" means a disability that extends for a period of over sixty days.\n\nAny person determined to be eligible under this subsection may be referred to any appropriate state agency for vocational rehabilitation services and shall be required to accept the services as a further condition of eligibility for the receipt of general assistance to households without minor dependents under this section. An assistance unit shall be determined ineligible for general assistance to households without minor dependents if any adult member of the assistance unit fails to cooperate with any appropriate state agency for vocational rehabilitation services after being referred for services. Any person found eligible under this subsection may also be required to seek employment and participate in public work projects, as described in section 346-31, and in public employment projects, as described in section 346-102.\n\n(c) Applicants and recipients shall be required to satisfy all applicable provisions of this section. Recipients disqualified for failure to comply with any of the requirements under this section shall be excluded from general assistance to households without minor dependents for a period not to exceed twelve months.\n\n(d) The allowance for general assistance to households without minor dependents shall not exceed sixty-two and one-half per cent of the standard of need.\n\n(e) Within the limitations of this section, the department shall by rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91, determine:\n\n(1) The allowance for general assistance to households without minor dependents based upon the total amount appropriated for general assistance to households without minor dependents;\n\n(2) A method for determining assistance amounts; and\n\n(3) Other necessary provisions to implement general assistance to households without minor dependents.

Public service employment will also assist the department of human services in determining whether a general assistance recipient should be eligible for public assistance for refusal to participate without a justifiable reason.

The condition of a seriously ill patient suffering from the human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or hepatitis C, or who is in need of transplant immunosuppressives, will generally not remain stable for long without prompt treatment. If these persons are not more promptly and effectively treated, a significant probability exists that there will be a substantial increase in health care costs and hospitalizations, thereby increasing medical costs to the State.
