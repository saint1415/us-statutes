L 2023, c 107, §8.]Treatment recommendations made via telehealth, including issuing a prescription via electronic means, shall be held to the same standards of appropriate practice as those in traditional physician-patient settings that do not include [an] in-person visit but in which prescribing is appropriate, including on-call telephone encounters and encounters for which a follow-up visit is arranged. Issuing a prescription based solely on an online questionnaire is not treatment for the purposes of this section and does not constitute an acceptable standard of care. For the purposes of prescribing opiates or certifying a patient for the medical use of cannabis, a physician-patient relationship shall only be established after an in-person consultation between the prescribing physician and the patient.\n\n(d) All medical reports resulting from telehealth services are part of a patient's health record and shall be made available to the patient. Patient medical records shall be maintained in compliance with all applicable state and federal requirements including privacy requirements.\n\n(e) A physician-patient relationship may be established via a telehealth interaction; provided that the physician has a license to practice medicine in the State.\n\n(f) Once a physician-patient relationship is established, a patient or physician licensed in this State may use telehealth for any authorized purpose, including consultation with a medical provider licensed in another state, authorized by this section or as otherwise provided by law.\n\n(g) The physician-patient relationship prerequisite under this section shall not apply to telehealth consultations for emergency department services.\n\n(h)[Repeal and reenactment on December 31, 2025. L 2023, c 107, §8.]Unless otherwise provided by law, reimbursement for behavioral health services provided through telehealth via an interactive telecommunications system shall be equivalent to reimbursement for the same services provided via in-person contact between a health care provider and a patient; provided that reimbursement for two-way, real-time audio-only communication technology for purposes of diagnosis, evaluation, or treatment of a mental health disorder to a patient in the patient's home shall be equivalent to eighty per cent of the reimbursement for the same services provided via in-person contact between a health care provider and a patient. To be reimbursed for telehealth via an interactive telecommunications system using two-way, real-time audio-only communication technology in accordance with this subsection, the health care provider shall first conduct an in-person visit or a telehealth visit that is not audio only, within six months prior to the initial audio-only visit, or within twelve months prior to any subsequent audio-only visit. The telehealth visit required prior to the initial or subsequent audio-only visit in this subsection shall not be provided using audio-only communication.\n\n(i) Services provided by telehealth pursuant to this chapter shall be consistent with all federal and state privacy, security, and confidentiality laws.\n\n(j)[Repeal and reenactment on December 31, 2025.

A person who is trained to do only a very limited number of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures under the direction of a physician or osteopathic physician shall not be deemed a practitioner of medicine or osteopathy and therefore does not require licensure under this section.\n\n(b) The board shall establish medical educational and training standards with which a person applying for licensure as a physician assistant shall comply. The standards shall be at least equal to recognized national education and training standards for physician assistants.\n\n(c) Upon satisfactory proof of compliance with the required medical educational and training standards, the board may grant state licensure to a person who has been granted certification based upon passage of a national certifying examination and who holds a current certificate from the national certifying entity approved by the board.\n\n(d) The board shall approve temporary licensure of an applicant under this section. The applicant shall have graduated from a board approved training program within twelve months of the date of application and never taken a national certifying examination approved by the board but otherwise meets the requirements of this section.

A physician or osteopathic physician who does not supervise a physician assistant's services at the degree required by the board shall be deemed to have engaged in professional misconduct.\n\n(g) For medical records of patients seen by physician assistants:\n\n(1) Each physician assistant and supervising physician, osteopathic physician, or group of physicians shall establish written guidelines for the review of medical records as appropriate to the specific practice.

Failure to apply for renewal shall constitute a forfeiture of the license that may only be restored upon written application for restoration and payment to the board of a restoration fee.\n\n(k) Beginning with the renewal for the licensing biennium commencing February 1, 2020, and every biennial renewal thereafter, a physician assistant shall be in compliance with continuing medical education requirements by obtaining forty credit hours in:\n\n(1) A category 1 continuing medical education program accredited by the American Medical Association;\n\n(2) A category 1A continuing medical education program accredited by the American Osteopathic Association; or\n\n(3) A category 1 continuing medical education program accredited by the American Academy of Physician Assistants.\n\n(l) To determine compliance with the continuing medical education requirements under subsection (k), the board may conduct random audits of physician assistants' continuing education documentation.
