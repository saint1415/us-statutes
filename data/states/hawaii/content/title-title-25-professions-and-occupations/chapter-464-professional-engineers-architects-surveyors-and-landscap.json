At least one month in advance of the date of expiration of the license, a notice shall be mailed to every person licensed under this section informing them of the date of expiration and the amount required for the renewal. Licenses that have expired for failure to pay renewal fees on or before the date required in this subsection may be restored within two years of the expiration date upon payment of a fee for each renewal. Any person who fails to restore the person's license within two years of the date of its expiration shall reapply for licensure as a new applicant and meet the requirements in effect at that time.\n\n(d) The board shall require continuing education to renew a license for architects effective as of the renewal date for a license expiring on April 30, 2008, and for every biennial renewal period thereafter.

After the two-year restoration period, the licensee shall be required to apply as a new applicant, and meet the requirements in effect at that time; and\n\n(6) An architect licensee shall not be subject to the continuing education requirement if the architect otherwise meets all other renewal requirements and:\n\n(A) Is a member of the armed forces, National Guard, or a reserve component on active duty and deployed during a state or national crisis as \"state or national crisis\" is defined in chapter 436B;\n\n(B) Is ill or disabled for a significant period of time as documented by a licensed physician, and is unable to meet the continuing education requirements of this subsection;\n\n(C) Can demonstrate undue hardship that prevented the licensee from meeting the continuing education requirements of this subsection; or\n\n(D) Is retired from the practice of architecture and is no longer performing or providing architectural services;\n\nprovided that any exemption from the continuing education requirements shall be subject to the board's approval.
