The bond shall be conditioned that the cemetery or pre-need funeral authority will faithfully, promptly, and truly account and pay over to all persons to or for whom it may sell, lease, or otherwise deal in cemetery property, pre-need interment, or pre-need funeral services all sums of money that may properly be due them.\n\n(c) In addition to any other remedy, the director or any person claiming to have sustained damage by reason of any breach of the conditions of the bond may bring action on the bond for the recovery of any damages sustained therefrom.

The licensee shall abide by the limitations and conditions set forth in subsection (d) until satisfactory proof of bond coverage is submitted to the director as required by this section. Failure to abide by any of the limitations and conditions set forth in subsection (d) shall result in an automatic fine against the licensee of $1,000 per violation of any limitation or condition. Each day's continuance of a violation may be treated as a separate violation. Within sixty days after receipt of the notification of the imposition of the automatic fine, the licensee may request an administrative hearing to review the automatic fine pursuant to chapter 91.\n\n(f) A licensee on limited and conditional status who fails, refuses, or neglects to submit satisfactory proof of bond coverage as required by this section within a period of one year, unless otherwise modified by the director, shall cause the automatic and immediate suspension of its license. The director shall not reinstate the license until satisfactory proof of bond coverage is submitted to the director. During the period of suspension the licensee is prohibited from acting or assuming to act as a cemetery or pre-need funeral authority except to the extent that it provides perpetual care services or honors the obligations of its pre-need contracts with customers. The licensee shall notify the trustee of the trust of the suspension of its license. The licensee may seek to surrender its license pursuant to section 441-46 or transfer its license pursuant to section 441-30.5.\n\n(g) Failure to effect a reinstatement of a suspended license within sixty days shall cause it to be terminated, thereby forfeiting all license and renewal fees and the rights of the licensee to use the license, and to act as a cemetery or pre-need funeral authority under this chapter. Within sixty days after receipt of the notification of the license termination, the licensee may request an administrative hearing to review the termination pursuant to chapter 91.

The filing of this alternative form of security shall allow the director to reinstate a license which has been placed on a limited and conditional status, suspended, or terminated.
