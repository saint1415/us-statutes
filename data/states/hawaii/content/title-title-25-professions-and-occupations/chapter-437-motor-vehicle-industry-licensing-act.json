As used in this subparagraph, \"good faith\" means the duty of each party to any franchise agreement to fully comply with that agreement, or to act in a fair and equitable manner towards each other;\n\n(D) Has delayed delivery of or refused to deliver without cause, any new motor vehicle to a dealer, franchised to sell the new motor vehicle, within a reasonable time after receipt of a written order for the vehicle from the dealer. The delivery to another dealer of a motor vehicle of the same model and similarly equipped as the vehicle ordered by a dealer who has not received delivery thereof, but who had placed the written order for the vehicle prior to the order of the dealer receiving the vehicle, shall be prima facie evidence of a delayed delivery of, or refusal to deliver, a new motor vehicle without cause. The nondelivery of a new motor vehicle to a dealer within sixty days after receipt of a written order for the vehicle from a dealer shall also be prima facie evidence of delayed delivery of, or refusal to deliver, a new motor vehicle without cause; provided that the delayed delivery of, or refusal to deliver, a motor vehicle shall be deemed with cause if the manufacturer establishes that the delay or refusal to deliver is due to a shortage or curtailment of material, labor, transportation, utility service, labor or production difficulty, or other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of the manufacturer;\n\n(E) Has discriminated against any of their franchised dealers in the State by directly or indirectly charging the dealer more for a new motor vehicle or services, parts, or accessories or a higher rate of transportation for transporting the vehicle from the manufacturing or assembly plant to the dealer or any portion of the distance, than is charged to any other of their franchised dealers in the State for the same make, model, and year of a new motor vehicle or for the same devices, parts, or accessories for the similar transportation for the vehicle during the same period. A manufacturer or distributor who provides or causes to be provided greater transportation benefits for a new motor vehicle as aforesaid to any of their franchised dealers in the State than is provided to any of their competing franchised dealers in the State for the same or lesser price or charge than that imposed upon the franchised dealer in the State during the same period is deemed to have so discriminated against the competing franchised dealer in the State. Evidence of similar discriminatory practice against franchised dealers in other states shall not constitute a defense to or justification of the commission of the discriminatory act against the franchised dealer in the State. The intent and purpose of this subparagraph is to eliminate inequitable pricing policies set by manufacturers or distributors which result in higher prices of new motor vehicles to the consumer in the State. This subparagraph shall be liberally interpreted to effect its intent and purpose and in the application thereof, the substance and effect and not the form of the acts and transactions shall be primarily considered in determining whether a discriminatory act has been committed. Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall prohibit establishing delivered prices or destination charges to dealers in the State which reasonably reflect the seller's total transportation costs incurred in the manufacture or delivery of products to the dealers, including costs that are related to the geographical distances and modes of transportation involved in shipments to this State, or which meet those lower prices established by competitors;\n\n(F) Has required a dealer of new motor vehicles in the State as a condition of sale and delivery of new motor vehicles to purchase special features, appliances, accessories, or equipment not desired or requested by the dealer; provided that this prohibition shall not apply to special features, appliances, accessories, or equipment, except heaters, that are regularly installed on that particular model or new motor vehicles as \"standard\" equipment or to special features, appliances, accessories, or equipment that are an integral part of the new motor vehicles and cannot be removed therefrom without substantial expense. Nothing in this subparagraph shall make it unlawful for a dealer to sell a vehicle that includes a heater that has been installed as standard equipment;\n\n(G) Has failed to adequately and fairly compensate its dealers for labor incurred by the dealer to perform under and comply with manufacturer's warranty agreements. In no event shall any manufacturer or distributor pay its dealers a labor rate per hour for warranty work that is less than that charged by the dealer to the retail customers of the dealer nor shall the rates be more than the retail rates. All claims made by the dealers for compensation for delivery, preparation, and warranty work shall be paid within thirty days after approval and shall be approved or disapproved within thirty days after receipt. When any claim is disapproved, the dealer shall be notified in writing of the grounds for disapproval;\n\n(H) Has wilfully failed to affix the vehicle bumper impact notice pursuant to section 437-4.5(a), or wilfully misstated any information in the notice. Each failure or misstatement is a separate offense;\n\n(I) Has wilfully defaced, or removed the vehicle bumper impact notice required by section 437-4.5(a) prior to delivery of the vehicle to which the notice is required to be affixed to the registered owner or lessee. Each wilful defacement, alteration, or removal is a separate offense; or\n\n(J) Has required a dealer to refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or the acquisition of, any other line of new motor vehicle or related products; provided that the new motor vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit consistent with the requirements of section 437-7(d)(1) for each make or line of new motor vehicle, remains in compliance with reasonable facilities and other franchise requirements of the manufacturer or distributor, and makes no unauthorized change in the principal management of the dealer.\n\n(b) For disregard of an order suspending a license pursuant to section 436B-23, the board may summarily take possession of and impound all motor vehicles belonging to or in the possession of the licensee whether or not the vehicles are situated upon the licensed premises, pending final action in this case or, without taking possession of the motor vehicles, may render them unusable; provided that the right of the board to take any action and any liens for towing or storage or otherwise arising from the action are subject to and subordinate to any security interest that has attached to the motor vehicles prior thereto, and the board, prior to taking any action, shall give notice thereof to any secured party whose security interest in the motor vehicles is known to the board or who, prior to any action by the board, had filed a financing statement covering the motor vehicles or had noted the lien on the legal ownership certificates thereof.\n\n(c) Any fine imposed by the board after a hearing in accordance with chapter 91 shall be no less than $100 nor no more than $1,000 for each violation.\n\n(d) In lieu of or in addition to the fine imposed under this section, the board may require the motor vehicle dealer to make restitution to the customer. Restitution may be imposed in lieu of a fine even though the amount may exceed the fine set forth in subsection (c).

The dealer shall provide the manufacturer or distributor with notice of the proposed address and a reasonable site plan of the proposed location. The manufacturer or distributor shall approve or deny the request in writing no later than sixty days after receipt of the request. Failure to deny the request within sixty days constitutes approval;\n\n(6) Require a dealer to construct, renovate, or make substantial alterations to the dealer's facilities unless the manufacturer or distributor can demonstrate that such construction, renovation, or alteration requirements are reasonable and justifiable based on reasonable business consideration, including current and reasonably foreseeable projections of economic conditions existing in the automotive industry at the time such action would be required of the dealer, and agrees to make a good faith effort to make available, at the dealer's option, a reasonable quantity and mix of new motor vehicles, which, after a reasonable analysis of market conditions, are projected to meet the sales level necessary to support the increased overhead incurred by the dealer as a result of the required construction, renovation, or alteration; provided that a dealer may be required by a manufacturer or distributor to make reasonable facility improvements and technological upgrades necessary to support the technology of the manufacturer's or distributor's vehicles. If the dealer chooses not to make such facility improvements or technological upgrades, the manufacturer or distributor shall not be obligated to provide the dealer with the vehicles which require the improvements or upgrades or any corresponding incentives or benefits. A manufacturer or distributor may not require a dealer to construct, renovate, or make substantial alterations to the dealer's facility if the dealer has completed a construction, renovation, or substantial alteration to the same component of the facility that was required and approved by the manufacturer or distributor within the previous ten years. For purposes of this paragraph, a \"substantial alteration\" means an alteration that has a major impact on the architectural features, characteristics, appearance, or integrity of a structure or lot. The term \"substantial alteration\" does not include routine maintenance, such as painting and repairs reasonably necessary to maintain a dealership facility in attractive condition, or any changes to items protected by federal intellectual property rights. If a dealer has completed facility construction, renovation, or substantial alteration under an incentive program, the manufacturer or distributor may not deny a dealer payment or benefits according to the terms of that program in place when the dealer began to perform under the program. If the incentive program under which the dealer completed a facility construction, renovation, or substantial alteration on or after January 1, 2016, does not contain a specific time period during which the manufacturer or distributor must provide payments or benefits to a dealer, then the manufacturer or distributor may not deny the dealer payment or benefits under the terms of that incentive program, as it existed when the dealer began to perform under the program for the balance of ten years after the manufacturer or distributor made the program available to the dealer, regardless of whether the manufacturer's or distributor's facility program has been changed or canceled. This paragraph shall not be construed to require a manufacturer or distributor to provide payment or benefits if changes have been made to the facility since the manufacturer's or distributor's approval that would render the facility non-compliant, regardless of whether the manufacturer's or distributor's image program has changed. Facility changes that are necessitated due to damage sustained from a natural disaster or as a result of necessary safety upgrades shall not be considered a change to the facility that renders the facility non-compliant; provided that those facility changes substantially restore the facilities to the previous or current compliant state. Eligibility for facility-related incentives under this paragraph shall not apply to:\n\n(A) Lump sum payments for the cost of the facility upgrade;\n\n(B) Payments on a per vehicle basis; and\n\n(C) Any facility-related incentive program in effect with one or more dealers in the State on July 1, 2018.\n\nNothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow a franchised motor vehicle dealer to impair or eliminate a manufacturer's or distributor's intellectual property or trademark rights and trade dress usage guidelines; impair other intellectual property interests owned or controlled by the manufacturer or distributor, including the design and use of signs; or refuse to change the design or branding of any signage or other branded items required by a manufacturer or distributor at any time, if the manufacturer or distributor requires those changes of all of its franchised dealers nationally;\n\n(7) Require the dealer to establish or maintain an exclusive showroom or facility unless justified by current and reasonably expected future economic conditions existing in the dealer's market and the automobile industry at the time the request for an exclusive showroom or facility is made; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict the terms and conditions of any agreement for which the dealer has voluntarily accepted separate and valuable consideration;\n\n(8) Condition the award of an additional franchise on the dealer entering a site control agreement or the dealer waiving its rights to protest the manufacturer's or distributor's award of an additional franchise within the dealer's relevant market area; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict the terms and conditions of any agreement for which the dealer has voluntarily accepted separate and valuable consideration;\n\n(9) Require a dealer or the dealer's employees to attend a training program that does not relate directly to the sales or service of a new motor vehicle in the line make of that sold or serviced, or both, by the dealer;\n\n(10) Require a dealer to pay all or part of the cost of an advertising campaign or contest, or purchase any promotional materials, showroom, or other display decorations or materials at the expense of the dealer without the consent of the dealer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;\n\n(11) Implement or establish a customer satisfaction index or other system measuring a customer's degree of satisfaction with a dealer as a sale or service provider unless any such system is designed and implemented in such a way that is fair and equitable to both the manufacturer and the dealer. In any dispute between a manufacturer, distributor, and a dealer, the party claiming the benefit of the system as justification for acts in relation to the franchise shall have the burden of demonstrating the fairness and equity of the system ­ both in design and implementation in relation to the pending dispute. Upon request of any dealer, a manufacturer or distributor shall disclose in writing to such dealer a description of how that system is designed and applied to such dealer;\n\n(12) Implement or establish an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unfair sales or service performance standard in determining a dealer's compliance with a franchise agreement. If the sales or service performance standard is to be used as the basis for a termination of a dealer, then the performance standard shall be deemed unreasonable, arbitrary, or unfair if the standard does not include material and relevant local market factors, including but not limited to the geography of the dealer's assigned territory as set forth in the franchise agreement, market demographics, change in population, product popularity, number of competitor dealers, and consumer travel patterns;\n\n(13) Implement or establish a system of motor vehicle allocation or distribution to one or more of its dealers that is unfair, inequitable, or unreasonably discriminatory. As used in this paragraph, \"unfair\" includes without limitation, requiring a dealer to accept new vehicles not ordered by the dealer or the refusal or failure to offer to any dealer all models offered to its other same line make dealers in the State. The failure to deliver any motor vehicle shall not be considered a violation of this section if such failure is due to an act of God, work stoppage, or delay caused by a strike or labor difficulty, shortage of products or materials, freight delays, embargo, or other causes of which the motor vehicle franchisor shall have no control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a dealer may be required by a manufacturer or distributor to make reasonable facility improvements and technological upgrades necessary to support the technology of the manufacturer's or distributor's vehicles.
