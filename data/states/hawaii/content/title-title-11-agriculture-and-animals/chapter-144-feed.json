Before the department reports a violation for prosecution, an opportunity shall be given the distributor or owner to present the distributor's or owner's view to the department.\n\n(d) The department may apply for and the court may grant a temporary or permanent injunction restraining any person from violating or continuing to violate this chapter or any rule promulgated under the chapter notwithstanding the existence of other remedies at law.
