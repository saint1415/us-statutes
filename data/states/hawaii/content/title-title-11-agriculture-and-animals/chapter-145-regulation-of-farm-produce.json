In addition, each application shall be accompanied by the surety bond required by section 145-4.\n\n(2) Agents: Each application shall include the name and address of each commission merchant, dealer, or broker represented or sought to be represented by the agent, the written indorsement or nomination of the commission merchant, dealer, or broker, and such additional information as the department may consider proper or necessary. The department shall thereupon issue to the applicant a license entitling the applicant to conduct the business described in the application at the place named in the application for a year from the date thereof, or until the same is revoked for cause; provided that the license of an agent shall expire upon the date of expiration of the license of the principal for whom the agent acts. The department may also issue to each agent a card or cards which shall bear the signature of the agent, separate cards being required for each principal. Any agent shall show the card or cards upon the request of any interested person. Any agent who displays a void or expired license card shall be punished as provided in section 145-12.\n\nFraud or misrepresentation in making any application shall ipso facto work a revocation of any license granted thereunder. All indicia of the possession of a license shall be at all times the property of the State and each licensee shall be entitled to the possession thereof only for the duration of the license.\n\nFor filing the application for license, each applicant shall pay a fee as prescribed by the department.\n\nShould any commission merchant, dealer, broker, agent, processor, or retail merchant refuse, fail, or neglect to apply for the renewal of a preexisting license within thirty days after the expiration thereof, a penalty of forty per cent shall apply to and be added to the original fee as prescribed by the department, and shall be paid by the applicant before the renewal license may be issued.\n\nAny person who has applied for and obtained a license within the classification of commission merchant, in the manner and upon payment of the fee set forth, may apply for and secure a license in the other classifications without payment of further fee, and upon further complying with those provisions of this part regulating the licensing of the other particular classification involved.

The bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with this chapter and upon the faithful and honest handling or negotiation of the purchase or sale of farm products in accordance with this chapter. The bond shall be to the State in favor of every producer-consignor of farm products grown within the State. Any producer-consignor of farm products grown within the State claiming to be injured by the fraud, deceit, or wilful negligence of any commission merchant or broker may bring action upon the bond against both principal and surety in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the damages caused by such fraud, deceit, or wilful negligence, or the failure to comply with this chapter. In case of failure by a commission merchant to pay producer-consignor creditors for farm products received from the consignors to be sold or failure by a broker to pay producer-consignor creditors for farm products delivered to and paid for by a buyer as a result of a negotiated sale by the broker on behalf of the producer, the department shall proceed forthwith to ascertain the names and addresses of all producer-consignor creditors of the commission merchant or broker, together with the amounts due and owing to them and each of them by the commission merchant or broker, and shall request all the producer-consignor creditors to file a verified statement of their respective claims with the department. The request shall be addressed to each known producer-consignor creditor at its last known address. If a producer-consignor creditor so addressed fails, refuses, or neglects to file in the office of the department its verified claim as requested by the department within ninety days from the date of such request, the department shall thereupon be relieved of further duty or action hereunder on behalf of the producer-consignor creditor.\n\nUpon ascertaining all claims and statements in the manner herein set forth, the department may then make demand upon the bond on behalf of those claimants whose statements have been filed, and shall have the power to settle or compromise the claims with the surety company on the bond, and is empowered in such cases to execute and deliver a release and discharge of the bond involved. Upon the refusal of the surety company to pay demand, the department shall thereupon bring an action on the bond in behalf of the producer-consignor creditors. Upon any action being commenced on the bond, the department may require the filing of a new bond and immediately upon the recovery in any action on the bond such commission merchant or broker shall file a new bond and upon failure to file the same within ten days in either case, such failure shall constitute ground for the suspension or revocation of the commission merchant's or broker's license.

If the lawful owner is determined and located, the agricultural, aquacultural, or horticultural commodity shall be released to the lawful owner.\n\n(b) If for any reason the agricultural commodity is not released to the lawful owner after being in the custody of the law enforcement officer or other officer or employee for forty-eight hours, or less in the case of highly perishable commodities, the commodity may be sold at fair market value to any retailer, wholesaler, or packer of the commodity. All of the proceeds derived from the sale shall be held by the law enforcement officer or other officer or employee for not longer than six months, during which time the lawful owner of the commodity may submit satisfactory proof of ownership and obtain possession of the proceeds. The owner may be held responsible for any costs and expenses that may be incurred by the law enforcement officer or other officer or employee. Any proceeds of sale not recovered within six months for lack of a claim or for insufficient proof shall be treated as unclaimed property of the State.\n\n(c) Any commodity that remains unsold after being offered for sale pursuant to this section may be donated to a nonprofit charitable organization or destroyed at the discretion of the law enforcement officer or other officer or employee.\n\n(d) For the purposes of this section, \"officer or employee\" means any officer or employee of the department of agriculture or any other person authorized and designated by the board of agriculture to investigate and enforce this chapter and all rules adopted by the department pursuant thereto.
