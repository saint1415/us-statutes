The department may also conduct investigations and surveys to determine the feasibility and practicability of controlling widespread noxious weed infestations. The methods of control or eradication adopted by the department for any noxious weed infestation shall cause as little damage to crops and property as possible.\n\n(c) Upon determining that control or eradication of an infestation is practicable and feasible, the department shall immediately serve notice, either oral or written, on both the landowner of the property and the occupant of the property on which the infestations exist. Written notice sent to the landowner's address last known to the department by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, shall be deemed sufficient notice. In the event that certified mail is impractical because the department, despite diligent efforts, cannot determine land ownership or because of urgent need to initiate control or eradication measures, notice given once in a daily or weekly publication of general circulation, in the county where any action or proposed action will be taken, or notice made as otherwise provided by law, shall be deemed sufficient notice. The notice shall set forth all pertinent information with respect to the infestation and notify the landowner and the land occupant of the procedure and methods of control or eradication.\n\n(d) Upon the department's notification pursuant to subsection (c) above, the department may enter into a cooperative agreement with the landowner and land occupier for the control or eradication of the noxious weed infestation. The procedures and conditions for executing the cooperative agreement shall be in accordance with rules adopted under section 152-2(2).\n\n(e) Upon the department's notification pursuant to subsection (c) above, the department may entirely undertake the eradication or control project when it has been determined that the owner, occupier, or lessee of the land on which the noxious weed infestation is located will not benefit materially or financially by the control or eradication of the noxious weed; or when the noxious weed infestation is on state-owned land not leased or under control of private interest.
