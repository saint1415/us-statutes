      "text": "§161-2 Findings and declaration of necessity.It is hereby declared that the poultry industry is a paramount agricultural industry of this State and the production and marketing of poultry is an enterprise that is of significant importance to the economy of the State and to the health of the consuming public. It is essential to the public health and welfare of consumers that they be protected by assuring that poultry or poultry products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded poultry or poultry products are injurious to the public health and welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged poultry or poultry products, and result in sundry losses to poultry producers and processors of poultry as well as injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally. It is hereby found that regulation by the department of agriculture and cooperation by this State with the United States Department of Agriculture as contemplated by this chapter is appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and otherwise to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\n\nThe 90th Congress enacted Public Law 90-492, entitled \"The Wholesome Poultry Products Act\", which is now redesignated as the \"Poultry Products Inspection Act\". The Poultry Products Inspection Act is intended to protect the consuming public from adulterated or misbranded poultry or poultry products and to assist the states in their efforts to accomplish this objective. The Poultry Products Inspection Act authorizes the United States Secretary of Agriculture to furnish financial and related assistance to states for the administration of poultry inspection programs which conform to established federal standards up to fifty per cent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative program. Hawaii's poultry industry is not subject to poultry inspection law or rules and regulations that meet the minimum federal requirement in this area. In order to qualify for the cooperative program, the State must demonstrate \"progressive action\" by July 18, 1970; and, further, all physical facilities must be upgraded in accordance with the established federal standards by July 18, 1971. Failure to comply with the standards prescribed by the Poultry Products Inspection Act will result in federal control of the poultry or poultry processing industries of the State. Accordingly, the State of Hawaii deems it to be in the interest of the State's public health and welfare to take such steps as are necessary to qualify for federal financial and related assistance for the administration of a poultry inspection program which conforms to federal standards prescribed in the Poultry Products Inspection Act.

All official marks may be required by the representative to be removed from the poultry or poultry product before it is released unless it appears to the satisfaction of the board that the poultry or poultry product is eligible to retain the marks.\n\n(b) Any carcass, part of a carcass, poultry, or poultry product, or any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased poultry that is being transported in intrastate commerce or is held for sale in the State after being so transported and that (1) is or has been prepared, sold, transported, or otherwise distributed or offered or received for distribution in violation of this chapter, or (2) is capable of use as human food and is adulterated or misbranded, or (3) in any other way is in violation of this chapter, shall be liable to be proceeded against and seized and condemned, at any time, in any court within the jurisdiction of which the poultry or poultry product is found. If the poultry or poultry product is condemned, it shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may direct and the proceeds, if sold, less the court costs and fees and storage and other proper expenses, shall be paid into the general fund of the State, but the poultry or poultry product shall not be sold contrary to this chapter or the Poultry Products Inspection Act or the Hawaii or Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; provided that upon the execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond issued on the condition that the poultry or poultry product shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of contrary to this chapter or the laws of the United States, the court may direct that the poultry or poultry product be delivered to the owner thereof subject to supervision by authorized representatives of the board as is necessary to insure compliance with the applicable laws. When a decree of condemnation is entered against the poultry or poultry product and it is released under bond, or destroyed, court costs and fees and storage and other proper expenses shall be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the poultry or poultry product.\n\n(c) The circuit courts of the State are vested with jurisdiction specifically to enforce and to prevent and restrain violations of this chapter and shall have jurisdiction in all other kinds of cases arising under this chapter; provided that the district courts of the State shall have jurisdiction over misdemeanors committed under this chapter.\n\n(d) Any person who forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person engaged in the performance of official duties under this chapter shall be guilty of a class C felony.\n\n(e) Any person who violates any provision of this chapter for which no other criminal penalty is provided by this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor; but if the violation involves intent to defraud or any distribution or attempted distribution of poultry or poultry product that is adulterated, the person shall be guilty of a class C felony; provided that no person shall be subject to penalties under this section for receiving for transportation any poultry or poultry product in violation of this chapter if the receipt was made in good faith, unless the person refuses to furnish on request of a representative of the board the name and address of the person from whom the poultry or poultry product was received and copies of all documents, if there are any, pertaining to the delivery of the poultry or poultry product.\n\n(f) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the board to issue citations and summons or to report for prosecution or injunction proceedings for minor violations of this chapter whenever it believes that the public interest will be adequately served by a suitable written notice of warning. In determining whether the public interest will be adequately served by a written notice of warning, the board shall take into account, among other factors:\n\n(1) The compliance history of the persons responsible;\n\n(2) The magnitude of the violation;\n\n(3) Whether compliance with this chapter would likely result from that notice; and\n\n(4) Whether the violation is of a minor or technical nature.\n\n(g) Any person who neglects or refuses to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce documentary evidence, if in that person's power to do so in obedience to the subpoena or lawful requirement of the board, shall be guilty of an offense and, upon conviction thereof by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\n\n(h) Any person who wilfully makes, or causes to be made, any false entry or statement of fact in any report required to be made under this chapter, or who wilfully makes, or causes to be made, any false entry in any account, record, or memorandum kept by any person subject to this chapter, or wilfully neglects or fails to make, or causes not to be made, full, true, and correct entries in the accounts, records, or memoranda of all facts and transactions appertaining to the business of the person, or wilfully removes out of the jurisdiction of the State, or wilfully mutilates, alters, or by any other means falsifies any documentary evidence of any person, or wilfully refuses to submit to the board or to any of its authorized agents, for the purpose of inspection and taking copies, any documentary evidence of any person in the person's possession or within the person's control, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\n\n(i) If any person required by this chapter to file any annual or special report fails to do so within the time fixed by the board and the failure continues for thirty days after notice of default, that person shall forfeit to the State the sum of $100 for each day of the continuance of the failure, which forfeiture shall be payable into the state general fund and shall be recoverable in a civil suit in the name of the State brought in the county where the person's principal office is located or in any county in which the person does business. It shall be the duty of the county attorneys or corporation counsel of the respective counties within the State, upon request of the attorney general, to prosecute for the recovery of the forfeitures.\n\n(j) Any officer or employee of the State who makes public any confidential information obtained by the board, unless directed by a court, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.
