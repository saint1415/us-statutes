Supp. 2d 1220 (2010).\n\nBecause defendant obtained judgment in the action, the twenty-five per cent limitation on attorneys' fees should be based upon the amount sued for, i.e., the value of the loan amount. 933 F. Supp. 2d 1264 (2013).\n\nIn order to be deemed the prevailing party for purposes of this section, defendant must have obtained final judgment in its favor.

Supp. 2d 1264 (2013).\n\nWhere two of the five claims in the complaint were in the nature of assumpsit, the court could not practicably apportion between the assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims because the claims were inextricably intertwined.

thus plaintiff could recover fees under this section for services rendered by firm. 87 H. 37, 951 P.2d 487 (1998).\n\nWhere plaintiffs prevailed \"on the disputed main issue\", they were entitled to recoup all of their litigation expenses pursuant to this section. 87 H. 37, 951 P.2d 487 (1998).\n\nAs this section does not expressly or obviously manifest an intent to be applied retroactively, the 1993 amendment does not apply retroactively to litigation terminated prior to the effective date of the amendment, July 1, 1993. 88 H. 46, 961 P.2d 611 (1998).\n\nProper cap on the maximum amount of attorneys' fees that can be awarded as a result of circuit court action where final judgment was entered in 1992 is that found in the statute in effect in 1992; this statutory cap is the maximum total amount that can be awarded, not an amount that can be awarded to each prevailing party. 88 H. 46, 961 P.2d 611 (1998).\n\nWhere the maximum possible judgment is capable of determination, it should serve as a limit on the amount of the defendant's attorney's fees pursuant to this section. 88 H. 115, 962 P.2d 374 (1998).\n\nWhere reduction of the attorneys' fees requested was supported by the record, trial court's reduction of fees without explanation was not abuse of discretion. 90 H. 25, 975 P.2d 1145 (1998).\n\nAward of attorneys' fees for defendant erroneous where plaintiff's claims against defendant stemmed primarily from allegations of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and statutory violations, not breach of contract. 92 H. 243, 990 P.2d 713 (1999).\n\nWhere purchaser prevailed on its claim to the contract deposit and successfully defended against plaintiff's specific performance/breach claim, purchaser, \"on balance\", was the prevailing party on the issues in the case and was thus entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees under this section. 92 H. 482, 993 P.2d 516 (2000).\n\nPlaintiff not entitled to attorneys' fees pursuant to this section for plaintiff's appeal as an appeal is not a distinct \"action\" but a continuation of the original action and plaintiff's underlying action in the trial court sounded in tort and not assumpsit. 93 H. 1, 994 P.2d 1047 (2000).\n\nA defendant who succeeds in obtaining a judgment of dismissal is a prevailing party for the purposes of fees under this section. 96 H. 327, 31 P.3d 184 (2001).\n\nIn appropriate cases, a request or award of attorneys' fees may include compensation for separately billed legal services performed by a paralegal, legal assistant, or law clerk; the reasonableness of legal assistant fees must be reviewed on a case by case basis for the value of services rendered and an award of such fees must be limited to charges for work performed that would otherwise have been required to be performed by a licensed attorney at a higher rate. 96 H. 327, 31 P.3d 184 (2001).\n\nAs proceedings under §431:15-323 are not in the nature of assumpsit, trial court did not err in denying insurance commissioner attorneys' fees under this section in suit against customer of liquidated mutual benefit society. 99 H. 53, 52 P.3d 823 (2002).\n\nSection applies only to court actions and not arbitration proceedings; thus, section does not affect disputes submitted in arbitration. 102 H. 210, 74 P.3d 33 (2003).\n\nThe plain language of this section does not require a judgment on the merits; a dismissal of plaintiff's action, albeit voluntary, was sufficient to deem a defendant to be the prevailing party and the plaintiff the losing party; thus defendant was the \"prevailing party\" and plaintiff was the \"losing party\" for the purpose of awarding attorneys' fees pursuant to this section. 103 H. 26, 79 P.3d 119 (2003).\n\nTrial court erred in awarding attorneys' fees to insurer pursuant to this section as this section does not provide for attorneys' fees in declaratory judgment actions; relief sought by insured and insurer was a declaration as to the applicability of insurance coverage for insured's injuries, not money damages, and was thus not in the nature of assumpsit. 103 H. 263, 81 P.3d 1178 (2003).\n\nWhere record on appeal did not reflect whether the trial court apportioned fees between assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims, appellate court could not effectively review whether trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees as it did; thus, case vacated and remanded for redetermination. 107 H. 106, 111 P.3d 1 (2005).\n\nWhere allowing insurer to seek attorney's fees under this section would have contravened the attorney's fee award scheme set forth in §431:10C-211, trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying insurer's motion for attorney's fees and costs. 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850 (2006).\n\nWhere underlying appeal involved an adjudication of rights in which no monetary liability was in issue, the twenty-five per cent limitation was inapplicable to the case. 110 H. 217, 131 P.3d 500 (2006).\n\nWhere plaintiff's allegations were that engineering firm's and State's negligent failure to protect plaintiff from \"dangerous and/or defective conditions\" legally caused plaintiff's injuries, plaintiff's claims sounded in tort, not assumpsit; thus, plaintiff was not entitled to attorney's fees under this section. 110 H. 269, 132 P.3d 378 (2006).\n\nPlaintiff entitled to attorneys' fees under this section where plaintiff successfully defended claim of breach of contract; trial court did not abuse discretion in awarding attorneys' fees where amount was well within twenty-five per cent of the judgment, was well-documented, and trial judge had personal knowledge of the complexity of the litigation and the nature and quality of the legal services rendered before it. 111 H. 286, 141 P.3d 459 (2006).\n\nTrial court did not abuse discretion in denying defendants' motion for attorneys' fees under this section where lien application was brought pursuant to the mechanic's lien statute, §507-47, and, as such, was not a common law action, and the action was for the attachment of a mechanic's lien to the subject property, not for damages based upon the underlying contract; thus, the action was not in the nature of assumpsit. 111 H. 349, 141 P.3d 996 (2006).\n\nWhere plaintiffs' claims for relief did not involve monetary damages based upon the non-performance of a contractual agreement for legal services between defendants and hotel operator, but primarily requested a declaration and injunction, the \"essential character\" of the action was not in the nature of assumpsit; thus, trial court abused its discretion in granting attorneys' fees to defendants. 113 H. 251, 151 P.3d 732 (2007).\n\nWhere homeowner association was a nonprofit organization and the covenants in its first declaration ran with the land, it was a \"planned community association\" for purposes of this section; thus, association was not subject to the twenty-five per cent cap on its attorneys' fees incurred on appeal. 114 H. 361, 162 P.3d 1277 (2007).\n\nBased on the plain language of this section and, because the amount the jury awarded terminated attorney plaintiff differed from the amount sued for, the amount of attorneys' fees awarded varied when the prevailing party changed from plaintiff to defendant law firm; as law firm limited its fee request to its assumpsit claim, the calculation of which was dictated by this section, it was unnecessary for the trial court to apportion fees between assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims; and, as there was adequate documentation, trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting law firm's motion for attorneys' fees. 117 H. 92, 176 P.3d 91 (2008).\n\nThe plain language of §658A-21(b) and its related commentary from the Uniform Arbitration Act established that awards of attorneys' fees can be valid and authorized based on a party agreement, even if the resulting award exceeds the twenty-five per cent of the judgment limitation included in this section. 123 H. 476, 236 P.3d 456 (2010).\n\nSection did not apply to plaintiff's suit for specific performance, but applied to defendant's counterclaim in the nature of assumpsit. 2 H.

In determining whether claims or defenses are frivolous, the court may consider whether the party alleging that the claims or defenses are frivolous had submitted to the party asserting the claims or defenses a request for their withdrawal as provided in subsection (c). If the court determines that only a portion of the claims or defenses made by the party are frivolous, the court shall determine a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees and costs in relation to the frivolous claims or defenses.\n\n(c) A party alleging that claims or defenses are frivolous may submit to the party asserting the claims or defenses a request for withdrawal of the frivolous claims or defenses, in writing, identifying those claims or defenses and the reasons they are believed to be frivolous.
