Any aboriginal title that plaintiff may have had was extinguished; plaintiff failed to show that its use and occupancy of the area was exclusive as required by the doctrine. 875 F. Supp. 680.\n\nPlaintiff's claims of reserved rights of native tenants under Hawaii law did not extend to the right of perpetual and exclusive occupancy upon the land of another; plaintiff's ancestors' failure to claim kuleana title to subject land, which rendered them tenants at sufferance, foreclosed plaintiff's attempt to claim possessory rights to the land under Hawaii law. 875 F. Supp. 680.\n\nStatutes in derogation of common law strictly construed. 5 H. 41; 9 H. 23, 25; 10 H. 151, 159; 22 H. 765, 767 (explaining earlier cases); 23 H. 541, 545; 37 H. 374, 379 (ordinance); 37 H. 571, 580; 49 H. 624, 628, 425 P.2d 1014; 50 H. 201, 436 P.2d 752. But should nevertheless be construed in accordance with legislative purpose. 41 H. 442, 459; 44 H. 59, 67, 352 P.2d 335.\n\nGrounds for annulment held exclusively statutory. 8 H. 77.\n\nInterpretation of words in criminal statute according to common law meaning. 8 H. 259; 22 H. 618, 629; 33 H. 560, 563.\n\nMarriage controlled by statute, no common law marriage. 25 H. 397.\n\nUsury statute as superseding common law. 36 H. 107.\n\nStatute codifying common law, interpreted according to modern decisions. 39 H. 460, 465, aff'd 205 F.2d 616.\n\nCommon law as background in applying statutes prescribing time and place of trial. 46 H. 197, 209, note 4, 377 P.2d 728.\n\nThe common law recognizes a cause of action for invasion of right of privacy where defendant uses plaintiff's name or picture for commercial purposes. 50 H. 374, 441 P.2d 141.\n\nCommon law holds that right to rent to accrue on a lease of real property is an interest in realty.

Retention of a Hawaiian tradition should in each case be determined by balancing respective interests and harm once it is established that application of the custom has continued in a particular area. 66 H. 1, 656 P.2d 745.\n\n\"Hawaiian usage\" clause may establish certain customary Hawaiian rights beyond those found in §7-1. 73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247.\n\nCommon law rights ordinarily associated with tenancy do not limit customary rights existing under the laws of Hawaii. 79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.\n\nDescendants of native Hawaiians who inhabited islands prior to 1778 who assert valid customary and traditional Hawaiian rights under this section entitled to protection regardless of their blood quantum. 79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.\n\nHawaii constitution and this section require county planning commission to \"preserve and protect\" reasonable exercise of customary or traditional native Hawaiian rights to the extent feasible when issuing special management area use permits. 79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.\n\nIf property is deemed \"fully developed\", i.e., lands zoned and used for residential purposes with existing dwellings, improvements, and infrastructure, it is always \"inconsistent\" to permit the practice of traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights on such property. 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.\n\nTo establish the existence of a traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice, there must be an adequate foundation in the record connecting the claimed right to a firmly rooted traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice. 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.\n\nWhere defendant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support claim of the exercise of a constitutionally protected native Hawaiian right and knowingly entered landowner's property which was fenced in a manner to exclude others, trial court properly concluded that defendant was unlawfully on property in violation of §708-814(1). 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.\n\nJudicial precedents prior to adoption of common law by this statute (with cases applying these precedents).\n\nDelivery of seisin obsolete. 1 H. 17. Deed reserving life estate valid. 4 H. 515, 517; 5 H. 484.

Bolton (1 Camp. 493) that death of human being not an injury, so as to permit personal representative to sue for lost earnings under survival statute ( §663-7). 45 H. 373, 369 P.2d 96.\n\nRule that conveyance to two or more construed as joint tenancy, rejected. 5 H. 543; 8 H. 392, 396.
