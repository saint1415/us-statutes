It was the working philosophy of native Hawaiians and was presented as a gift to the people of Hawaii. \"Aloha\" is more than a word of greeting or farewell or a salutation. \"Aloha\" means mutual regard and affection and extends warmth in caring with no obligation in return. \"Aloha\" is the essence of relationships in which each person is important to every other person for collective existence. \"Aloha\" means to hear what is not said, to see what cannot be seen and to know the unknowable.\n\n(b) In exercising their power on behalf of the people and in fulfillment of their responsibilities, obligations and service to the people, the legislature, governor, lieutenant governor, executive officers of each department, the chief justice, associate justices, and judges of the appellate, circuit, and district courts may contemplate and reside with the life force and give consideration to the \"Aloha Spirit\".

The flag shall not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground.\n\nTo fold the Hawaiian flag ceremoniously, first fold it lengthwise, bringing the striped half up over the jack. Then repeat, with the jack on the outside. Beginning at the lower right, make a series of triangular folds until the flag resembles a cocked hat with only the jack visible.\n\nThe Hawaiian flag shall be flown at half-mast by first raising it to the top of the flagpole, and then slowly lowering it to a position one-fourth of the distance down the flagpole, and there leaving it during the time it is to be displayed. In taking the flag down, it shall first be raised to the top of the flagpole, and then slowly lowered with appropriate ceremony.\n\nWhen the Hawaiian flag is in such condition of repair that it is no longer a suitable emblem for displaying, it shall be totally destroyed, preferably by burning, and that privately; or this shall be done by some other method in keeping with the spirit of respect and reverence that all owe the emblem that represents the Aloha State of Hawaii.
