      "text": "Driver improvement programsA. Whenever, in a misdemeanor case, a person is convicted of violating any law of this state that regulates traffic or any parish or municipal ordinance that regulates traffic, or when a child is decreed by a court to be a traffic violator, regardless of any sentence imposed, the court imposing sentence may order the person or child to attend and participate in a driver education, training, or improvement program approved by the court or the violator may choose a program approved by the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, office of motor vehicles as provided and pursuant to the conditions in R.S. 32:402.2.B. Notwithstanding the provision of any other law to the contrary, upon conviction for the first time only of a misdemeanor offense under Title 32 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950 that regulates traffic or of any similar parish or municipal ordinance that regulates traffic, the court may suspend the sentence for such offense and order the defendant to attend, at his cost, a driver education, training, or improvement program as provided for in Paragraph A of this Article.C. Upon completion by the defendant of the driver program, the court may set the conviction aside and dismiss the prosecution.D. All driver improvement courses under this Article shall include instruction on railroad and highway grade crossing safety.E.

The report shall indicate that the course was taken under the provisions of this Article to determine eligibility to take a subsequent course under such provisions.(3) No insurance company shall increase the premium or cancel an insured's policy merely because of an offense dismissed under this Article or because the insured completed a driving course under this Article.I.
