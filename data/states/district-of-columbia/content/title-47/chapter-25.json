Each financial institution shall calculate its tax liability as follows:\n\n(i) For the first transition year, the franchise tax plus 100% of the difference between the total of the franchise tax plus the personal property tax and the gross earnings tax computed for the same taxable year; provided, that the computed gross earnings tax is greater than the total of the franchise tax plus the personal property tax; and\n\n(ii) For the 2nd transition year, the franchise tax plus 66 2/3% of the difference between the total of the franchise tax plus the personal property tax and the gross earnings tax computed for the same taxable year; provided, that the computed gross earnings tax is greater than the total of the franchise tax plus the personal property tax;\n\n(iii) For the 3rd transition year, the franchise tax plus 33 1/3% of the difference between the total of the franchise tax plus the personal property tax and the gross earnings tax computed for the same taxable year; provided, that the computed gross earnings tax is greater than the total of the franchise tax plus the personal property tax.\n\n(B) In no event shall the total tax levied be less than the franchise tax plus the personal property tax.

During the transition period referred to in subsection (b), there shall be excluded from the gross earnings tax and franchise tax computation all earnings resulting from any IBF time deposit or IBF loan.\n\n(d) The Mayor may grant a reasonable extension of time for filing the returns required by subsection (c) of this section whenever in his judgment good cause exists therefor, and he shall keep a record of every such extension. Except in the case of a taxpayer who is not within the continental limits of the United States, no extension shall be granted for more than 6 months, and in no case shall such extension be granted for more than 1 year.",
