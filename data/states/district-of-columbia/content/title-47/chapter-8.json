All notices of final determination shall be accompanied by the assessor’s worksheets indicating the rationale for the determination, if the assessment is raised or lowered. If a notice of final determination on a petition for an administrative review brought under subsection (1) and (2) of this section and the assessor’s worksheets relating thereto, if required, are not mailed to the owner by August 1 preceding the tax year, the owner may appeal the proposed assessed value or classification to the Commission by September 30 preceding the tax year; provided, that if a delayed notice is issued under § 47-824(b)(4), September 1 and October 15 of the tax year shall be substituted for August 1 and September 30, respectively.\n\n(i) If an owner is aggrieved by a notice of final determination issued pursuant to § 42-3131.15 or the time period to issue a notice of final determination under that section has expired, the owner may file an appeal on the determination of vacancy with the Commission within 45 days after the date of the notice or expiration.

If the applicant fails to pay timely to the Mayor, the amount of the deferred tax, plus interest thereon, shall bear interest at the rate provided for the payment of delinquent real property taxes, plus applicable penalties thereon.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, if the real property of the senior’s household is transferred and continued to qualify for the deferral 30 days or less before the date of execution of the deed of transfer, the individual, shareholder, or member shall not be required to notify the Mayor of the change in eligibility.\n\n(3) If the change in eligibility occurs during the period October 1 through March 31 of the tax year, the deferral shall be disallowed for the entire tax year.\n\n(4) If the change in eligibility occurs during the period April 1 through September 30, the deferral shall be disallowed for only 1/2 of the property taxes for the year.\n\n(A) If a filed application is properly completed and not disapproved, taxes deferred shall remain deferred and the taxes from prospective tax years shall continue to be deferred notwithstanding household adjusted gross income applicable to prospective tax years that exceeds the threshold in subsection (a)(4)(D) of this section.\n\n(B) This paragraph shall not apply where the senior’s household no longer qualifies for the deferral for any other reason.\n\n(j) If real property tax is owing as a result of an erroneous or improper deferral, the following shall apply:\n\n(A) If the senior’s household was transferred, the individual shall be personally liable for the amount of the delinquent real property tax which was not paid timely during the period when the individual had an ownership interest in the senior’s household, together with interest at the same rate as provided in this chapter for the late payment of real property tax.\n\n(B) The tax shall be considered due on the date that the total amount of real property tax was due but unpaid and shall be collected in the manner prescribed under Chapter 44.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, if the senior’s household was transferred and the grantee failed to timely record a deed under § 47-1431, there shall be a lien on the real property in the amount of the delinquent real property tax which was not timely paid, together with interest as provided in this chapter for the late payment of real property tax.\n\n(3) In all other cases, there shall be a lien on the real property in the amount of the delinquent real property tax which was not paid timely, together with interest as provided in this chapter for the late payment of real property tax.\n\n(k) The eligibility of a senior’s household for the deferral shall not be affected by the transfer of the senior’s household into a revocable trust if the transfer is without consideration and the senior’s household remains the residence of the individual-grantor before and after the transfer.\n\n(l) Only one individual in a household and that individual’s spouse or domestic partner, if any, shall claim a deferral for a senior’s household in the District.\n\n(m) If an individual claims more than one senior’s household in the same tax year, and has not timely notified the Mayor of all changes in eligibility, the Mayor shall disallow the deferral for all senior’s households claimed by the individual.\n\n(n) Section 47-863(k) shall apply in the case of deferral under this section.\n\n(o) The real property tax bill shall indicate whether the real property is receiving the deferral under this section. Any tax certificate shall indicate whether the real property is receiving the deferral under this section and the amount of deferred real property tax, interest thereon, and penalties. If a tax certificate does not contain the foregoing information, the eligible owner, and not the real property, shall be personally liable for the amount of deferred real property tax, interest thereon, and penalties.\n\n(p) Repealed.",

If the result of the appeal requires the special assessment to be adjusted in favor of the owner of the real property, a cash refund shall not be made (except in the last year of the contribution period), but an adjustment shall be made to the next special assessment to be collected from that real property. No interest on the adjustment shall be due to the owner of the real property. This procedure shall be exclusive and its exhaustion by an owner shall be a condition precedent to any other appeal or legal action by the owner.\n\n(h) If the Chief Financial Officer learns that real property subject to the special assessment has been omitted from the special assessment for any previous tax year before such notice, the Chief Financial Officer shall provide notice to the owner and shall collect the special assessment amount in arrears, including interest from the date the special assessment should have been paid; provided, that no real property that has escaped the special assessment shall be liable under this section for a period of more than 3 prior years of the contribution period.\n\n(i) Special assessments shall accrue based on the tax year and shall be billed in arrears semi-annually in the same manner, under the same conditions and with the same due dates, and subject to the same interest and penalty provisions for the non-payment thereof as provided in § 47-811 for the billing of real property tax.\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an unpaid special assessment shall be subject to the same penalty and interest provisions as a delinquent real property tax under this chapter. A lien for an unpaid special assessment, including penalty and interest, shall attach to the real property in the same manner as, and with a priority immediately junior to, a lien for delinquent real property tax under Chapter 13A of this title. The unpaid special assessment shall be collected in the same manner, under the same conditions, and subject to the same penalty as unpaid real property taxes.\n\n(2) If an interest or use on real property is subject to the special assessment because it is subject to taxation under § 47-1005.01, an unpaid special assessment on such an interest or use shall be subject to the same penalty and interest provisions as a delinquent tax imposed under § 47-1005.01 and the unpaid special assessment shall be collected in the same manner, under the same conditions, and subject to the same penalty as an unpaid tax imposed under § 47-1005.01.\n\n(k) A special assessment imposed under this subchapter shall not be required to be certified for the purposes of Chapter 13A of this title, nor shall a lien be required to be filed therefore [therefor] for sale in subsequent tax sales.\n\n(l) Each special assessment shall be made part of the public record.",
