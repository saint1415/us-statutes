The credit provided under this subsection shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due under this chapter that the amount of the individual’s adjusted gross income received by him, or accrued to him if on an accrual basis, subject to tax in the other jurisdiction bears to his entire adjusted gross income received by him, or accrued to him, while he was concurrently a resident of the District. The Mayor may require satisfactory proof of the payment of such income taxes to another jurisdiction. The credit provided by this subsection shall not be allowed against any tax imposed under §§ 47-1808.01 through 47-1808.06. Beginning with any taxable year after December 31, 1990, no franchise tax, license tax, excise tax, unincorporated business tax, occupation tax, or any tax characterized as such by the other taxing jurisdiction, even if applied to earned or business income, shall qualify as a credit under this section.\n\n(b) The amount deducted and withheld as tax under this chapter during any calendar year upon the wages of any individual shall be allowed as a credit to the recipient of the income against the tax imposed by this chapter, for taxable years beginning in such calendar year. If more than 1 taxable year begins in such calendar year such amount shall be allowed as a credit against the tax for the last taxable year so beginning.\n\n(A) If a return is filed for a full calendar or fiscal year beginning after December 31, 1988, but before January 1, 2025, an individual who incurs household and dependent care services necessary to engage in gainful employment and who is allowed a credit under § 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, shall be allowed, against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year, an amount equal to 32% of the credit allowed under § 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, regardless of the amount of the credit actually used to offset federal tax liability.\n\n(B) If a return is filed for a full calendar or fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2025, an individual who incurs household and dependent care services necessary to engage in gainful employment and who is allowed a credit under § 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, shall be allowed, against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year, an amount equal to 24.25% of the credit allowed under § 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, regardless of the amount of the credit actually used to offset federal tax liability.\n\n(2) If a return is filed for a period of less than a full calendar or fiscal year beginning after December 31, 1988, the credit allowed under this subsection shall be the credit calculated according to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, multiplied times the ratio that the employment-related expenses, allowed under § 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and incurred during the period of residency in the District, bear to the total employment-related expenses allowed under § 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and incurred for the whole taxable year.\n\n(3) In no event shall the credit allowed under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection exceed the amount of tax otherwise due without reference to this subsection.\n\n(d) This section shall take effect in accordance with the provisions of § 1-206.02(c)(1) and shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978.\n\n(A) If a return is filed for a full calendar year, the amount of the tax payable under this subchapter by a resident of the District with respect to the taxable year shall be reduced by a low income credit designed to make the District’s income tax threshold equal to the federal income tax threshold. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “tax threshold” means the point at which a taxpayer begins to owe income tax after allowance of the standard deduction and all personal exemptions to which the taxpayer is entitled, but before application of any itemized deductions or credits. The credit shall be calculated in accordance with a table prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n(i) If a return is filed for a period of less than a full calendar year beginning after December 31, 2014, the income eligibility for the credit allowed under this subsection shall be determined by annualizing the income earned during the portion of the year the taxpayer was a District resident.\n\n(ii) If a part-year resident meets the annualized income and other requirements of this subsection, the part-year resident shall be entitled to the pro rata share of the credit allowed by the annualized income. The pro rata share shall be determined by multiplying the credit allowed, from the table prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer, for the annualized income by the fraction consisting of the number of days the taxpayer was a District resident over 365 days (or, in the case of a leap year, 366 days).\n\n(2) The credit provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be allowed to a resident:\n\n(A) Who has a federal tax liability determined in accordance with section 55 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n\n(B) Who has net federal adjusted gross income in excess of the minimum federal income tax filing requirements. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term “net federal adjusted gross income” means federal adjusted gross income less:\n\n(i) Taxable refunds, credits, or offsets of state and local income tax;\n\n(ii) Tax-exempt municipal bond interest income; and\n\n(iii) Federal taxable amount of social security or tier 1 railroad retirement income; or\n\n(C) Who has elected to claim the earned income tax credit provided for in subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(3) In no event shall the credit allowed under paragraph (1) of this subsection exceed the amount of the tax otherwise due without reference to this section.\n\n(4) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the credit provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall no longer be allowed.\n\n(A) If a return is filed for a full calendar or fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2004, an individual who is allowed an earned income tax credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in an amount equal to 40% of the earned income tax credit allowed under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;

The amount of credit which is in excess of any rental supplements received shall constitute the eligible claimant’s total income tax credit under this section. If the amount of rental supplements received exceeds the amount of credit calculated under this section, then the eligible claimant’s credit shall equal zero.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section:\n\n(A) The term “household gross income” means gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal services of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, including salaries, wages, and compensation paid by the United States to its officers and employees, or income derived from any trade or business or sales or dealings in property whether real or personal, including capital assets as defined in this chapter growing out of the ownership or sale of or interest in such property; income from rent, royalties, interest, dividends, securities, or transactions of any trade or business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever, including but not limited to cash distributions from a business or investment entity in which the claimant has an interest, alimony, and separate maintenance payments (including amounts received under separate maintenance agreements), strike benefits, cash public assistance and relief (not including relief or credit granted under this section), sick pay, workmen’s compensation, proceeds of life insurance policies, the gross amount of any pension or annuity (including railroad retirement benefits, veterans’ disability pensions, or payment received under the federal Social Security Act), state or District of Columbia unemployment compensation laws, and nontaxable interest received from the United States, a state or any agency or instrumentality thereof. The word “income” does not include gifts from nongovernmental sources, food stamps, or food or other relief in kind supplied by a governmental agency.\n\n(B) In determining household gross income the exclusions from gross income as provided by § 47-1803.02(a) shall not apply.\n\n(2) The term “household income” shall have the same meaning as the words “adjusted gross income” as defined in subsection (c) [repealed] of § 47-1803.02 [see now § 47-1803.02(b)]. For purposes of determining adjusted gross income within the meaning of this section, gross income shall mean household income as defined in this section.\n\n(3) The term “home” means the claimant’s dwelling house, whether owned or rented by the claimant, and so much of the land surrounding it as is reasonably necessary for use of the dwelling as a home, and may include a multi-unit building or a multi-purpose building and a part of the land upon which it is located.\n\n(4) The term “claimant” means a person who has filed a claim under this section, was an owner of record of a home in the District, or a lessee, tenant at will, or tenant at sufferance paying rent on a home in the District, during the entire calendar year preceding the year in which he files a claim for relief under this section. Only one claimant per tax filing unit per year shall be entitled to relief under this section.\n\n(5) Repealed.\n\n(6) Repealed.\n\n(7) Repealed.\n\n(A) The term “rent paid” is that amount paid by a claimant to a landlord solely for the right of occupancy of a home in the District, including the right to use the personal property located therein. Utility charges may be included in the amount of rent paid if they are included in the amount paid to a landlord in connection with the right to occupancy. The term “rent paid” does not include:\n\n(i) Rental supplements obtained under the provisions of title III of the Rental Housing Act of 1977 [D.C. Law 2-54];\n\n(ii) Advance rental payments for another period;\n\n(iii) Rental deposits, whether or not expressly set out in the rental agreement;\n\n(iv) Any charges for medical services or food provided by the landlord; or\n\n(v) Payments made to a landlord for the right of occupancy of property which is exempt from District real property taxes.\n\n(B) The term “rent constituting property taxes accrued” means 20% of the rent paid in any calendar year by a claimant solely for the right of occupancy of his home in the calendar year, and which constitutes the basis of a claim in the succeeding calendar year for a credit for property taxes paid.\n\n(9) The term “eligible senior claimant” means a claimant who is 70 years or older at any time during the tax year and whose adjusted gross income does not exceed the eligibility income threshold amount.\n\n(10) The term \"base year\" means the calendar year beginning January 1, 2015, or the calendar year beginning one calendar year before the calendar year in which the new dollar amount of a maximum credit amount or eligibility income threshold amount shall become effective, whichever is later.\n\n(11) The term \"Consumer Price Index\" means, for any calendar year, the average of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-MD-VA-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area (or such successor metropolitan statistical area that includes the District), or any successor index, as of the close of the 12-month period ending on July 31 of such calendar year.\n\n(12) The term \"cost-of-living adjustment\" means, for any calendar year, the difference between the Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year and the Consumer Price Index for the base year, divided by the Consumer Price Index for the base year.\n\n(13) The term \"eligibility income threshold amount\" means:\n\n(A) For the taxable year beginning January 1, 2015, $60,000 for eligible senior claimants and $40,000 for all other claimants;\n\n(B) For the taxable year beginning January 1, 2016, $60,000 for eligible senior claimants and $40,000 for all other claimants, increased annually pursuant to the cost-of-living adjustment (if the adjustment does not result in a multiple of $100, rounded down to the next multiple of $100); and\n\n(C) For the taxable year beginning January 1, 2019, $75,000 for eligible senior claimants and $55,000 for all other claimants, increased annually pursuant to the cost-of-living adjustment (if the adjustment does not result in a multiple of $100, rounded down to the next multiple of $100).\n\n(14) The term \"maximum credit amount\" means:\n\n(A) For the taxable year beginning January 1, 2015, $1,000;\n\n(B) For the taxable year beginning January 1, 2016, $1,000, increased annually pursuant to the cost-of-living adjustment (if the adjustment does not result in a multiple of $25, rounded down to the next multiple of $25); and\n\n(C) For the taxable year beginning January 1, 2019, $1,200, increased annually pursuant to the cost-of-living adjustment (if the adjustment does not result in a multiple of $25, rounded down to the next multiple of $25).\n\n(c) In the event that any installment of rent for a calendar year for which a claim is filed is paid prior to the beginning of or subsequent to the end of such calendar year, it shall be included as rent for the year for which the claim was made and for no other year, and shall not be included as rent for purposes of this section for the year in which the installment was paid.\n\n(d) If the Mayor determines that the rent paid was not the result of an agreement entered into at arm’s length between the tenant and his landlord, the Mayor may adjust the rent to a reasonable amount for the purposes of this section.\n\n(1) Beginning with calendar year 1977, and for each succeeding calendar year, if a claimant owns and occupies his or her home in the District on December 31st of any such year, “property taxes accrued” means real property taxes (exclusive of special assessments, interest on a delinquency in payment of tax, and penalties and services charges) as reflected on the District real estate tax bill ordinarily sent out in September of such year; provided, however, that any amount of real property tax deferred under the provisions of §§ 47-845, 47-845.02 and 47-845.03 shall be considered as “property taxes accrued” for the purpose of determining the credit allowable under this section. If a home is an integral part of a larger unit such as a multi-purpose building or a multi-dwelling building, property taxes accrued shall be that percentage of the total property taxes accrued as the value of the home bears to the total value of the property.\n\n(2) When a claimant owns or rents 2 or more different homes in the District in the same calendar year, “property taxes accrued” or “rent constituting property taxes accrued” shall be based on the claimant’s status as an owner or renter on December 31st of such calendar year.\n\n(3) When a claimant rents 2 or more different homes in the District in the same calendar year, rent paid by the claimant during that year shall be determined by dividing the rent paid pursuant to the last rental agreement in force during that calendar year by the number of months during that calendar year for which this rent was paid and by multiplying the result by 12.\n\n(f) The right to file under this section shall be personal to the claimant, but such right may be exercised by his legal guardian or attorney-in-fact. The right to file a claim shall not survive the death of a claimant. If a claimant dies after having filed a claim, any amount refunded as a result thereof shall be disbursed to his estate; provided, that if no executor or administrator qualifies therein within 2 years of the filing of the claim, or no petition for distribution of a small estate is filed pursuant to §§ 20-2101 and 20-2102, the claim shall not be allowed.\n\n(g) Subject to the limitations provided in this section, commencing with the taxable year beginning after December 31, 1974, and for succeeding taxable years, the claimant may claim as a credit against the District income taxes otherwise due on his income, property taxes accrued or rent constituting property taxes accrued for that year. If the allowable amount of such claim exceeds the income taxes otherwise due from the claimant, or other tax liabilities of the claimant to the District, or if there are no District income taxes due from the claimant, the amount of the claim not used as an offset against income taxes or other tax liabilities of the claimant to the District shall be paid or credited to the claimant. No interest shall be allowed on any payment made to a claimant pursuant to this section.\n\n(h) No claim with respect to property taxes accrued or with respect to rent constituting property taxes accrued shall be allowed unless a District of Columbia individual income tax return or (if the claimant is not required to file such return) a claim for credit under this section is filed with the District on the forms and in such manner and with such information as the Mayor may prescribe. Any claim for credit shall be filed with the District on or before the expiration of the 3-year statute of limitations. The statute of limitations shall commence to run on April 15th of the year following the year for which the claim is made.\n\n(i) The amount of any claim otherwise payable under this section may be applied by the District against any outstanding tax liability of the claimant to the District.\n\n(1) In determining eligibility for the credit allowable under this section, and for the purpose of determining outstanding tax liability (if any) of the claimant to the District household income for which the claim is filed and the claimant’s outstanding tax liability (if any) shall be determined on the basis of the adjusted gross income of the tax filing unit, which is defined as an individual or married couple that would—were their income above the filing threshold—file an individual income tax return.\n\n(2) In the case of spouses or domestic partners who, during the entire calendar year for which a claim is filed under this section, maintain separate homes, for the purpose of determining household income and the claimant’s outstanding tax liability (if any), such spouses or domestic partners shall be deemed to have been unmarried during the calendar year for which the claim is made.\n\n(k) No credit shall be allowed under this subchapter for any year during which the person claiming the credit was a dependent, under any state, federal, or District law levying a tax on income, unless during that year such person is or becomes 65 years of age or older.\n\n(l) A claimant whose claim is based on the amount of rent paid shall substantiate the rent paid upon a request by the Mayor.\n\n(1) If, on an audit of any claim filed under this section, the Mayor finds the amount to have been incorrectly computed, he shall determine the correct amount and notify the claimant in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 47-1812.05.\n\n(2) If it is determined that a claim was filed with fraudulent intent, it shall be disallowed in full. If the claim has been paid or a credit has been allowed against income taxes otherwise payable, the credit shall be canceled and the amount paid shall be assessed against the claimant and recovered in the same manner as provided for the collection of taxes under § 47-412 [repealed].\n\n(n) No claim for relief under this section shall be allowed to any person who was not living in a home which was subject to District of Columbia real property taxation during the calendar year for which the claim is filed.\n\n(o) The Mayor is authorized to provide a table which will approximate, as closely as feasible, the amount of relief allowable under this section.\n\n(p) If it is determined by the District that a claimant received title to his home in the District or became legally obligated to pay rent for his home in the District primarily for the purpose of receiving benefits under the provisions of this section, his claim shall be disallowed.\n\n(q) The Council of the District of Columbia is empowered to make such changes in the amount of annual relief provided under subsection (a) of this section as it may deem proper.\n\n(r) [Repealed].\n\n(s) A claimant who is not required to file a return pursuant to § 47-1805.02 may file an alternative form prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer to claim the credit under this section. Notwithstanding § 47-1805.01(a), for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019, claimants filing an alternative form may file it electronically in a manner prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer.",

If the net income of a corporation, financial institution, or unincorporated business, or the unrelated business income of an exempt organization, is derived from sources within and without the District, the taxpayer shall apportion business income and allocate non-business income as provided in this section.\n\n(b) For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this section, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if:\n\n(1) In that state the taxpayer is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax; or\n\n(2) That state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not.\n\n(1) Rents and royalties from real or tangible personal property, capital gains, interest, dividends, or patent or copyright royalties, to the extent that they constitute non-business income, shall be allocated as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this subsection.\n\n(A) Net rents and royalties from real property located in the District are allocable to the District.\n\n(B) Net rents and royalties from tangible personal property are allocable to the District:\n\n(i) If and to the extent that the property is utilized in the District; or\n\n(ii) In their entirety if the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in the District and the taxpayer is not organized under the laws of or taxable in the state in which the property is utilized.\n\n(C) The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in a state is determined by multiplying the rents and royalties by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in the state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all rental or royalty periods in the taxable year. If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the taxpayer, the tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession.\n\n(A) Capital gains and losses from sales of real property located in the District are allocable to the District.\n\n(B) Capital gains and losses from sales of tangible personal property are allocable to the District if:\n\n(i) The property had a situs in the District at the time of the sale; or\n\n(ii) The taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in the District and the taxpayer is not taxable in the state in which the property had a situs.\n\n(C) Capital gains and losses from the sales of intangible personal property are allocable to the District if the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in the District.\n\n(4) Interest and dividends from District sources are allocable to the District unless the interest and dividends are excluded under § 47-1810.01.\n\n(A) Patent and copyright royalties are allocable to the District:\n\n(i) If and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in the District; or\n\n(ii) If and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the taxpayer in a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable and the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is in the District.\n\n(B) A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the state to the extent that a patented product is produced in the state. If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the patent is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is located.\n\n(C) A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the state. If the basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer’s commercial domicile is located.\n\n(d) Except as provided in subsection (d-1) or (d-2), whichever is applicable, all business income shall be apportioned to the District by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor, and the denominator of which is 3.\n\n(1) All business income shall be apportioned to the District by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor twice, and the denominator of which is 4.\n\n(2) This subsection shall be applicable for the tax years beginning after December 31, 2010, and before January 1, 2015.\n\n(1) All business income shall be apportioned to the District by multiplying the income by the sales factor.\n\n(2) This subsection shall be applicable for the tax years beginning after December 31, 2014.\n\n(1) The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in the District during the tax period and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period.\n\n(2) Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at 8 times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from sub-rentals.\n\n(3) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period, but the Mayor may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer’s property.\n\n(1) The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the District during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period.\n\n(2) Compensation is paid in the District if:\n\n(A) The individual’s service is performed entirely within the District;\n\n(B) The individual’s service is performed both within and without the District, but the service performed without the District is incidental to the individual’s service within the District; or\n\n(C) Some of the service is performed in the District and:\n\n(i) The base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the District; or\n\n(ii) The base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual’s residence is in the District.\n\n(1) The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in the District during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period.\n\n(2) Sales of tangible personal property are in the District if:\n\n(A) The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser within the District regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or\n\n(B) The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in the District and (i) the purchaser is the United States government, or (ii) the taxpayer is not taxable in the state of the purchaser.\n\n(A) For the tax years beginning after December 31, 2014, sales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in the District if the taxpayer’s market for the sales is in the District. The taxpayer’s market for sales is in the District:\n\n(i) In the case of sale, rental, lease, or license of real property, if and to the extent the property is located in the District;\n\n(ii) In the case of rental, lease, or license of tangible personal property, if and to the extent the property is located in the District;\n\n(iii) In the case of the sale of a service, if and to the extent the service is delivered to a location in the District; and\n\n(iv) In the case of intangible property:\n\n(I) That is rented, leased, or licensed, if and to the extent the property is used in the District; provided, that intangible property utilized in marketing a good or service to a consumer is used in the District if that good or service is purchased by a consumer who is in the District; and\n\n(II) That is sold, if and to the extent the property is used in the District; provided, that:\n\n(aa) A contract right, government license, or similar intangible property that authorizes the holder to conduct a business activity in a specific geographic area is used in the District if the geographic area includes all or part of the District;\n\n(bb) Receipts from intangible property sales that are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the intangible property shall be treated as receipts from the rental, lease, or licensing of such intangible property under sub-sub-subparagraph (I) of this sub-subparagraph; and\n\n(cc) All other receipts from a sale of intangible property shall be excluded from the numerator and denominator of the sales factor.\n\n(B) If the state or states of assignment under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph cannot be determined, the state or states of assignment shall be reasonably approximated.\n\n(C) If the taxpayer is not taxable in a state in which a sale is assigned under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, or if a state of assignment cannot be determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or reasonably approximated under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the sale shall be excluded from the denominator of the sales factor.\n\n(D) The Chief Financial Officer may issue rules to implement the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(h) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the District, the taxpayer may petition for or the Mayor may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:\n\n(1) Separate accounting;\n\n(2) The exclusion of any 1 or more of the factors;\n\n(3) The inclusion of 1 or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in the District; or\n\n(4) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.\n\n(i) For the purposes of this section, the term:\n\n(1) “State” shall include the District of Columbia.\n\n(2) “Business income” means all income which is apportionable under the Constitution of the United States.\n\n(j) This section shall be so construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states that enact it.",

Except when specifically required by the Chief Financial Officer to be included, all dividends paid by an insurance company directly or indirectly to a corporation that is part of a unitary business with the insurance company shall be deducted or eliminated from the income of the recipient of the dividend.\n\n(A) Except as otherwise provided by regulation, business income from an inter-company transaction between members of the same combined group shall be deferred in a manner similar to 26 CFR § 1.1502-13.\n\n(B) Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, deferred business income resulting from an inter-company transaction between members of a combined group shall be restored to the income of the seller and shall be apportioned as business income earned immediately before the event:\n\n(i) The object of a deferred inter-company transaction is:\n\n(I) Resold by the buyer to an entity that is not a member of the combined group;\n\n(II) Resold by the buyer to an entity that is a member of the combined group for use outside the unitary business in which the buyer and seller are engaged; or\n\n(III) Converted by the buyer to a use outside the unitary business in which the buyer and seller are engaged; or\n\n(ii) The buyer and seller are no longer members of the same combined group, regardless of whether the members remain unitary.\n\n(A) A charitable expense incurred by a member of a combined group shall, to the extent allowable as a deduction pursuant to section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, be subtracted first from the business income of the combined group, subject to the income limitations of that section applied to the entire business income of the group, and any remaining amount shall then be treated as a nonbusiness expense allocable to the member that incurred the expense, subject to the income limitations of that section applied to the nonbusiness income of that specific member.\n\n(B) Any charitable deduction disallowed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, but allowed as a carryover deduction in a subsequent year, shall be treated as originally incurred in the subsequent year by the same member, and the rules set forth in this section shall apply in the subsequent year in determining the allowable deduction in that year.\n\n(7) Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of capital assets, property described by section 1231(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and property subject to an involuntary conversion shall be removed from the total separate net income of each member of a combined group and shall be apportioned and allocated as follows:\n\n(A) For each class of gain or loss (short-term capital, long-term capital, section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and involuntary conversions) all members’ business gain and loss for the class shall be combined without netting between classes and each class of net business gain or loss separately apportioned to each member using the member’s apportionment percentage determined under § 47-1810.04.\n\n(B) Each taxpayer member shall then net its apportioned business gain or loss for all classes, including any such apportioned business gain and loss from other combined groups, against the taxpayer member’s nonbusiness gain and loss for all classes allocated to the District, using the rules of sections 1222 and 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, without regard to any of the taxpayer member’s gains or losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets, section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 property, and involuntary conversions that are nonbusiness items allocated to another state.\n\n(C) Any resulting District source income or loss, if the loss is not subject to the limitations of section 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, of a taxpayer member produced by the application of the preceding subparagraphs shall then be applied to all other District source income or loss of that member.\n\n(D) Any resulting District source loss of a member that is subject to the limitations of section 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be carried over by that member and shall be treated as District source short-term capital loss incurred by that member for the year for which the carryover applies.\n\n(8) Any expense of one member of the unitary group that is directly or indirectly attributable to the nonbusiness or exempt income of another member of the unitary group shall be allocated to that other member as a corresponding nonbusiness or exempt expense, as appropriate.",

To view the text of this section after the expiration of all emergency and temporary legislation affecting this section, click this link: Permanent Version.*\n\n(a) Whenever the Chief Financial Officer shall deem it necessary in order to satisfy the District’s claim for a tax payable by any foreign corporation or unincorporated business, it may, by rules and regulations, require any person subject to the jurisdiction of the District to withhold and pay to the Chief Financial Officer an amount not in excess of the highest applicable rate of tax set forth in § 47-1806.03 applied to all income payable by such person to such foreign corporation or unincorporated business. After such foreign corporation or unincorporated business shall have filed all returns required under this subchapter, and the same shall have been audited, the Chief Financial Officer shall refund any overpayment to the taxpayer.\n\n(1) Every employer making payment of wages on or after October 1, 1956, to any employee as defined in this chapter, shall deduct and withhold a tax upon such wages, such tax to be determined by one of the following methods, to be elected by the employer, subject to the approval of the Chief Financial Officer, with respect to any employee:\n\n(A) In accordance with a percentage method of withholding similar in principle to that under § 3402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (§ 3402 of Title 26, United States Code), to be included in regulations;\n\n(B) In accordance with tables similar in principle to those contained in § 3402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to be included in regulations;\n\n(C) Repealed; or\n\n(D) By such other method as may be prescribed in regulations.\n\n(1A) For the purposes of this subsection, the terms \"allowance\" and \"exemption\" shall have the same meaning.\n\n(A) If wages are paid with respect to a period which is not a payroll period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days, including Sundays and holidays, equal to the number of days in the period with respect to which such wages are paid.\n\n(B) In any case in which wages are paid by an employer without regard to any payroll period or other period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) which have elapsed since the date of the last payment of such wages by such employer during the calendar year, or the date of commencement of employment with such employer during such year, or January 1st of such year, whichever is the later.\n\n(C) In determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under this section, the wages may, at the election of the employer, be computed to the nearest dollar.\n\n(D) The Chief Financial Officer may, by regulations, authorize employers:\n\n(i) To estimate the wages which will be paid to any employee in any quarter of the calendar year;\n\n(ii) To determine the amount to be deducted and withheld upon each payment of wages to such employee during such quarter as if the appropriate average of the wages so estimated constituted the actual wages paid; and\n\n(iii) To deduct and withhold upon any payment of wages to such employee during such quarter such amount as may be necessary to adjust the amount actually deducted and withheld upon the wages of such employee during such quarter to the amount that would be required to be deducted and withheld during such quarter if the payroll period of the employee were quarterly.\n\n(E) [Repealed].\n\n(1) If payment of wages is made to an employee by an employer:\n\n(A) With respect to a payroll period or other period, any part of which is included in a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to such employee by such employer;\n\n(B) Without regard to any payroll period or other period, but on or prior to the expiration of a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to such employee by such employer;\n\n(C) With respect to a period beginning in 1 and ending in another calendar year; or\n\n(D) Through an agent, fiduciary, or other person who also has the control, receipt, custody, or disposal of, or pays the wages payable by another employer to such employee.\n\n(2) The manner of withholding and the amount to be deducted and withheld under this section shall be determined in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Chief Financial Officer under which the withholding exemption allowed to the employee in any calendar year shall approximate the withholding exemption allowable with respect to an annual payroll period.\n\n(d) If the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during one-half or more of any payroll period of not more than 31 consecutive days constitutes wages, all the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages; but if the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during more than one-half of any such payroll period does not constitute wages, then none of the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages.\n\n(1) An employee receiving wages shall on any day be entitled to the withholding exemptions allowed under this chapter, unless the Chief Financial Officer determines that an alternative withholding method is warranted under paragraphs (9) or (11) of this subsection.\n\n(2) Every employee shall, on or before October 1, 1956, or before the date of commencement of employment, whichever is later, furnish his employer with a signed withholding exemption certificate relating to the withholding exemptions which he claims, which in no event shall exceed the number to which he is entitled.\n\n(3) Withholding exemption certificates shall take effect as of the beginning of the first payroll period ending, or the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period, on or after the date on which such certificate is so furnished; provided, that certificates furnished before October 1, 1956, shall be considered as furnished on that date.\n\n(4) A withholding exemption certificate which takes effect under this section shall continue in effect with respect to the employer until another such certificate takes effect under this section. If a withholding exemption certificate is furnished to take the place of an existing certificate, the employer, at his option, may continue the old certificate in force with respect to all wages paid on or before the first status determination date, January 1st or July 1st of each year, which occurs at least 30 days after the date on which such new certificate is furnished.\n\n(5) If, on any day during the calendar year, the withholding exemptions to which the employee may reasonably be expected to be entitled at the beginning of his next taxable year is different from the exemptions to which the employee is entitled on such day, the employee shall in such cases and at such times as the Chief Financial Officer may prescribe, furnish the employer with a withholding exemption certificate relating to the exemptions which he claims with respect to such next taxable year, which shall in no event exceed the exemptions to which he may reasonably be expected to be so entitled. Exemption certificates issued pursuant to this subsection shall not take effect with respect to any payment of wages made in the calendar year in which the certificate is furnished.\n\n(6) If, on any day during the calendar year, the withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is less than the withholding exemptions claimed by the employee on the withholding exemption certificate then in effect with respect to him, the employee shall, within 10 days thereafter, furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate relating to the withholding exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the exemptions to which he is entitled on such day. If, on any day during the calendar year, the withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is greater than the withholding exemptions claimed, the employee may furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate relating to the withholding exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the exemptions to which he is entitled on such day.\n\n(7) Withholding exemption certificates shall be in such form and contain such information as the Chief Financial Officer may by regulations prescribe.\n\n(8) For periods beginning after December 31, 2011, an employee shall be entitled to additional withholding exemptions under this subsection with respect to payment of wages equal to a number determined by dividing by $1,370 his or her estimated itemized deductions.\n\n(8A) For periods beginning after December 31, 2017, an employee shall be entitled to additional withholding exemptions under this subsection with respect to payment of wages equal to the employee's estimated itemized deductions divided by an amount promulgated by the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n(9) An employer shall base withholding for the employee on zero withholding exemptions if the Chief Financial Officer notifies an employer that:\n\n(A) An employee has an unpaid tax liability;\n\n(B) An employee failed to file a required District of Columbia income tax return; or\n\n(C) An employee is subject to a tax refund interception request.\n\n(10) If the conditions of paragraphs (9)(A), (B), and (C) of this subsection no longer apply, the employer may apply to the Chief Financial Officer to authorize an increase in the number of withholding exemptions. Upon approval, the Chief Financial Officer may authorize an increase in the number of withholding exemptions to the level at which they would not have resulted in an underpayment of taxpayer’s most recent income tax return.\n\n(A) An exemption certificate shall be invalid if it:\n\n(i) Does not contain the information required; or\n\n(ii) Contains false or fraudulent information.\n\n(B) An exemption certificate shall be valid if it states:\n\n(i) A number of exemptions if it is less than the number of exemptions to which the individual is entitled under this chapter; or\n\n(ii) A number of additional exemptions less than or equal to the fraction rounded down to the nearest whole number:\n\n(I) The numerator of which equals the excess of the total of estimated itemized deductions, alimony payments, allowable child care expenses, qualified retirement contributions, business losses, and employer business expenses over the standard deduction allowance; and\n\n(II) The denominator of which equals the amount allowed for each exemption under this chapter for the applicable tax year.\n\n(1) Any sum or sums withheld in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be, and shall be, held in trust by the employer for the District of Columbia.\n\n(2) The District of Columbia shall have a lien upon all the property of any employer who fails to withhold or pay over to the Chief Financial Officer sums required to be withheld under this section. If the employer withholds but fails to pay over the amounts withheld to the Chief Financial Officer the lien shall accrue on the date the amounts were withheld. If the employer fails to withhold, the lien shall accrue on the date the amounts were required to be withheld. The liens referred to in this paragraph shall constitute a preferred claim, having priority over all other liens or security interests of whatever kind and however created. If property of an employer is seized under distraint provisions, neither the United States Marshal, nor a receiver, assignee or any other officer shall sell the property without first determining from the Chief Financial Officer the amounts due and payable by said employer, and if there be any amounts due, owing or unpaid, it shall be the duty of such officer to first pay to the Chief Financial Officer the said amounts out of the proceeds of such sale before making any payment to any judgment creditor or other claimants of whatsoever kind or nature.\n\n(A) Every person required to deduct and withhold from an employee a tax under this section, or who would have been required to deduct and withhold a tax under this section if the employee had claimed no more than 1 withholding exemption, shall furnish to each such employee in respect to the wages paid by such person to such employee during the calendar year, on or before January 31st of the succeeding year, or, if his employment is terminated before the close of such calendar year, on the day on which the last payment of wages is made, a written statement showing the following:\n\n(i) The name and address of such person;\n\n(ii) The name and address of the employee and his social security account number;\n\n(iii) The total amount of wages as defined in this chapter; and\n\n(iv) The total amount deducted and withheld as tax under this section.\n\n(B) The statement required to be furnished by this subsection in respect of any wages shall be furnished at such other times, shall contain such other information, and shall be in such form, as the Chief Financial Officer may by regulation prescribe.\n\n(2) The Chief Financial Officer may promulgate regulations providing for reasonable extensions of time, not in excess of 30 days, to employers required to furnish statements under this subsection.\n\n(h) An employer shall be liable for the payment of tax required to be deducted and withheld under this section. Such tax shall be paid to the Chief Financial Officer and shall not be paid to any other person.\n\n(1) Every person residing or domiciled in the District at the times prescribed in paragraph (4) of this subsection shall, at these times, make declaration of his or her estimated tax for the taxable year if the person can reasonably be expected to receive gross income not subject to the withholding provisions of this section that will result in a tax liability of more than $100. This requirement shall not apply to any elective officer of the government of the United States, or any employee on the staff of an elected officer in the legislative branch of the government of the United States if the employee is a bona fide resident of the state of residence of the elected officer, or any officer of the executive branch of the government whose appointment to the office held by him or her was by the President of the United States, and subject to confirmation by the Senate of the United States, and whose tenure of office is at the pleasure of the President of the United States, or any Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States unless the officers or Justices are domiciled within the District at any time during the taxable year.\n\n(2) In the declaration required under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the individual shall state:\n\n(A) The amount which he estimates as the amount of income tax due under this chapter for the taxable year;\n\n(B) The amount which he estimates as the credit for tax withheld for the taxable year under this chapter;\n\n(C) The excess of the amount estimated under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph over the amount estimated under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, which excess for purposes of this section shall be considered the estimated tax for the taxable year; and\n\n(D) Such other information as may be prescribed in regulations promulgated by the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n(3) In the case of married individuals (or domestic partner who filed under § 47-1805.01(f)), a single declaration under this section may be made by them jointly, in which case the liability with respect to the estimated tax shall be joint and several. No joint declaration may be made if the married individuals are separated under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance (or domestic partner who filed under § 47-1805.01(f) has terminated the domestic partnership in accordance with § 32-702(d)), or if they have different taxable years. If a joint declaration is made but a joint return is not made for the taxable year, the estimated tax for such year may be treated as the estimated tax of either spouse (or domestic partner who filed under § 47-1805.01(f)), or may be divided between them.\n\n(4) The declaration required under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be filed with the Chief Financial Officer on or before April 15th of the taxable year, except that if the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection are first met: (A) after April 1st and before June 2nd of the taxable year, the declaration shall be filed on or before June 15th of the taxable year; (B) after June 1st and before September 2nd of the taxable year, the declaration shall be filed on or before September 15th of the taxable year; or (C) after September 1st of the taxable year, the declaration shall be filed on or before January 15th of the succeeding taxable year; provided, that the declaration required to be filed during 1956 may be filed not later than October 15, 1956, if the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection are fulfilled at any time prior to October 1, 1956.\n\n(5) An individual may make amendments of a declaration filed during the taxable year under this subsection, under regulations prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n(6) If on or before January 15th of the succeeding taxable year the taxpayer files a return for the taxable year for which the declaration is required and pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable, then under regulations prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer:\n\n(A) If the declaration is not required to be filed during the taxable year, but is required to be filed on or before such January 15th, such return shall, for the purposes of this section, be considered as such declaration; and\n\n(B) If the tax shown on the return, reduced by the credits under this chapter, is greater than the estimated tax shown in a declaration previously made or, in the last amendment thereof, such return shall, for the purposes of this section, be considered as the amendment of the declaration permitted by this subsection to be filed on or before such January 15th.\n\n(7) The Chief Financial Officer may promulgate regulations governing reasonable extensions of time for filing declarations and paying the estimated tax. Except in the case of taxpayers who are abroad, no such extensions shall be for more than 6 months.\n\n(8) If the taxpayer is unable to make his own declaration, the declaration shall be made by a duly authorized agent or by the guardian or other person charged with the care of the person or property of such taxpayer.\n\n(9) The provisions of § 47-1805.04 shall apply to a declaration of estimated tax.\n\n(10) Payment of the estimated tax, or any installment thereof, shall be considered payment on account of the tax for the taxable year.\n\n(j) One-half of the liability for the income tax imposed by this chapter for the calendar year 1956, or the fiscal year of a taxpayer beginning during such calendar year, upon any resident of the District (other than fiduciaries) shall be discharged. The remainder of the total amount of the income tax due as shown on the taxpayer’s return shall be paid to the Collector on the 15th of April, 1957, or if the return be made on the basis of a fiscal year the remainder of the total amount of such tax shall be paid on the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the fiscal year.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, interest shall be assessed on deficiencies and late payments of income tax withheld or required to be withheld at source by an employer as provided for in this section at the rate set forth in § 47-4201 or fraction thereof from the date prescribed for payment of the tax until paid.\n\n(1) For the purposes of this subsection, the term:\n\n(A) “Constructive receipt” or “constructively received” means that payments of lottery winnings, although not actually within a taxpayer’s possession, are deemed to be received by the payee and subject to District tax in the taxable year during which the lottery winner is determined by Powerball or other lottery drawing.\n\n(B) “Lottery winnings” means winnings which are subject to withholding as defined in section 3402(q) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, whether as a lump sum or annuitized payment.\n\n(C) “Payment” means the payment of lottery winnings.\n\n(D) “Payor” means a person responsible to make a payment subject to withholding under section 3402(q) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n(2) In making payments, whether actually or constructively received by the payee, of lottery winnings taxable under § 47-1803.02, [§] 47-1807.02, or [§] 47-1808.02, the District of Columbia Lottery and Charitable Games Control Board, or any payor, shall deduct and withhold from such payments an amount equal to the tax on such payments computed at the highest rate of tax under § 47-1806.03, [§] 47-1807.02, or [§] 47-1808.03, as applicable, in accordance with procedures to be established by the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n(3) Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the withholding required by this section shall apply to any of the following payments:\n\n(A) A lump sum payment in the year the payment is made; or\n\n(B) A payment of an annuitized amount in the year the payment is made by any payor to a payee.\n\n(4) The withholding required by this subsection shall not apply to a payment to a nonresident, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company if the individual, shareholder, partner, or member of such entities provides the payor with a statement and documentary evidence, subject to review and approval by the Chief Financial Officer, that the income earned is not subject to District tax.\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if a resident payee receives a payment from a retirement plan or retirement account that is a lump-sum distribution, District income tax shall be withheld on the lump-sum distribution by the payor at the highest District individual income tax rate that is in effect at the time of the distribution.\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to:\n\n(A) Any portion of a lump-sum payment that was previously subject to tax;\n\n(B) An eligible rollover distribution that is effected as a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer; or\n\n(C) A rollover from an individual retirement account to a traditional or Roth individual retirement account that is effected as a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term:\n\n(A) “Lump-sum distribution” means a payment from a payor to a resident payee of the resident payee’s entire account balance, exclusive of any other tax withholding and any administrative charges and fees.\n\n(B) “Retirement account” or “retirement plan” means:\n\n(i) A qualified employee plan;\n\n(ii) A qualified employee annuity plan;\n\n(iii) A defined contribution plan;\n\n(iv) A defined benefit plan;\n\n(v) A tax-sheltered annuity plan;\n\n(vi) An individual retirement account;\n\n(vii) Any combination of the plans and account listed in sub-subparagraphs (i) through (vi) of this subparagraph;
