Such document shall cross-reference the original notarized certificate of assignment or sale and transfer issued by the Department of Finance and Revenue and shall recite the information appearing on such original certificate.\n\n(3) Evidence of any subsequent transfer and assignment shall be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds.\n\n(j) The assignee, purchaser, or transferee of a tax lien, any successor thereof, shall be subject to applicable tenant protection provisions of § 42-3401.01 et seq. and § 42-3501.01 et seq. or any other applicable District law.\n\n(k) The Mayor may issue rules to implement the provisions of this section.\n\n(l) The powers granted under this section shall be exercised from time to time by that official delegated authority pursuant to § 1-204.24a.\n\n(m) For a period of not more than 6 months following the completion of the transaction, the District shall have the right to substitute a lien of equal value for similar property, where the district has determined that a particular property should be excluded from the tax lien portfolio.",
