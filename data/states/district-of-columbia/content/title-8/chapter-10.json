Any waste water directed to a municipal water treatment plant shall conform with all applicable local and federal pre-treatment standards. The tires of trucks or other facility vehicles that use public roads shall be cleaned in the tire cleaning area before the trucks or other vehicles may exit the facility.\n\n(9) Each existing solid waste facility shall continuously abate for disease vectors within a 4 block radius of the site, or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department of Health, Environmental Health Administration and the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs that the facility is not providing vector harborage. The owner or operator of the solid waste facility shall provide reasonable notice to the community and seek permission to conduct abatement activities on all private properties within the 4 block radius before commencing abatement. Bait and traps shall not be placed on private property without the consent of the owner or occupant of the property.

The shipment shall be secured to prevent access by unauthorized personnel, isolated from the main waste handling areas, and held in a manner to protect it from the elements, vermin, or other disease vectors and to prevent it from contaminating the solid waste handling facility or the surrounding community.\n\n(17) The solid waste facility shall dispose of the hazardous, infectious or radioactive hazardous waste or shall direct the transporter to dispose of the wastes as outlined in its inspection, monitoring and control plan or as otherwise ordered by the Department of Health, immediately after inspection by the Department of Health or notification that it will not inspect the shipment. In no event shall the hazardous, infectious or radioactive hazardous waste remain on site for more than 24 hours.\n\n(18) The solid waste facility shall provide a summary of its inspection activities in monthly reports to the Department of Health.
