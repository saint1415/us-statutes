Law 19-191, effective October 23, 2012, and applicable October 1, 2013], the Mayor shall issue rules to implement the provisions of that amendatory act [D.C.

In the case of a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, used in accordance with the label claim and recommendations, physical or physiological effects on plants or parts thereof shall not be deemed to be injury, when such effects are the purpose for which the plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant was applied.\n\n(f) If the pesticide or device is condemned, it shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may direct, and the proceeds, if sold, less the court costs, shall be paid into the District Treasury and credited to the general fund; provided, that the pesticide or device shall not be sold contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the FIFRA, or the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is sold; provided further, that upon payment of the costs of the condemnation proceedings and the execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond conditioned upon assurances that the pesticide shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of contrary to the provisions of this subchapter, the FIFRA, or the laws of any jurisdiction in which it is sold, the court may direct that such pesticide or device be delivered to the owner thereof. The proceedings of such condemnation cases shall conform, as near as may be to the proceedings used for the condemnation of insanitary buildings under § 6-903.\n\n(g) When a decree of condemnation is entered against the pesticide or device, court costs and fees, storage, and other proper expenses shall be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the pesticide or device.\n\n(h) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the District to prosecute or institute other proceedings for minor violations of the chapter whenever the Mayor believes that the public interest will be best served by a suitable notice in writing to the alleged violator.\n\n(i) The Mayor may bring an action to enjoin the violation or threatened violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation made pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(j) In order to comply with section 4 of the FIFRA [7 U.S.C. § 136b], the Mayor is authorized to make such reports to the Environmental Protection Agency in the form and containing the information as the Administrator may from time to time require.",
