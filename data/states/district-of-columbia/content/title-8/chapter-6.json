The standards may rely on engineering or institutional controls protective of public health, welfare and the environment. DDOE may designate and publish the particular engineering controls it deems as protective of public health, welfare and the environment in specified circumstances; and may designate the circumstances as containing presumptive remedies, taking into account the type of hazardous substances on the contaminated property and the proposed use of the property. Applicants claiming presumptive remedies shall not be required to conduct a risk assessment prior to the approval of a cleanup action plan.\n\n(b) Until the cleanup standards required by subsection (a) of this section are adopted, the following guidelines shall apply to voluntary cleanup actions:\n\n(1) The maximum contaminant levels established pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, approved December 16, 1974 (88 Stat. 1660; 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq.) shall be the cleanup standard for groundwater;\n\n(2) The cleanup standards established by DDOE based on the District’s environmental policy, law, or regulations in effect prior to June 13, 2001, shall apply to hazardous substances in any other media apart from groundwater; and\n\n(3) For hazardous substances in any media apart from groundwater, for which interim cleaning standards cannot be determined pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the cleanup standards established by the application of risk assessment regulations of the District’s leaking underground storage tank program shall apply.",
