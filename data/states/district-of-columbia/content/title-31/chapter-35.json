The total amount of premiums for insured risk shall not include premiums collected for federal health benefit programs that have a separate reserve fund held by the federal government.\n\n(b) The surplus requirement of 8.0% shall be phased-in following April 9, 1997 as follows:\n\n(1) Year one — 40% of the surplus requirement in subsection (a) of this section;\n\n(2) Year two — 60% of the surplus requirement in subsection (a) of this section;\n\n(3) Year three — 80% of the surplus requirement in subsection (a) of this section; and\n\n(4) Year four — 100% of the surplus requirement in subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(c) The Mayor shall have the authority to require the differentiation of the corporation’s activities into risk and nonrisk business for the purpose of determining the corporation’s income that is derived from premiums for insured risk and from other sources.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, at the time of issuance of a certificate of authority under this chapter and at all times thereafter, a corporation shall be subject to the provisions of any risk-based capital regulations for hospital and medical services corporations promulgated by the Mayor, and must maintain at all times such surplus as is determined to be necessary under those regulations.\n\n(e) The Commissioner may, on an annual basis, and shall, on a basis no less frequently than every 3 years, review the portion of the surplus of the corporation that is attributable to the District and may issue a determination as to whether the surplus is excessive. Any such review shall be undertaken in coordination with the other jurisdictions in which the corporation conducts business. The surplus may be considered excessive only if:\n\n(1) The surplus is greater than the appropriate risk-based capital requirements as determined by the Commissioner for the immediately preceding calendar year; and\n\n(2) After a hearing, the Commissioner determines that the surplus is unreasonably large and inconsistent with the corporation’s obligation under § 31-3505.01.\n\n(f) In determining whether the surplus of the corporation that is attributable to the District is excessive, the Commissioner shall take into account all of the corporation’s financial obligations arising in connection with the conduct of the corporation’s insurance business, including premium tax paid and the corporation’s contribution to the open enrollment program required by § 31-3514 and payments and expenditures pursuant to a public-private partnership.\n\n(1) If the Commissioner determines that the surplus of the corporation is excessive, the Commissioner shall order the corporation to submit a plan for dedication of the excess to community health reinvestment in a fair and equitable manner.\n\n(2) A plan submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection may consist entirely of expenditures for the benefit of current subscribers of the corporation.\n\n(h) When determining what surplus is attributable to the District and whether the surplus is excessive, the Commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or other professionals, the cost of which shall be borne by the corporation.\n\n(i) If the Commissioner determines that the corporation failed to submit a plan as ordered under subsection (g) of this section within a reasonable period or failed to execute within a reasonable period a plan already submitted under subsection (g) of this section, the Commissioner shall deny for 12 months all premium rate increases for subscriber policies written in the District sought by the corporation pursuant to § 31-3508 and may issue such orders as are necessary to enforce the purposes of this chapter.\n\n(j) The existence of a public-private partnership shall not preclude the Commissioner’s surplus evaluation of the corporation or diminish the Commissioner’s authority to issue directives to the corporation pursuant to the evaluation.",

When, in the Mayor’s opinion, a filing is not accompanied by the information needed to support it and the Mayor does not have sufficient information to determine whether the filing meets the requirements of this section, a corporation shall be required to furnish the needed information. In such event the waiting period shall be suspended and shall recommence as of the date the information is furnished. Upon written application by the corporation, the Mayor may authorize a filing which the Mayor has reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period or any extension thereof, or at any later date. A filing shall be deemed approved unless disapproved by the Mayor within the waiting period or any extension thereof requested by the corporation.\n\n(b) All rates for individual subscriber contracts issued in the District of Columbia shall be subject to the prior approval of the Mayor.

In such event, the waiting period shall be suspended and shall recommence as of the date the information is furnished.

If not disapproved before the expiration of the review period or any extension thereof requested by the corporation, the filing shall be deemed approved. Any disapproval under this subsection shall be applied retrospectively to the date the corporation made such rates effective. Upon application by the corporation, the Mayor may affirmatively approve a filing prior to the end of the review period. All approved rate filings for group subscriber contracts, other than experience rated groups, submitted in other jurisdictions shall be filed with the Mayor for information purposes only.\n\n(1) Application for approval shall be made to the Mayor in the format, and with the information, that the Mayor requires.\n\n(2) The Mayor may, at any time, require any corporation issued a certificate of authority under this chapter to demonstrate that its filings, including the terms and provisions of its subscriber contract forms, its rates, and its method for setting rates, are in compliance with this section, notwithstanding that the filings then in effect had previously been approved by the Mayor. Any subscriber contract forms and rates previously approved by the Mayor, but subsequently disapproved under this section, shall be considered disapproved on a prospective basis only from the date of such notice of disapproval, unless the corporation made a material misrepresentation in its contract form or rate filings.\n\n(3) If at any time subsequent to the applicable waiting or review period provided for in this section, the Mayor finds that a filing does not meet the requirements of this section, the Mayor shall issue an order to the filer specifying in what respects the Mayor finds that the filing fails to meet the requirements of this section, and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the filing shall be no longer effective. The order shall not affect any subscriber contract, group certificate, or other contract made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the order. However, the Mayor may, prior to issuing the order and if requested by the filer, hold a hearing upon not less than 10 days written notice to the filer specifying the matters to be considered at the hearing.\n\n(1) Rate filings shall be inclusive of all rates, rating plans, and other documents utilized by a corporation to determine rates.\n\n(2) Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory in relation to the services and benefits offered.\n\n(3) In determining whether to disapprove a rate filing, the Mayor shall give due consideration to past and prospective loss experience within and outside the District of Columbia, to underwriting practice and judgment to the extent appropriate, to a reasonable margin for surplus needs, to past and prospective expenses both nationwide and within the District of Columbia, and to all other relevant factors within and outside the District of Columbia. In establishing the rates to be charged individuals with open enrollment subscriber contracts, including individual conversion subscriber contracts, the revenue which would have been otherwise collected by the District of Columbia government through the imposition of the 1% premium tax pursuant to § 31-3514(j), but which a corporation has contributed to a Rate Stabilization Fund in accordance with § 31-3514(j)(1), shall be credited by the corporation to the benefit of this class of subscribers in an amount which assures competitive rates.\n\n(4) A corporation filing a rate pursuant to this section shall also comply with the Reasonable Health Insurance Ratemaking Reform Act of 2010 [D.C.
