      "text": "(a) The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:\n\n(1) Motorists, motor vehicle passengers, and pedestrians in the District are not adequately protected, by current law and practice, from the consequences of motor vehicle accidents.\n\n(2) If a person suffers personal injuries because of an accident involving a motor vehicle in the District, he or she is unlikely to recover the amount of his or her actual losses because:\n\n(A) Approximately 50% of the victims do not satisfy the prerequisites to compensation under the present law;\n\n(B) Approximately 40% of the operators in the District do not maintain any motor vehicle insurance or have other financial resources sufficient to pay losses;\n\n(C) The average motor vehicle insurance policy in the District will pay only up to $10,000 for the personal injuries of any 1 victim, a sum that is insufficient to compensate adequately a victim with serious injuries; and\n\n(D) Satisfaction of the prerequisites to compensation under the present law is time-consuming and expensive to policyholders because a victim must establish that the accident was the fault of another person; that the person injured was free from contributory fault; and that the injuries suffered were the natural and probable consequences of the accident.\n\n(3) Far greater protection to victims of motor vehicle accidents is available at a lower price than that afforded for coverage currently available.\n\n(4) The purchase of this better insurance protection should be compulsory because of the great potential of a motor vehicle to cause personal injury.\n\n(b) It is the purpose of this chapter to provide adequate protection for victims who are injured in the District or who are injured while riding in motor vehicles registered or operated in the District.",

The plan shall provide for suitable apportionment, by the manager or committee designated to operate the plan, among insurers of applicants for any of the insurance who are unable to obtain insurance reasonably through ordinary methods.\n\n(B) When a plan has been approved by the Commissioner, all insurers authorized to sell motor vehicle insurance in the District shall subscribe thereto, cooperate therewith, and participate therein; provided, however, that no insurer shall be required to quote plan rates to applicants for voluntary insurance or to seek waivers from the plan before selling such voluntary insurance.\n\n(C) Any applicant for a policy, any named beneficiary or insured under a policy issued pursuant to the plan, and any insurer may appeal to the Commissioner from any decision of the manager or committee designated to operate the plan.\n\n(D) Each insurer selling motor vehicle insurance in the District shall be required to offer insurance which shall provide at least all minimum benefits required by this chapter with respect to: (i) property damage liability; (ii) third-party personal liability; and (iii) uninsured motorist protection. In addition, each insurer shall offer optional personal injury protection insurance required by § 31-2404 and underinsured motor vehicle coverage as required by this section. Taxicab insurers and self-insurers shall be exempt from the requirement to offer optional personal injury protection insurance.

Once an insured has rejected this underinsured motor vehicle coverage the insurer does not have to reoffer it. The insurer shall not be required to obtain or maintain written rejections of the underinsured motor vehicle coverage. The benefits provided by the underinsured motor vehicle coverage shall be subject to the same provisions as denials or exclusions of coverages, insolvency, subrogation, and set-off as provided in the uninsured motorist coverage.

If personal injury protection benefits are not paid within 30 days after receipt of such proof, the payment is overdue.\n\n(2) An overdue payment of personal injury protection benefits bears interest at the prime rate of interest generally prevailing in the District on the date upon which such payment is first overdue per annum from the date upon which such payment is first overdue.\n\n(3) For purposes of this subsection, payment is made on the date a draft or other valid commercial instrument is placed in the United States mail in a properly addressed and posted envelope or on the date of delivery thereof, whichever is applicable.\n\n(d) An agreement for the assignment of a right to any personal injury protection benefits payable in the future is void.\n\n(1) An attorney may receive a reasonable fee for advising and representing a claimant in an action for personal injury protection benefits which are overdue. The fee shall be paid by the applicable insurer in addition to the amount of the personal injury protection benefits which are overdue and the penalty under subsection (c) of this section if a court finds that the insurer did not promptly pay the amount due.\n\n(2) An insurer may be allowed, by a court, an award of a reasonable sum for a fee for its attorney for the legal cost of defending against a claim that is or was fraudulent in some significant respect. The award may be treated as an offset against the amount of any personal injury protection benefits then or thereafter owing by that insurer to the person making that claim.\n\n(f) Repealed.",

If the applicable insurer makes any payment of benefits for personal injury protection with respect to a particular victim and injury, then a civil action may be commenced at any time within 3 years after the most recent payment.\n\n(1) If a person’s physical or mental condition is material to any claim that has been made or that may be made for personal injury protection benefits, the person involved shall submit to physical or mental examination by physicians, in accordance with provisions of the policy of insurance pursuant to which a claim has been or may be made. A policy of insurance providing for payment of the benefits required for personal injury protection may include reasonable provisions for physical and mental examination of persons claiming any such benefits.\n\n(A) If requested by the person examined, a copy of every written report concerning an examination under this subsection which is made by an examining physician shall be delivered or mailed to such person without charge.\n\n(B) At least 1 report shall set forth in detail the findings and conclusions of the examining physicians.\n\n(C) Upon request and delivery or mailing, the party causing a person to be examined under this subsection may request the person examined to furnish its representative with a copy of every written report available to that person concerning any examination which is relevant to that person’s claim for personal injury protection benefits.\n\n(D) An applicable insurer may request a person claiming personal injury protection benefits to submit the name and address of each physician, medical-care facility, hospital, clinic, rehabilitation center, nursing facility, or other person or institution that has diagnosed or treated the victim for or with respect to the injury claimed and any relevant past injury, as a prerequisite to the payment of benefits under this chapter.\n\n(E) A person shall authorize an insurer to inspect and copy records relevant to such a claim which are prepared or maintained by any physician, hospital, clinic, rehabilitation center, nursing facility, or other person or institution.\n\n(3) A court may make any order which is just in case a person refuses to comply with any provision of paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, except that an order shall not be entered directing the arrest of a person for disobeying an order to submit to a physical or mental examination.\n\n(4) Nothing contained in this subsection shall preclude a victim from obtaining treatment by the victim’s own physician.\n\n(1) Payment of personal injury protection benefits by an insurer in good faith to or for the benefit of a person believed to be entitled thereto discharges the insurer from its obligation to the extent of the amount of such payment, unless such insurer has been notified in writing prior to the payment of the claim of some other person.\n\n(2) If there is doubt about the proper person to receive the benefits involved or the proper apportionment to be made among the persons entitled to benefits or about whether an item of medical or rehabilitation expense was reasonably necessary or whether the charge for an item is reasonable, the insurer, the claimant, or any other interested person may apply to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for an appropriate order. If an application is made by an insurer before the benefit claimed is overdue, the provisions of § 31-2410(c) and (e) are not applicable with respect to the amount.\n\n(1) An insurer shall have a right of reimbursement from any other insurer, based upon a determination of fault, for any personal injury protection benefits paid or obligated to be paid by that insurer as a result of an accident that involved 2 or more motor vehicles, at least 1 of which was of a type other than a passenger motor vehicle.\n\n(2) An insurer which has paid or become obligated to pay personal injury protection benefits in any case not covered by paragraph (1) of this subsection may agree to receive a right of reimbursement from any other insurer with respect to some or all of those benefits.\n\n(3) Entitlement to reimbursement and the amount of any reimbursement under this subsection shall be determined by agreement between any insurers who are involved under paragraph (1) of this subsection or who agree under paragraph (2) of this subsection. If the insurers fail to reach agreement as to entitlement or amount or both, these issues shall be determined by intercompany arbitration in accordance with any applicable agreement between the insurers involved under procedures established by the Commissioner.

The Mayor shall gradually increase minimum liability insurance requirements for taxicabs during the waiver period, after hearings held in accordance with § 2-509.\n\n(2) The rate of increase will be determined by the Mayor based upon evidence submitted to the Mayor on the reasonableness of the insurance rate and liability limit increase in relation to the need to preserve the economic viability of the taxi industry.\n\n(3) The Mayor shall impose the liability limits and rate increases on an annual basis.\n\n(4) Two years from March 4, 1986, the owners and operators of taxis shall be required to obtain mandatory insurance as set forth in § 31-2406.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section shall preclude the owner or operator of a taxi from carrying insurance greater than the required minimum or from carrying at his or her option personal injury protection benefits.\n\n(f) The Mayor, the Director, or the Commissioner, or each of them, may, in accordance with § 2-509, issue rules to expeditiously and economically administer this chapter.",
