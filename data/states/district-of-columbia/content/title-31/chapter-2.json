The Commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of a company or association that fails to pay premium tax on or before the due date.\n\n(4) Each insurance company and association transacting business in the District whose District premium tax liability for the preceding calendar year was $1,000 or more shall remit on or before June 1, on a prepayment basis, an amount equal to one-half of the premium tax liability for the preceding calendar year. The sums prepaid by a company or association under this subsection shall be allowed as credits against its premium tax liability for the calendar year during which the payments are made. If a prepayment made under this subsection exceeds the annual premium tax liability, the excess shall be allowed as a credit against subsequent prepayment or tax liabilities. The Commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of a company or association that fails to make a prepayment on or before the due date.\n\n(c) A hospital service corporation or medical service corporation may deduct, up to $550,000, the corporation’s payment to the rate stabilization fund under § 31-3514 and payments and expenditures pursuant to a public-private partnership entered into in accordance with Chapter 35 of this title from the amount otherwise due by the corporation under subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(d) The Commissioner shall determine whether or not the tax remitted is correct.
