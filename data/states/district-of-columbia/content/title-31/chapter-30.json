In any such action, the court may grant such injunctive relief as the court may consider proper.\n\n(c) If major medical insurance or insurance providing major medical type benefits is discontinued, the Commissioner shall order that an extended benefit shall be provided during total disability, with respect to the sickness, injury, or pregnancy which caused the disability, of at least 18 months subsequent to the discontinuance of the insurance unless similar coverage is afforded for the total disability under another group plan.",
