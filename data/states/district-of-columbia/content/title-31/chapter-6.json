Suit to recover such profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the company, or by the owner of any security of the company in the name and in behalf of the company if the company shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within 60 days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter; but no such suit shall be brought more than 2 years after the date such profit was realized. This section shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security involved, or any transaction or transactions which the Council of the District of Columbia by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this section.\n\n(c) It shall be unlawful for any such beneficial owner, director, or officer, directly or indirectly, to sell any equity security of such company if the person selling the security or his principal: (1) does not own the security sold; or (2) if owning the security, does not deliver it against such sale within 20 days thereafter, or does not within 5 days after such sale deposit it in the mails or other usual channels of transportation; but no person shall be deemed to have violated this section if he proves that, notwithstanding the exercise of good faith, he was unable to make such delivery or deposit within such time, or that to do so would cause undue inconvenience or expense.\n\n(d) The provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to any purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, and the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to any sale, of an equity security of a domestic stock insurance company not then or theretofore held by him in an investment account, by a dealer in the ordinary course of his business and incident to the establishment or maintenance by him of a primary or secondary market (otherwise than on an exchange as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) for such security.

No provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule or regulation of the Council notwithstanding that such rule or regulation may, after such act or omission, be amended or rescinded or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.\n\n(i) Any person who willfully violates any provision of this section, or any rule or regulation thereunder, the violation of which is made unlawful by this section or the observance of which is required under the terms of this section, or any person who willfully and knowingly makes, or causes to be made, any statement in any application, report, or document required to be filed under this section, which statement was false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall upon conviction be fined not more than $1,000, or be imprisoned not more than 30 days, or both. Civil fines, penalties, and fees may be imposed as alternative sanctions for any infraction of the provisions of this chapter, or any rules or regulations issued under the authority of this chapter, pursuant to Chapter 18 of Title 2.
