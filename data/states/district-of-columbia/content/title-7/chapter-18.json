The Corporation may enter into the Purchase Agreement or the Residual Bond Purchase Agreement and may perform any acts necessary or convenient to effectuate its purposes, including financing the costs of the National Capital Medical Center indebtedness of the District, to finance or refinance the National Capital Medical Center, healthcare related issues, or other capital projects or undertakings of the District, or other capital projects, repayment, refinancing, or defeasance of certain indebtedness issued for capital projects and other undertakings.\n\n(1) Pursuant to § 1-204.90, subject to the restrictions of this subchapter, the Council delegates to the Corporation the power to issue revenue bonds, notes, and other obligations, including refunding revenue bonds at or before maturity, to finance or refinance, or assist in the financing or refinancing of the National Capital Medical Center, healthcare related issues, or other capital projects or undertakings of the District, which obligations shall be payable solely from, and secured by, the payments under the Master Settlement Agreement sold under § 7-1831.02, including the power to provide for the authorization, securing, sale, and issuance of the Bonds consistent with this subchapter. This delegation is not exclusive and does not restrict, impair, or supersede the authority otherwise vested by law in any District instrumentality.\n\n(A) The Corporation, by resolution of its board, may authorize the issuance of the Bonds. The resolution may stipulate the terms of the Bonds, including the following:\n\n(i) The date a Bond bears;\n\n(ii) The date a Bond matures and, if different, such other date on which a Bond may be paid;\n\n(iii) Whether Bonds are issued as serial bonds, term bonds, or as a combination of the two;\n\n(iv) The denominations;\n\n(v) The interest rate or rates, or variable rate or rates changing from time to time, as provided in, or determined pursuant to, authorization under the resolution;\n\n(vi) The method and terms of sale;\n\n(vii) The method for payment;\n\n(viii) Security for the Bonds;\n\n(ix) The terms of redemption;\n\n(x) The establishment of reserves and debt service funds and the use of proceeds of the Bonds for costs of issuance and otherwise in accordance with this subchapter; and\n\n(xi) Any other terms which, in the opinion of the board or its advisors, may be necessary or desirable for the sale of the Bonds.\n\n(B) The resolution authorizing the issuance of the Bonds shall include a statement as to:\n\n(i) Whether the Bonds are intended to be sold by competitive bid or by negotiated sale and, if the Bonds are intended to be sold by negotiated sale, a statement of the reasons that sale by competitive bid is not feasible or is not in the best interests of the Corporation;\n\n(ii) Whether the Bonds are intended to be issued on a tax-exempt or taxable basis; and\n\n(iii) Whether the Bonds are intended to be issued on a senior or subordinate basis.\n\n(C) The Corporation shall send a copy of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the Bonds to the Council within 3 days of its adoption.\n\n(3) The board may delegate to the Chief Financial Officer as a member of the board the authority to prescribe the terms and conditions of the Bonds, including those referred to in § 7-1831.03(c)(2), except that the terms and conditions of the Residual Bond shall be consistent with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement and shall provide that the Residual Interest shall be paid to the Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund established by subchapter II of this chapter, and the terms and conditions of the Remainder Certificate, if any, shall be consistent with the provisions of the Residual Bond Purchase Agreement and shall provide that the payments under the Master Settlement Agreement after payment in full of all Bonds outstanding shall be paid to the Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund established by subchapter II of this chapter.\n\n(4) A pledge by the Corporation of contract rights, general intangibles, or revenues collected by or on behalf of the Corporation as security for the Bonds shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made. The contract rights, general intangibles, or revenues pledged shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further act, and the lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding against any person having a claim of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Corporation or the District government irrespective of whether the person has notice. Notwithstanding any law, the filing or recording of a resolution, trust, agreement, financing statement, continuation statement, or other instrument adopted or entered into by the Corporation in any public record is not required to perfect the lien against third parties.\n\n(5) The Bonds shall be legal instruments in which public officers and public bodies of the District, insurance companies, insurance company associations, and other persons carrying on an insurance business, banks, bankers, banking institutions including savings and loan associations, building and loan associations, trust companies, savings banks, savings associations, investment companies, and other persons carrying on a banking business, administrators, guardians, executors, trustees, and other fiduciaries, and other persons authorized to invest in bonds or in other obligations of the District, may legally invest funds, including capital, in their control. The Bonds are also securities which legally may be deposited with and received by public officers and public bodies of the District or any agency of the District for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or other obligations of the District is authorized by law.\n\n(6) The Bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness of the District. The Bonds are not general obligations of the District and are not secured by a pledge of the full faith and credit of the District and the holders of the Bonds may not require the levy or imposition of taxes.

The Bonds issued to purchase the Fund’s right, title, and interest in the Residual Bond are obligations of the Corporation payable solely from, and secured by, the payments received under the Residual Bond. The Corporation has no taxing power. The Bonds shall contain on their face a statement containing all of the above. Nothing contained in the Bonds, or in the related financing or closing documents, shall create an obligation on the part of the Corporation or the District to make payments with respect to the Bonds from sources other than the payments received by the Corporation under the Master Settlement Agreement or under the Fund under the Residual Bond.\n\n(7) Regardless of their form or character, the Bonds are negotiable instruments for all purposes of Title 28, subject only to the provisions of the bonds and notes for registration.\n\n(8) No official, employee, or agent of the Corporation or the District shall be held personally liable solely because the Bonds are issued.\n\n(9) The District pledges, which pledge the Corporation may include in any agreement with the holders of the Bonds, to the Corporation that the District will:\n\n(i) Continue to diligently enforce the Model Statute against all tobacco product manufacturers selling tobacco products in the District that are not signatories to the Master Settlement Agreement;\n\n(ii) Enforce the District’s rights to receive the payments to be made to the District pursuant to the Master Settlement Agreement to the full extent permitted by the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement;\n\n(iii) Not amend the Master Settlement Agreement in any way that would materially impair the rights of the holders of Bonds;\n\n(iv) Not limit or alter rights vested in the Corporation to fulfill agreements made with holders of the Bonds; or\n\n(v) Not in any way impair the rights and remedies of the holders of the Bonds until the Bonds, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceedings by or on behalf of the holders of the Bonds are fully met and discharged.\n\n(10) The signature of an officer of the Corporation that appears on the Bonds, including Bonds not yet issued or delivered, shall remain valid notwithstanding that the person has ceased to hold that office.\n\n(11) The Bonds, and the interest thereon, shall be exempt from District taxation, except estate, inheritance, and gift taxes.\n\n(12) During a control period (as defined in § 47-392.09), a resolution of the board of directors of Corporation authorizing the issuance of the Bonds shall be submitted to the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority (“Authority”) for certification in accordance with § 47-392.04.
