      "text": "(a) Each employer who employs 1 or more individuals in any employment shall for each month, beginning with the month of January 1936, and ending December 31, 1939, pay contributions equal to the following percentages of the total wages payable (regardless of the time of payment) with respect to such employment by him during such month:\n\n(1) With respect to employment during the calendar year 1936, the rate shall be 1%;\n\n(2) With respect to employment during the calendar year 1937, the rate shall be 2%;\n\n(3) With respect to employment during the calendar years 1938 and 1939, the rate shall be 3%.\n\n(b) Each employer shall pay contributions equal to 2.7% of wages paid by him during the calendar year 1940 and thereafter with respect to employment after December 31, 1939. After December 31, 1978, each employer shall pay contributions at the rate in effect for the current year as provided by subsections (c)(3), (c)(4)(B), and (c)(8)(A) of this section.\n\n(1) The Director shall maintain a separate account for each employer, and shall credit his account with all of the contributions paid by him after June 30, 1939, with respect to employment subsequent to May 31, 1939. Each year the Director shall credit to each of such accounts having a positive reserve on the computation date, the interest earned from the federal government in the following manner: Each year the ratio of the credit balance in each individual account to the total of all the credit balances in all employer accounts shall be computed as of such computation date, and an amount equal to the interest credited to the District’s account in the Unemployment Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States for the 4 most recently completed calendar quarters shall be credited prior to the next computation date on the pro rata basis to all employers’ accounts having a credit balance on the computation date. Such amount shall be prorated to the individual accounts in the same ratio that the credit balance in each individual account bears to the total of the credit balances in all such accounts. In computing the amount to be credited to the account of an employer as a result of interest earned by funds on deposit in the Unemployment Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States to the account of the District, any voluntary contribution made by an employer after June 30th of any year shall not be considered a part of the account balance of the employer until the next computation date occurring after such voluntary contribution was made. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to grant any employer or individual in his service prior claims or rights to the amounts paid by him into the Fund either on his own behalf or on behalf of such individuals.\n\n(A) Benefits paid to an individual with respect to any week of unemployment which was based on an initial claim filed after June 30, 1939, and before July 1, 1940, shall be charged against the account of his most recent employer. Benefits paid to an individual on an initial claim for benefits filed after June 30, 1940, shall be charged against the accounts of his base period employers, except as specifically provided by subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) below. The amount of benefits so chargeable against each base period employer’s account shall bear the same ratio to the total benefits paid to an individual as the base period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total amount of the base period wages paid to the individual by all of his base period employers. All base period employers whose accounts could be charged with benefits paid to an individual with respect to a claim made pursuant to this subchapter shall be given notice of potential charges.\n\n(B) After December 31, 1971, benefits paid to an individual for any week during which he is attending a training or retraining course under the provision of § 51-110(d)(2) shall not be charged against such employer accounts, except that this subparagraph shall not apply to employers who have elected to make payments in lieu of contributions under subsection (f) or (h) of this section.\n\n(C) After December 31, 1971, extended benefits paid to an exhaustee under the provisions of § 51-107(g) shall not be charged against such employer accounts, except that this provision shall not apply to employers who have elected to make payments in lieu of contributions under subsection (f) or (h) of this section.\n\n(D) Commencing with the first full calendar quarter following the effective date of this subchapter, but no earlier than January 1, 1979, benefits paid to an individual subsequent to a disqualification imposed under the provisions of § 51-110(a) or (b) shall not be charged against such employer accounts, except that this provision shall not apply to employers who have elected to make payments in lieu of contributions under subsection (f) or (h) of this section.\n\n(E) Benefits paid to an individual with respect to any week of unemployment during which the individual is a continuing part-time employee of an employer other than the separating employer shall not be charged to the continuing employer’s account, except this provision shall not apply to those employers who have elected to make payments in lieu of contributions under subsection (f) or (h) of this section.\n\n(F) Commencing with overpayments of benefits established after September 30, 2013, no employer shall be relieved of benefit charges for payments made from the District Unemployment Fund if the charges resulted from benefit payments made because the employer or the employer’s agent was at fault for failing to respond timely or adequately to the request of the Director for information relating to the claim for benefits and the employer or agent has established a pattern of failing to respond timely or adequately to such requests unless the Director finds such failure was for good cause.\n\n(G) Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation benefits paid to an individual pursuant to section 2104 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, approved March 27, 2020 (Pub. L. No. 116-136; 134 Stat. 318), shall not be charged against an employer's account.\n\n(i) The following benefits paid to an individual who became unemployed or partially unemployed as a result of the circumstances giving rise to the public health emergency shall not be charged to an employer's experience rating:\n\n(I) Benefits paid to an affected employee pursuant to section 101(a), (b), (d), (e), and (g) of the Coronavirus Support Temporary Amendment Act of 2021, effective June 24, 2021 (D.C. Law 24-9; 68 DCR 4824) [Expired], or any preceding act of the Council of the District of Columbia authorizing payment of benefits on substantially similar terms as those described in section 101 [Expired];\n\n(II) Benefits paid to an affected employee after the expiration of section 101 [Expired], because the employee continues to otherwise qualify for benefits; and\n\n(III) Benefits paid under other local or federal law, including the federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program and extended benefits authorized under § 51-107(g).\n\n(ii) For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term:\n\n(I) \"Affected employee\" shall have the same meaning as provided in section 101(d) of the Coronavirus Support Temporary Amendment Act of 2021, effective June 24, 2021 (D.C. Law 24-9; 68 DCR 4824) [Expired].\n\n(II) \"Public health emergency\" means the Coronavirus (COVID-19) public health emergency declared pursuant to Mayor's Order 2020-046, on March 11, 2020, and all subsequent extensions.\n\n(A) After January 1, 1983, each employer newly subject to this subchapter shall pay contributions at a rate equal to the average rate on taxable wages of all employers for the preceding 12-month period ending June 30th (rounded to the next higher tenth of 1%) or 2.7%, whichever is higher, until he has been an employer for a sufficient period to meet the requirement to qualify for a reduced rate based on experience as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection.\n\n(B) Employers electing to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall make payments pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(A) After December 31, 1978, contribution rates of all employers whose accounts could have been charged with benefits paid throughout the 36-consecutive-calendar-month period ending on the computation date applicable to such year or part thereof shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.\n\n(i) If the balance of the Fund referred to in § 51-106 as of September 30, in any calendar year exceeds 3% of the total payrolls of employers subject to contributions under this subchapter on the preceding June 30, Table I in subsection (c)(8)(A) of this section shall be used to compute rates for employers pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.\n\n(ii) If the balance of the Fund as of September 30 in any calendar year shall be greater than 2.5% but not in excess of 3% of the total payrolls of employers subject to contributions under this subchapter on the preceding June 30, Table II in subsection (c)(8)(A) of this section shall be used to compute the rates for employers pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.\n\n(iii) If the balance of the Fund as of September 30 in any calendar year shall be greater than 2% but not in excess of 2.5% of the total payrolls of employers subject to contributions under this subchapter on the preceding June 30, Table III in subsection (c)(8)(A) of this section shall be used to compute rates for employers pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.\n\n(iv) If the balance of the Fund on September 30 of any calendar year shall be greater than 1.5% but not in excess of 2% of the total payrolls subject to contributions on the preceding June 30, Table IV in subsection (c)(8)(A) of this section shall be used to compute rates for employers pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.\n\n(v) If the balance of the Fund on September 30 of any calendar year shall be greater than .8% but not in excess of 1.5% of the total payrolls of employers subject to contributions under this subchapter on the preceding June 30, Table V in subsection (c)(8)(A) of this section shall be used to compute rates for employers pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.\n\n(vi) If the balance of the Fund on September 30 of any calendar year shall not be greater than .8% of the total payrolls of employers subject to contributions under this subchapter on the preceding June 30, Table VI in subsection (c)(8)(A) of this section shall be used to compute employer rates pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.\n\n(C) When the Director finds that the continuity of an employer’s employment experience has been interrupted solely by reason of 1 or more of the owners, officers, managers, partners, or majority stockholders of such employer’s employing enterprise having served in the armed forces of the United States of America or any of its allies during a time of war, such employer’s employment experience shall be deemed to have been continuous throughout the period that such individual or individuals so served in such armed forces, including the period up to the time it again resumes the status of an employer liable for contributions under this subchapter, provided it resumes such status within 2 years from the date of discharge of such individual or individuals or from the date of the termination of such war, whichever date is the earlier. For the purposes of this subparagraph, in determining an employer’s contribution rate his average annual payroll shall be the average of his last 3 annual payrolls.\n\n(5) The Director shall for any uncompleted portion of the calendar year beginning July 1, 1943, and for each calendar year thereafter classify employers in accordance with their actual experience in the payment of contributions and with respect to benefits charged against their accounts, except as provided in subsection (c)(3) of this section. Each employer’s contribution rate for each subsequent year or part thereof shall be calculated on the basis of his records filed with the Director and benefit payments disbursed through the applicable computation date. The Director shall compute rates for the second 6 months of 1963 for all employers first acquiring the necessary 12 months’ benefit experience under subsection (c)(4)(A) of this section on the computation date June 30, 1963. Such rates shall be based upon such employer’s experience in the payment of contributions and benefits charged against his account through June 30, 1963, prior to the crediting of his account with Trust Fund interest. All employers issued a rate for the second 6 months of 1963, under this subsection, shall have a computation date of September 30, 1963, for the calendar year 1964.\n\n(6) If, as of the date such classification of employers is made, the Director finds that an employing unit has failed to file any report in connection therewith, or has filed a report which the Director finds incorrect or insufficient, the Director shall make an estimate of the information required from such employing unit on the basis of the best evidence reasonably available to it at the time, and notify the employing unit thereof by registered mail addressed to its last-known address. Unless such employing unit shall file the report or a correct or sufficient report, as the case may be, within 15 days after the mailing of such notice, the Director shall compute such employing unit’s rate of contribution on the basis of such estimates, and the rates so determined shall be subject to increase, but not to reduction, on the basis of subsequently ascertained information.\n\n(A) After December 31, 2005, if any employer transfers all or a portion of its trade or business to another employer, the transferee shall be determined a successor for the purposes of this section.\n\n(i) If the Director is unable to get information upon which to determine what portion of the business has been transferred, the Director may, in the Director’s discretion, make such determination based upon the quarterly payrolls of the employers involved for the last complete calendar quarter prior to the transfer and the first complete calendar quarter after such transfer.\n\n(ii) In the event of a transfer of a portion of the assets of a covered employer’s business by any means whatever, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade, such transfer shall be deemed a transfer of business and shall constitute the transferee a successor hereunder, unless the director, on the Director’s own motion or on application of an interested party, finds that all of the following conditions exist:\n\n(I) The transferee has not assumed any of the transferor’s obligations;\n\n(II) The transferee has not continued or resumed transferor’s goodwill;\n\n(III) The transferee has not continued or resumed the business of the transferor, either in the same establishment or elsewhere; and\n\n(IV) The transferee has not employed substantially the same employees as those the transferor had employed in connection with the assets transferred.\n\n(B) The successor, if not already subject to this section, shall become an “employer” subject hereto on the date of such transfer, and shall accordingly become liable for contributions hereunder from and after said date.\n\n(C) The successor shall take over and continue the employer’s account, including its reserve and all other aspects of its experience under this section, in proportion to the payroll assignable to the transferred business as determined for the purposes of this section by the Director. However, his successor shall take over only the reserve actually credited to the account of the transferor or for which the transferor has filed a claim with the Director at the date of transfer. The successor shall be secondarily liable for any amounts owed by the employer to the Fund at the time of such transfer; but such liability shall be proportioned to the extent of the transfer of business and shall not exceed the value of the assets transferred.\n\n(D) The benefit chargeability of a successor’s account under subsection (c) of this section, if not accrued before the transfer date, shall begin to accrue on the transfer date in case the transferor’s benefit chargeability was then accruing; or shall begin to accrue on the date otherwise applicable to the successor, or on the date otherwise applicable to the transferor, whichever is earlier, in case the transferor’s benefit chargeability was not accruing on the transfer date. Similarly, benefits from a successor’s account, if not chargeable before the transfer date, shall become chargeable on the transfer date, in case the transferor was then chargeable for benefit payments; or shall become chargeable on the date otherwise applicable to the successor or on the date otherwise applicable to the transferor, whichever is earlier, in case the transferor was chargeable for benefit payments on the transfer date.\n\n(E) The account taken over by the successor employer shall remain chargeable with respect to accrued benefit and related rights based on employment in the transferred business, and all such employment shall be deemed employment performed for such employer.\n\n(F) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, if the successor employer was an employer subject to this subchapter prior to the date of transfer, his rate of contributions the remainder of the calendar year shall be his rate with respect to the period immediately preceding his date of acquisition. If the successor was not an employer prior to the date of transfer, his rate shall be the rate applicable to the transferor or transferors with respect to the period immediately preceding the date of transfer; provided, that there was only 1 transferor or there were only transferors with identical rates; if the transferor rates were not identical, the successor’s rate shall be the highest rate applicable to any of the transferors with respect to the period immediately preceding the date of transfer. The rate of the transferor, if still subject to the chapter, will not be redetermined and shall remain the rate with respect to the period immediately preceding the date of transfer.\n\n(G) For future years, for the purposes of subsection (c) of this section, the Director shall determine the “experience under this section” of the successor employer’s account and of the transferring employer’s account by allocating to the successor employer’s account for each period in question the respective proportions of the transferring employer’s payroll, contributions, and the benefit charges which the Director determines to be properly assignable to the business transferred.\n\n(8) Variations from the standard rates of contributions for each calendar year or part thereof shall be determined as of the applicable computation date in accordance with the following requirements:\n\n(A) As of the computation date, the total benefits paid after June 30, 1939, then chargeable or charged to any employer’s account, shall be subtracted from the total of all contributions credited to his account with respect to employment since May 31, 1939. The result of this computation shall be known as the employer’s reserve and the employer’s contribution rate for the ensuing calendar year shall be established under Table I, II, III, IV, V, or VI of this subparagraph in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection.\n\n(B) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever through inadvertence or mistake erroneous charges or credits are found to have been made to experience-rating accounts, the same shall be readjusted as of the date of discovery and such readjustment shall not affect any computation or rate assigned prior to the date of discovery but shall be used on the next computation date in calculating future contribution rates.\n\n(C) Repealed.\n\n(9) As used in this subsection:\n\n(A) The term “annual payroll” means the total amount of wages for employment paid by an employer during a 12-month period ending 90 days prior to the computation date.\n\n(B) The term “average annual payroll,” except for the purposes of paragraph (4)(C) of this subsection, means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer for the 3 consecutive 12-month periods ending 90 days prior to the computation date; provided, that for an employer whose account could have been charged with benefit payments throughout at least 12 but less than 36 consecutive calendar months ending on the computation date, the term “average annual payroll” means the total amount of wages for employment paid by him during the 12-month period ending 90 days prior to the computation date.\n\n(C) The term “base-period wages” means the wages paid to an individual during his base period for employment.\n\n(D) The term “base-period employers” means the employers by whom an individual was paid his base-period wages.\n\n(E) The term “most recent employer” means that employer who last employed such individual immediately prior to such individual’s filing an initial claim for benefits.\n\n(10) At least 1 month prior to the final date upon which the first contributions for any calendar year or part thereof become due from any employer at a contribution rate determined under this subsection, the Director shall notify such employer of his rate of contributions and of the benefit charges upon which such rate was based. Such determination shall become conclusive and binding upon the employer unless, within 30 days after the mailing of notice thereof to his last-known address, or in the absence of mailing, within 30 days after the delivery of such notice, the employer files an application for review and a redetermination, setting forth his reasons therefor. Upon receipt of such application, the Director shall voluntarily adjust such matter or shall grant an opportunity for a fair hearing and promptly notify the employer thereof. All such hearings shall be held before a Contribution Rate Review Committee composed of 3 members who shall be employees of the Director and appointed by the Director. The findings and decision of this Committee shall not be subject to review by the Office of the Inspector General. No employer shall have standing, in any proceeding involving his rate of contributions or contribution liability, to contest the chargeability of his account of any benefits paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination, or decision pursuant to § 51-111, except on the ground that the services on the basis of which such benefits were found to be chargeable do not constitute services performed in employment for him and only in the event that he was not a party to such determination, redetermination, or decision or to any other proceedings under this subchapter in which the character of such services was determined. The employer shall be promptly notified in writing of the Director’s denial of his application or of the Director’s redetermination. An employer aggrieved by the Director’s decision may seek review of such determination in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in accordance with the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n(11) After December 31, 1971, the separate account established for an employer under the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be discontinued effective the calendar quarter next succeeding 3 calendar years after the employer has been determined out of business. Thereafter no employer shall have any right to or interest in such discontinued account.\n\n(d) The contributions payable pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall become due and be paid by each employer to the Director, and shall not be deducted in whole or in part from the wages of individuals in such employer’s employ.\n\n(1) From December 31, 1939, to January 1, 1955, wages, for the purpose of this section, shall not include any amount in excess of $3,000 paid by an employer to any person arising out of his or her employment during any calendar year. From January 1, 1955, to December 31, 1971, wages shall not include any amount in excess of $3,000 actually paid by an employer to any person during any calendar year. From January 1, 1972, through December 31, 1977, inclusive, wages shall not include any amount in excess of $4,200. From January 1, 1978, through December 31, 1981, taxable wages shall not include any amount in excess of $6,000. For the purpose of determining employer contributions after January 1, 1982, the term “wages” shall not include any amount in excess of $7,500 (or in excess of the limitation on the amount of taxable wages fixed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (26 U.S.C. § 3306), whichever is greater) actually paid by an employer to any person during the calendar year. After December 31, 1954, the term “employment” for the purpose of this subsection shall include services constituting employment under any employment security law of a state or of the federal government. After December 31, 1971, the term “employment” for the purpose of this subsection shall include services constituting employment performed in the employ of a transferor as determined under the provisions of subsection (c)(7) of this section. For the purpose of determining employer contributions after January 1, 1983, the term “wages” shall not include any amount in excess of $8,000 (or in excess of the limitation on the amount of taxable wages fixed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (26 U.S.C. § 3306), whichever is greater) actually paid by an employer to any person arising out of employment during any calendar year.\n\n(2) After January 1, 1993, the term “wages” shall not include any amount in excess of $9,000 actually paid to any person arising out of employment in any succeeding calendar year.\n\n(3) After January 1, 1994, the term “wages” shall not include any amount in excess of $9,500 actually paid to any person arising out of employment in any succeeding calendar year; provided, however that should the balance in the Fund referred to in § 51-106 exceed $40 million as of September 30, 1993, then the term “wages” contained in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be applicable.\n\n(4) After January 1, 1995, the term “wages” shall not include any amount in excess of $10,000 actually paid to any person arising out of employment in any succeeding calendar year; provided, however, that should the balance in the Fund referred to in § 51-106 exceed $80 million as of September 30, 1994, then the term “wages” contained in paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be applicable; be it further provided, however, that if the term “wages” has the same meaning as in paragraph (2) of this subsection as of December 31, 1994, then the term “wages” shall not include any amount in excess of $9,500 actually paid to any person arising out of employment in any succeeding calendar year.\n\n(5) After January 1, 1996, the term “wages” shall not include any amount in excess of $10,000 actually paid to any person arising out of employment in any succeeding calendar year; provided, however, that should the balance in the Fund referred to in § 51-106 exceed $120 million as of September 30, 1995, then the term “wages” contained in paragraph (4) of this subsection shall be applicable.\n\n(6) After January 1, 1997, the term “wages” shall not include any amount in excess of $9,000 actually paid to any person arising out of employment in 1997 or in any succeeding calendar year.\n\n(A) If the District elects to cover employees under this subchapter under the provisions of § 51-101(2)(H)(i), or if any of its instrumentalities are required to be covered under this subchapter, in lieu of contributions required of employers under this subchapter, the District shall pay into the Fund an amount equivalent to the amount of benefits paid to individuals based on wages paid by the District.\n\n(B) In lieu of contributions required of employers under this subchapter, a government entity or instrumentality that would otherwise be liable for contributions pursuant to § 51-101(2)(A)(ii) may pay into the Fund an amount equivalent to the amount of benefits paid to individuals based on wages paid by the government entity or instrumentality.\n\n(C) If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by the District, or another government entity or instrumentality, and one or more other employers, the amount payable by the District or other government entity or instrumentality to the Fund shall bear the same ratio to total benefits paid to the individual as the base-period wages paid to the individual by the District or other government entity or instrumentality bears to the total amount of the base-period wages paid to the individual by all of his base-period employers.\n\n(2) The amount of payment required under this section shall be ascertained by the Director quarterly and, with respect to the District, shall be paid from the general funds of the District at such time and in such manner as the Mayor of the District may prescribe except that to the extent that benefits are paid on wages paid by the District from special administrative funds, the payment by the District into the Unemployment Fund shall be made from such special funds. The District shall be liable only for 50% of any extended benefits paid.\n\n(3) After December 31, 1977, the District or any government entity or instrumentality liable for contributions pursuant to § 51-101(2)(A)(ii) shall be provided the option of financing the costs of benefits paid to its employees by electing to pay contributions under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section or by electing to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions under the same terms and conditions provided for nonprofit organizations in subsection (h) of this section, except as provided in the following sentence. For weeks of unemployment beginning January 1, 1979, and thereafter, the District or any government entity or instrumentality liable for contributions pursuant to § 51-101(2)(A)(ii) shall be chargeable if it elects to pay contributions, or shall be liable if it elects to make payments in lieu of contributions, for the cost of regular benefits plus 100% of any extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of the District or respective governmental entity or instrumentality.\n\n(g) Contributions due under this subchapter with respect to wages for insured work shall, for the purpose of this section, be deemed to have been paid to the Fund as of the date payment was made as contributions therefor under another state or federal employment security law if payment into the Fund of such contributions is made on such terms as the Director finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests; provided, that liability to the Fund shall not exceed contributions for the 3 calendar years next preceding the quarter in which liability was determined. Payments to the Fund under this subsection shall be deemed to be contributions for purposes of this section.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, benefits paid to employees of nonprofit organizations shall be financed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For the purpose of this subsection and subsection (i) of this section, a nonprofit organization is an organization (or group of organizations) described in § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which is exempt from income tax under § 501(a) of such Code.\n\n(1) Any nonprofit organization which, pursuant to § 51-101(2)(A)(iii), is, or becomes, subject to this subchapter on or after January 1, 1972, shall pay contributions under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, unless it elects, in accordance with this paragraph to pay to the Director for the District Unemployment Fund an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization, to individuals for weeks of unemployment which begin during the effective period of such election.\n\n(A) Any nonprofit organization which is, or becomes, subject to this subchapter on January 1, 1972, may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than 1 taxable year beginning with January 1, 1972; provided, that it files with the Director a written notice of its election within the 30-day period immediately following such date or within a like period immediately following the date of enactment of this subparagraph whichever occurs later.\n\n(B) Any nonprofit organization which becomes subject to this subchapter after January 1, 1972, may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than the remainder of that and the next year beginning with the date on which such liability begins by filing a written notice of its election with the Director not later than 30 days immediately following the date of the determination of such liability.\n\n(C) Any nonprofit organization which makes an election in accordance with subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this paragraph will continue to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions until it files with the Director a written notice terminating its election not later than 30 days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which such termination shall first be effective.\n\n(D) Any nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this subchapter for a period subsequent to January 1, 1972, may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the Director not later than 30 days prior to the beginning of any taxable year a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions. Such election shall not be terminal by the organization for that and the next year.\n\n(E) The Director may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election, or a notice of termination, must be filed and may permit an election to be retroactive but not any earlier than with respect to benefits paid after December 31, 1969.\n\n(F) The Director shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination which the Director may make of its status as an employer and of the effective date of any election which it makes and of any termination of such election. Such determinations shall be subject to reconsideration, appeal and review in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(G) Any nonprofit organization which elects to make payments in lieu of contributions into the District Unemployment Compensation Fund as provided in this paragraph shall not be liable to make such payments with respect to the benefits paid to any individual whose base-period wages include wages for previously uncovered services as defined in § 51-101(3)(c) to the extent that the Unemployment Compensation Fund is reimbursed for such benefits pursuant to § 121 of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 (26 U.S.C. § 3304, note).\n\n(2) Payments in lieu of contributions shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph including either subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.\n\n(A) At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of any other period as determined by the Director, the Director shall bill each nonprofit organization (or group of such organizations) which has elected to make payments in lieu of contributions for an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid that is attributable to service in the employ of such organization.\n\n(i) Each nonprofit organization that has elected payments in lieu of contributions may request permission to make such payments as provided in this subparagraph. Such method of payment shall become effective upon approval by the Director.\n\n(ii) At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of such other period as determined by the Director, the Director shall bill each nonprofit organization for an amount representing 1 of the following:\n\n(I) For 1972, one-fourth of 1% of its total payroll for 1971;\n\n(II) For years after 1972, such percentage of its total payroll for the immediately preceding calendar year as the Director shall determine. Such determination shall be based each year on the average benefit costs attributable to service in the employ of nonprofit organizations during the preceding calendar year;\n\n(III) For any organization which did not pay wages throughout the 4 calendar quarters of the preceding calendar year, such percentage of its payroll during such year as the Director shall determine.\n\n(iii) At the end of each taxable year, the Director may modify the quarterly percentage of payroll thereafter payable by the nonprofit organization in order to minimize excess or insufficient payments.\n\n(iv) At the end of each taxable year, the Director shall determine whether the total of payments for such year made by a nonprofit organization is less than, or in excess of, the total amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid to individuals during such taxable year based on wages attributable to service in the employ of such organization. Each nonprofit organization whose total payments for such year are less than the amount so determined shall be liable for payment of the unpaid balance to the fund in accordance with subparagraph (C) of this paragraph. If the total payments exceed the amount so determined for the taxable year, all or a part of the excess may, at the discretion of the Director, be refunded from the Fund or retained in the Fund as part of the payments which may be required for the next taxable year.\n\n(C) Payment of any bill rendered under subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall be made not later than 30 days after such bill was mailed to the last-known address of the nonprofit organization or was otherwise delivered to it, unless there has been an application for review and redetermination in accordance with subparagraph (E) of this paragraph.\n\n(D) Payments made by a nonprofit organization under the provisions of this subsection shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the organization.\n\n(E) The amount due specified in any bill from the Director shall be conclusive on the organization unless, not later than 15 days after the bill was mailed to its last-known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an application for redetermination by the Director, setting forth the grounds for such application or appeal. The Director shall promptly review and reconsider the amount due specified in the bill and shall thereafter issue a redetermination in any case in which such application for redetermination has been filed. Any such redetermination shall be conclusive on the organization unless the organization files an appeal as set forth in subsection (c)(10) of this section, setting forth the grounds for the appeal.\n\n(F) Past due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same interest and penalties that, pursuant to § 51-104(c), apply to past due contributions.\n\n(3) In the discretion of the Director, any nonprofit organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required within 30 days after the effective date of its election, to execute and file with the Director a surety bond approved by the Director, or it may elect instead to deposit with the Director money. The amount of such bond or deposit shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.\n\n(A) The amount of the bond or deposit required by this paragraph shall be equal to one-fourth of 1% of the organization’s total wages paid for employment as defined in § 51-101(2)(A)(iii) for the 4 calendar quarters immediately preceding the effective date of the election, the renewal date in the case of a bond, or the biennial anniversary of the effective date of election in the case of a deposit of money, whichever date shall be most recent and applicable. If the nonprofit organization did not pay wages in each of such 4 calendar quarters, the amount of the bond or deposit shall be as determined by the Director.\n\n(B) Any bond deposited under this paragraph shall be in force for a period of not less than 2 taxable years and shall be renewed with the approval of the Director at such times as the Director may prescribe, but not less frequently than at 2-year intervals as long as the organization continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The Director shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as he deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the organization within 15 days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it. Failure by any organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments in lieu of contributions when due, together with any applicable interest and penalties provided for in § 51-104(c), shall render the surety liable on said bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was such organization.\n\n(C) Any deposit of money in accordance with this paragraph shall be retained by the Director in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereinafter provided. The Director may deduct from the money deposited under this paragraph by a nonprofit organization to the extent necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid payments in lieu of contributions and any applicable interest and penalties provided for in § 51-104(c). The Director shall require the organization within 15 days following any deduction from a money deposit under the provisions of this subparagraph to deposit sufficient additional money to make whole the organization’s deposit at the prior level. The Director may, at any time, review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as the result of such review, he determines that an adjustment is necessary, he shall require the organization to make additional deposit within 15 days of written notice of his determination or shall return to it such portion of the deposit as he no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate.\n\n(D) If any nonprofit organization fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided under this paragraph, the Director may terminate such organization’s election to make payments in lieu of contributions and such termination shall continue for not less than the 4-consecutive-calendar-quarter period beginning with the quarter in which such termination becomes effective; provided, that the Director may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit or adjustment period by not more than 15 days.\n\n(4) If any nonprofit organization is delinquent in making payments in lieu of contributions as required under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Director may terminate such organization’s election to make payments in lieu of contributions as of the beginning of the next taxable year, and such termination shall be effective for that and the next taxable year.\n\n(5) Each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the Director for the fund the amount of regular benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employer. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than 1 employer and 1 or more of such employers are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount payable to the Fund by each employer that is liable for such payments shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.\n\n(A) If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by 1 or more employers that are liable for payments in lieu of contributions and on wages paid by 1 or more employers who are liable for contributions, the amount of benefits payable by each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base-period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base-period wages paid to the individual by all of his base-period employers.\n\n(B) If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by 2 or more employers that are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount of benefits payable by each such employer shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base-period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base-period wages paid to the individual by all of his base-period employers.\n\n(6) Two or more employers that have become liable for payments in lieu of contributions, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h)(1) of this section, may file a joint application to the Director for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each such application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group’s agent for the purposes of this paragraph. Upon approval of the application, the Director shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which it receives the application and shall notify the group’s representative of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than 2 years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the Director or upon application by the group. Upon establishment of the account, each member of the group shall be liable for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in such quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group as the total wages paid for service in employment by such member in such quarter bear to the total wages paid during such quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The Director shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance, and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this paragraph, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this paragraph by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding any provisions in subsection (h) of this section, any nonprofit organization that prior to January 1, 1969, paid contributions required by subsection (c) of this section and, pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, elects within 30 days after January 1, 1972, to make payments in lieu of contributions, shall not be required to make any such payment on account of any benefits paid, on the basis of wages paid by such organization to individuals for weeks of unemployment which began on or after the effective date of such election until the total amount of such benefits equals the amount of the positive balance in the experience rating account of such organization.\n\n(j) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this subchapter, no employer’s experience rating account shall be charged and no employer shall be liable for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to extended benefit payments which are wholly reimbursed to the District of Columbia by the federal government.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any provisions of this subchapter, no employer’s experience rating account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to any individual whose base-period wages include wages for previously uncovered services as defined in § 51-101(3)(C) to the extent that the Unemployment Insurance Fund is reimbursed for such benefits pursuant to § 121 of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 (26 U.S.C. § 3304, note).\n\n(1) Commencing January 1, 1992, an interest surcharge of 0.1% shall be added to the contribution rate of each employer required to pay contributions by this subchapter, excepting those reimbursing employers subject to the requirements of subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(2) All interest surcharges collected under this subsection shall be considered separate from contributions required by subsection (c) of this section and shall be deposited in the Interest Account established by § 51-114(c) and shall not be credited to the individual accounts of employers.\n\n(3) No interest surcharge shall be required for any year following the year in which the amount of interest-bearing advances has been reduced to zero; provided, however, that an interest surcharge shall be reimposed by the Director of the Department of Employment Services (“Director”) for the calendar year following any year in which an interest-bearing advance remains outstanding on October 1 and where there are not sufficient funds in the Interest Account to pay the interest due for that year.\n\n(1) Commencing January 1, 2006, an administrative funding assessment of 0.2% of all wages as defined in subsection (e)(6) of this section shall be paid by all employers liable for contributions required by subsections (b) and (c) of this section and by all employers liable for payments in lieu of contributions required by subsection (h) of this section. The administrative funding assessment shall be paid quarterly, but shall be separate and distinct from contributions or payments in lieu of contributions.\n\n(2) All administrative funding assessment payments collected shall be deposited into the Unemployment and Workforce Development Administrative Fund established by § 51-114(d) and shall not be credited to the accounts of individual employers.\n\n(3) Repealed.\n\n(A) For calendar quarters commencing after September 30, 2007, if the administrative funding assessments required by paragraph (1) of this subsection are not paid when due, there shall be added thereto interest at the rate of 1.5% per month, or fraction thereof, from the date the assessments became due until paid. Interest shall not be charged to a court-appointed fiduciary when the assessment payments are not paid timely because of a court order.\n\n(B) If an administrative funding assessment is not paid on or before the first day of the second month following the close of the calendar quarter for which it is due, there shall be added a penalty of 10% of the amount due. The penalty shall not be less than $100; provided, that for good cause shown, the penalty may be waived by the Director of the Department of Employment Services.\n\n(n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, all assignments of contribution rates and transfers of experience in any year commencing after December 31, 2005 shall be made in accordance with the following:\n\n(1) If an employer transfers all or a portion of its trade or business to another employer and, at the time of transfer, there exists any common ownership, management, or control of the 2 employers, the unemployment experience for the trade or business shall be transferred to the employer receiving the trade or business. The contribution rates of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective on the 1st day of the next rating year. Any penalties that may be imposed on the transfer under § 51-104 shall be retroactive to the beginning of the year in which the transfer occurred.\n\n(2) If a person is not subject to this subchapter at the time it acquires the trade or business of an employer subject to this subchapter, the unemployment experience of that trade or business shall not be transferred if the Director determines that the acquisition was solely or primarily for purpose of obtaining a lower contribution rate. In such event, the person shall be assigned a new employer rate under subsection (c)(3)(A) of this section. The Director shall use objective criteria to determine whether the trade or business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower contribution rate, including:\n\n(A) The cost of acquiring the trade or business enterprise;\n\n(B) Whether the trade or business was continued by the person after acquisition;\n\n(C) The length of time that the trade or business was continued; and\n\n(D) Whether a substantial number of new employees were hired to perform duties unrelated to the trade or business activity prior to the acquisition.\n\n(3) The Director shall establish procedures to identify the transfer or acquisition of a trade or business for the purposes of this subchapter.",

      "text": "(a) The contributions required by § 51-103, or payment in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h), shall be paid to and collected by the Director, and shall, immediately upon collection, be deposited in the Clearing Account of the Fund. All moneys so required to be paid to and collected by the Director shall be subject to audit by the Office of the Inspector General.\n\n(A) Not later than the last day of the following month after the close of each calendar quarter, or at such other time as the Director may by regulations prescribe, every employer shall make a return of, and shall pay the contributions which shall have accrued with respect to wages paid during such quarter with respect to employment, with the following exceptions:\n\n(i) An employer with a household employee may make a return of and pay the contributions that have accrued with respect to the household employee on an annual basis on April 15th to the Department of Employment Services; and\n\n(ii) As provided in § 51-103(h).\n\n(B) The Director of Department of Employment Services shall prescribe such regulations as the director deems necessary to carry out the purpose of allowing household employer to convert from a quarterly system of payments and filing to annual filing.\n\n(2) Employers who employ 250 employees or more in a calendar quarter shall file wage reports by magnetic tape or other machine readable method approved by the Director. Employers subject to this provision who fail to file wage reports using magnetic tape or other approved method shall be deemed to have failed to file a timely contribution report and shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of subsection (c) of this section until such time as the report is filed using magnetic tape or other approved method.\n\n(1) If the contributions or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h) are not paid when due, there shall be added thereto interest at the rate of 1 1/2 % per month or fraction thereof from the date they become due until paid. Interest shall not run against a court-appointed fiduciary when the contributions or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h) are not paid timely because of a court order.\n\n(2) If contributions are not paid or wage reports are not filed on or before the first day of the second month following the close of the calendar quarters for which they are due or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h) are not made by that time, there shall be added a penalty of 10% of the amount due. The penalty shall not be less than $100 and for good cause the penalty may be waived by the Director of the Department of Employment Services.\n\n(d) In the event of the death, dissolution, insolvency, receivership, bankruptcy, composition, or assignment for benefit of creditors of any employer, contributions, or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h), then or thereafter due from such employer under this section shall have priority over all other claims, except taxes due the United States or the District, and wages (not exceeding $600 with respect to any individual) due for services performed within the 3 months preceding such event.\n\n(e) If any employer liable to pay the contribution, or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h), imposed by § 51-103 neglects and refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest) shall be a lien upon all of the property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person. Such lien shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the Director with the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia. The Director may cause a civil action to be filed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to enforce the aforesaid lien by sale of any property or rights to property, whether real or personal, of the delinquent employer affected by said lien. All persons having liens upon or claiming any interest in the property or rights to property sought to be sold, as aforesaid, shall be made parties to the proceedings and brought into court. The Court shall proceed to adjudicate all matters involved therein and finally determine the merits of all claims to a lien upon the property and rights to the property in question, and in all cases where a claim or interest of the Director therein is established, may decree a sale of such property and rights of property by the proper officer of the Court, and any sale made pursuant to such proceedings shall be made subject to any and all valid liens existing against said property or rights to property, at the date of filing of the notice of lien. Such action shall be heard by the Court at the earliest possible date, and shall be entitled to preference on the calendar of the Court over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review of this subchapter. In any suit to enforce a lien hereunder the owner of the property or rights of property affected by said lien may be allowed to file with the clerk of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia a written undertaking with 2 or more sureties to be approved by the Court, or with corporate surety approved by the Court, to the effect that he and they will pay the judgment that may be recovered and costs which judgment shall be rendered against all the persons so undertaking. Upon the approval of said undertaking the property or rights of property shall be released from such lien. No such undertaking shall be approved by the Court until the owner of the property or rights of property in question shall have given at least 2 days’ notice to the Director of his intention to apply to the Courts therefor. Each notice shall give the names and residences of the persons intended to be offered as sureties and the time when the motion for such approval will be made, and such sureties shall make oath if required that they are worth over and above all debts and liabilities double the amount of said lien. The Director may appear and object to such approval. When corporate surety is offered and the undertaking bears a certificate of the Clerk of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia that said corporation holds authority from the Secretary of the Treasury to do business in the District of Columbia and has a process agent therein, no notice shall be required. Such an undertaking as above mentioned may be offered before any suit is brought in order to discharge the property from such lien, in which case notice shall be given as aforesaid to the Director and the same proceedings shall be had as above directed in relation to the undertaking to be given after the commencement of the suit, except that when the surety is a corporation of the Clerk of said Superior Court of the District of Columbia that said corporation holds authority from the Secretary of the Treasury to do business in the District of Columbia, and has a process agent therein, no notice shall be required; and said undertaking shall be to the effect that the owner of said property or rights of property and his said sureties will pay any judgment that may be rendered in any suit that may thereafter be brought for the enforcement of said lien. If such undertaking be approved before any suit is brought, the surety or sureties may be made parties to such suit; if the undertaking be approved after suit is brought, the surety or sureties shall ipso facto become parties to the suit, and in either case the decree of the Court shall be against the surety or sureties as well as the owner. Subject to such regulations as the Council of the District of Columbia may prescribe, the Director shall issue a certificate of release of the lien if the Director finds that the liability for the amount of the contribution, or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h), imposed, together with all interest in respect thereof, has been satisfied or for any other reason deemed proper by the Director. Such lien shall continue to be valid for a period of 10 years from the date of filing of the notice thereof with the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia, unless the same shall have been released of record, as hereinbefore provided. The foregoing remedy of the Director shall be cumulative and no action taken by the Director shall be or be construed to be an election on the part of the Director to pursue any remedy hereunder to the exclusion of any other remedy for which provision is made in this subchapter.\n\n(f) Whenever any employing unit contracts with or has under it any contractor or subcontractor for any employment which is a part of its usual trade, occupation, profession, or business, said employing unit shall report to the Director, in accordance with applicable regulations, the name and address of each and every such contractor or subcontractor so employed. Unless such report is made the employing unit shall for all purposes of the chapter be deemed to employ each individual in the employ of each such contractor or subcontractor for each day during which such individual is engaged solely in performing such employment. Any employing unit who thus becomes liable for and pays contributions with respect to individuals in the employ of any such contractor or subcontractor, however, may recover same from such contractor or subcontractor.\n\n(g) In payment of any contribution, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it shall be increased to $.01.\n\n(h) If, after due notice, any employer defaults in any payment of contributions or interest thereon, the amount due may be collected by the Director or Director’s designated agent in the manner provided by law for the collection of taxes due the District on personal property in force at the time of such collection (including collection thereof by distraint), or by civil action in the name of the Director, and the employer adjudged in default shall pay the costs of such action. Civil actions brought under this section to collect contributions or interest or penalty thereon from an employer shall be heard by the Court at the earliest possible date and shall be entitled to preference upon the calendar of the Court over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review of this subchapter. This subsection shall not be construed to mean that the Director shall be required to use only this means of collecting delinquent contributions but the Director may use any other legal method which the Director deems advisable.\n\n(i) If, not later than 3 years after the date on which any contributions (or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h)) or interest thereon were paid, an employing unit which has paid such contributions (or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h)) or interest thereon shall make application for an adjustment thereof in connection with subsequent contribution with subsequent contribution payments (or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h)) or for a refund thereof because such adjustment cannot be made, and the Director shall determine that such contributions (or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h)) or interest on any portion thereof was erroneously collected, the Director shall allow such employing unit to make an adjustment thereof, without interest, in connection with subsequent contribution payments (or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h)) by it, or if such adjustment cannot be made the Director shall refund said amount, without interest, from the Clearing Account or Benefit Account upon checks issued by the Director or the Director’s duly authorized agent. For like cause and within the same period, adjustment or refund may be so made on the Director’s own initiative. Should benefits have been paid based upon work records filed by the employing unit, claiming an adjustment or refund, such benefit should be disregarded for purposes of figuring such adjustment or refund, and any such benefit payments already having been made at the time of the adjustment or refund, based upon records filed with this Director by such employing unit, shall to that extent be allowed and shall not be deemed to have been paid erroneously.\n\n(j) The Director in the Director’s discretion, whenever the Director may deem it administratively advisable, may charge off of the Director’s books any unpaid account due the Director or any credit due an employer who has been out of business for a period of more than 3 years. Whenever an account is charged off by the Director, there shall be placed in the records of the Director a reason for such action.\n\n(k) The Council of the District of Columbia, or the executive officer provided for under § 51-115(b), with the consent of the Council, may prescribe the extent, if any, to which any ruling, regulation, or decision relating to this subchapter shall be applied without retroactive effect.\n\n(1) The Director may compromise any civil case arising under this subchapter. Whenever a compromise is made by the Director in each such case, there shall be placed in the records of the Director the opinion of an attorney of the Director with the reasons therefor, including a statement of:\n\n(A) The amount of the contributions, or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h), due;\n\n(B) The amount of interest due on the same; and\n\n(C) The amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the compromise.\n\n(2) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a special escrow account into which the Director shall deposit all funds received in connection with an offer of compromise. Such funds shall be kept in such escrow account until final action is had upon the offer of compromise and shall not be subject to offset for any indebtedness whatsoever. In the event the compromise is approved, the funds shall be transferred to the District Unemployed Compensation Funds. In the event the compromise is disapproved, the funds shall be immediately returned to the individual who made the offer of compromise.\n\n(1) If any employer liable to pay contributions or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h) files a wage report for the purposes of determining the amount of contributions due under this subchapter but fails to pay contributions, interest, or penalties, the Director may assess the amount of contributions, interest, or penalties due on the basis of the information submitted and shall give written notice of such assessment to the employer. In the event such report is subsequently found to be incorrect additional assessments may be made, notwithstanding paragraph (4) of this subsection.\n\n(2) If an employer liable to pay contributions, or payments in lieu of contributions under § 51-103(h), fails to file, on or before the prescribed date, a wage report for purposes of determining the amount of contributions due under this subchapter or if such wage report when filed is deemed by the Director to be incorrect or insufficient, then the employer shall file a correct and sufficient report within 10 days after the Director requires same by written notice, and upon failure to do so, the Director shall assess the amount of contributions, interest, penalties due from such employer on the basis of such information as the Director may be able to obtain, and shall give written notice of such assessment to the employer.\n\n(3) If the Director believes that the collection of any contribution, payment in lieu of contribution, interest, or penalty under the provisions of this subchapter will be jeopardized by delay, the Director may, whether or not the time prescribed in this subchapter for the filing of reports or the payment of contributions has expired, immediately assess such contributions, payment in lieu of contributions, interest, or penalty and shall give written notice of such assessment to the employer.\n\n(4) Assessments made pursuant to this subsection shall be final and irrevocably fix the amount of contributions, interest, or penalties due and payable unless the employer shall file an appeal to the Director, pursuant to duly prescribed regulations, within 15 days of the mailing of such determination or the Director on the Director’s own motion reduces the amount of the assessment; provided, however, that any employer appealing an assessment shall first pay such contributions, interest and penalties. After a hearing, the appeal tribunal shall enter a decision affirming, modifying, or setting aside the assessment and shall promptly give the employer written notice of its decision.\n\n(n) The contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, and penalties thereon required by this subchapter shall become, from the time due and payable, a personal debt of the person liable to pay the same to the Director. For purposes of this subchapter, the term “person” shall include any officer of a corporation having 35 or fewer shareholders, any employee of such corporation responsible for the payment of contributions, interest, and penalties, and any member of a partnership or association responsible for the payment of contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, and penalties, and any member of a partnership or association responsible for the payment of contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, and penalties.\n\n(o) In addition to all other methods granted to the Director to effect the collection of delinquent contributions payment in lieu of contributions, interest, and penalties, the Director shall have the authority to seek the suspension or cancellation of any business, professional, alcoholic beverage, occupancy, or other license held by any employer subject to this subchapter.\n\n(1) For purposes of this subsection, the term:\n\n(A) “Knowingly” means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the prohibitions under this subsection.\n\n(B) “Person” means an individual, a trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation.\n\n(C) “Trade or business” includes the employer’s workforce.\n\n(D) “Violates or attempts to violate” includes acts evidencing an intent to evade, misrepresentation, or willful nondisclosure of material information.\n\n(2) Any person that knowingly violates or attempts to violate any provision of this subchapter related to the calculation, determination, or assignment of contribution rates, or knowingly advises another person in a way that results in a violation of any of those provisions, shall be subject to the following penalties:\n\n(A) If the person is an employer subject to this subchapter, the highest rate shall be assigned for the duration of the rate year in which the violation or attempted violation occurred and for the following 3 consecutive years; provided, that if the employer is already subject to the highest rate for the year that the violation or attempted violation occurred or if the increased rate would be less than 2% for that year, an additional 2% of taxable wages shall be imposed for that year and for the following 3 consecutive years.\n\n(B) If the person is not an employer subject to this subchapter, a fine shall be imposed in the amount of $5,000 for the 1st violation and in an amount not to exceed $25,000 for each additional violation. Fines shall be enforced by civil action brought by the Director and shall be deposited in the Special Administrative Expense Fund established by § 51-114(b).\n\n(3) Any violation of this subsection may also be prosecuted on information brought by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia in the Superior Court. Any person that is convicted shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $5,000, imprisoned not more than 180 days, or both, and shall be liable for costs of prosecution.\n\n(4) This subsection shall be interpreted and applied in such a manner as to meet the minimum requirements contained in any guidance or regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor.",

      "heading": "Determination of amount and duration of benefits.",
      "text": "(a) On and after January 1, 1938, benefits shall become payable from the Benefit Account of the District Unemployment Fund.\n\n(1) Subject to the limitations set forth in this section, an individual's weekly benefit amount shall be equal to one twenty-sixth (computed to the next higher multiple of $1) of the individual's total wages for insured work paid during the quarter of the individual's base period in which such total wages were highest.\n\n(2) Effective October 1, 2016, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be $425.\n\n(A) Effective January 1, 2018, and for each calendar year thereafter, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be determined by the Director of the Department of Employment Services, subject to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, by using the Department of Labor State Benefit Financing Model.\n\n(B) The Director shall consider increasing the maximum weekly benefit amount in proportion to any increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers in the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area, published by the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, in making a determination, but may increase the maximum weekly benefit amount by a lesser amount, or may not increase it, when necessary to preserve an adequate balance in the District Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund through the Financial Plan.\n\n(i) By September 30, 2017, and by September 30 of each subsequent year, the Director shall recommend to the Mayor the maximum weekly benefit amount, which shall become the maximum weekly benefit amount for the next calendar year, unless the Council passes a resolution disapproving the Director's recommendation pursuant to sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph.\n\n(ii) The Mayor shall promptly submit the recommendation, with a proposed resolution, to the Council for a 45-day period of review. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the recommendation, by resolution, within the 45-day period of review, the recommendation shall be deemed approved.\n\n(iii) If the Council passes a resolution of disapproval, the maximum weekly benefit amount then in effect shall continue in effect for the next calendar year.\n\n(1) To qualify for benefits an individual must have:\n\n(A) Been paid wages for employment of not less than $1300 in 1 quarter in his base period;\n\n(B) Been paid wages for employment of not less than $1950 in not less than 2 quarters in such period; and\n\n(C) Received during such period wages the total amount of which is equal to at least one and one-half times the amount of his wages actually received in the quarter in such period in which his wages were the highest.\n\n(2) If a claimant satisfies the above except that he received wages over the amount necessary to become eligible for maximum benefits, in the quarter in which his wages were the highest, then the additional wages received in such quarter shall not be considered in determining eligibility. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection, any otherwise qualified individual, the total amount of whose wages during such period is less than the amount required to have been received during such period under such paragraph, may qualify for benefits, if the difference between the amounts so required to have been received and the total amount of his wages during such period does not exceed $70, but the amount of his weekly benefit, as computed under subsection (b) of this section, shall be reduced by $1 if such difference does not exceed $35, or by $2 if such difference is more than $35. Wages received by an individual in the period intervening between the end of his last base period and the beginning of his last benefit year shall not be available for benefit purposes in a subsequent benefit year unless he has, subsequent to the commencement of such last benefit year, performed services for which he received wages for employment as defined in this subchapter, in an amount equal to at least 10 times the weekly benefit amount for which he qualifies in such last benefit year. Benefits payable to an individual with respect to a week shall be reduced by any amount received or applied for with respect to such week as a retirement pension or annuity under a public or private retirement plan or system provided, or contributed to, by any base period employer; except that no reduction shall be made under this sentence for any amount received under title II of the Social Security Act. For benefit years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, benefits payable to an individual who applied for or is receiving a retirement pension or annuity under a public or private retirement plan or system provided or contributed to by any base period employer shall, under duly prescribed regulations, be reduced (but not below zero) by the prorated weekly amount of such retirement pension or annuity which is reasonably attributable to such week, provided that the claimant has not made contributions to the pension or annuity. An amount received with respect to a period other than a week shall be prorated by weeks. When an individual’s weekly benefit amount is reduced by a pension, the individual’s maximum weekly benefit amount shall be deducted from his total amount of benefits determined pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Benefits payable to an individual with respect to a week shall be reduced by the amount of wages received in lieu of notice of dismissal, defined as dismissal payments that the employer is not legally required to make.\n\n(d) Any otherwise eligible individual shall be entitled during any benefit year to a total amount of benefits equal to 26 times his weekly benefit amount ; provided, that the maximum duration of benefits determined on any initial claim made prior to March 15, 1983, shall continue to be 34 weeks during the benefit year to which the initial claim relates. Such total amount of benefits, if not a multiple of $1, shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1.\n\n(e) Any individual who is unemployed in any week as defined in § 51-101(5) and who meets the conditions of eligibility for benefits of § 51-109 and is not disqualified under the provisions of § 51-110 shall be paid with respect to such week an amount equal to the individual’s weekly benefit amount less any earnings payable to the individual with respect to such week deductible in accordance with the following formula: $50 will be added to the weekly benefit amount; from the resulting sum will be subtracted 66% of any earnings payable to the individual for such week. The resulting benefits, if not a multiple of $1, shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1. In no event shall the amount paid for any week exceed the individual’s established weekly benefit amount.\n\n(f) In addition to the benefits payable under the foregoing subsections of this section, each eligible individual who is unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to such week $5 for each dependent relative, but not more than $20 shall be paid to an individual as dependent’s allowance with respect to any 1 week of unemployment nor shall any weekly benefit which includes a dependent’s allowance be paid in the amount of more than the established maximum benefit amount. An individual’s number of dependents shall be determined as of the day with respect to which he first files a valid claim for benefits in any benefit year, and shall be fixed for the duration of such benefit year. The dependent’s allowance is not to be taken into consideration in calculating the claimant’s total amount of benefits in subsection (d) of this section; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply to claims for benefit years commencing on or after January 5, 1997.\n\n(f-1) For claims for benefit years commencing after August 9, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, in addition to benefits payable under subsections (a) through (e) of this section, each eligible individual who is unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to that week $15 for each dependent relative, but no more than $50 or 1/2 of the individual’s weekly benefit amount, whichever is less, with respect to any 1 week of unemployment. The amount of the dependent’s allowance paid to an individual shall not be charged to the individual account of an employer. The number of dependents of an individual shall be determined as of the day with respect to which the individual first files a valid claim for benefits in any benefit year and shall remain fixed for the duration of the benefit year. The dependent’s allowance shall not be taken into consideration in the total amount of benefits calculated pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, this subsection provides a program of extended benefits on and after January 1, 1972.\n\n(1) As used in this subsection, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:\n\n(A) “Extended benefit period” means a period which:\n\n(i) Begins with the third week after a week in which a state “on” indicator occurs; and\n\n(ii) Ends with either of the following weeks, whichever occurs later:\n\n(I) The third week after the first week for which there is a state “off ” indicator; or\n\n(II) The 13th consecutive week of such period; provided, that no extended benefit period may begin by reason of a state “on” indicator before the 14th week following the end of a prior extended benefit period which was in effect with respect to the District.\n\n(B) For weeks commencing after September 25, 1982, there is a state “on” indicator for the District for a week if the rate of insured unemployment under this subchapter for the period consisting of such week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks:\n\n(i) Equaled or exceeded 120% of the average of such rates for the corresponding 13-week period ending in each of the preceding 2 calendar years; and\n\n(ii) Equaled or exceeded 5%; provided, that with respect to benefits for weeks of unemployment beginning on September 26, 1982, the determination of whether there is a state “on” or “off ” indicator beginning or ending any extended benefit period shall be made under this subsection as if:\n\n(I) This subparagraph did not contain sub-subparagraph (i) thereof; and\n\n(II) The figure “5” contained in sub-subparagraph (ii) thereof was “6”: except, that notwithstanding any such provision of this subsection any week for which there would otherwise be a state “on” indicator shall continue to be such a week and shall not be determined to be a week for which there is a state “off ” indicator.\n\n(C) There is a state “off ” indicator for the District for a week if, for the period consisting of that week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks, either sub-subparagraph (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph was not satisfied.\n\n(D) “Rate of insured unemployment”, for purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, means the percentage derived by dividing: (i) the average weekly number of individuals filing claims for regular benefits in the District for weeks of unemployment with respect to the most recent 13-consecutive-week period as determined on the basis of reports to the Secretary of Labor, by (ii) the average monthly employment covered under this subchapter for the first 4 of the most recent 6 completed calendar quarters ending before the end of such 13-week period.\n\n(E) “Regular benefits” means benefits payable to an individual under this subchapter or under any state law (including benefits payable to federal civilian employees and to ex-servicemen pursuant to Chapter 85 of Title 5, United States Code) other than extended benefits.\n\n(F) “Extended benefits” means benefits (including benefits payable to federal civilian employees and to ex-servicemen pursuant to Chapter 85 of Title 5, United States Code) payable to an individual under the provisions of this subsection for weeks of unemployment in his eligibility period.\n\n(G) “Eligibility period” of an individual means the period consisting of the weeks in his benefit year which begin in an extended benefit period and, if his benefit year ends within the extended period, any weeks thereafter which begin in a period.\n\n(H) “Exhaustee” means an individual who, with respect to any week of unemployment in his eligibility period:\n\n(i) Has received, prior to such a week, all of the regular benefits that were available to him under this subchapter or any state law (including dependents’ allowances and benefits payable to federal civilian employees and ex-servicemen under Chapter 85 of Title 5, United States Code) in his current benefit year that includes such a week; provided, that for the purposes of this subparagraph, an individual shall be deemed to have received all of the regular benefits that were available to him although as a result of a pending appeal with respect to wages that were not considered in the original monetary determination in his benefits year, he may subsequently be determined to be entitled to added regular benefits;

In addition, such individual’s total benefit amount shall be reduced by a sum equal to 8 times the individual’s weekly benefit amount.\n\n(3) Repealed.\n\n(1) For weeks commencing after March 15, 1983, if any individual without good cause (as determined under duly prescribed regulations) fails to apply for new work in covered employment found to be suitable when notified by any employment office or fails to accept any suitable work in covered employment when offered by any employment office, by a union hiring hall, or directly by any employer, that individual shall not be eligible for benefits until he has been employed in each of 10 subsequent weeks (whether or not consecutive) and, notwithstanding § 51-101, has earned remuneration from employment equal to not less than 10 times the weekly benefit amount to which he would be entitled pursuant to § 51-107(b).\n\n(2) In determining whether or not work is suitable, the following shall be considered:\n\n(A) The physical fitness and prior training, experience, and earnings of the individual;\n\n(B) The distance of the place of work from the individual’s place of residence; and\n\n(C) The risk involved as to health, safety, or morals.\n\n(3) The term “in covered employment” as used in this section means employment which is insured under this subchapter or any other state or federal unemployment insurance program.\n\n(1) Benefits shall not be denied to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions:\n\n(A) If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;\n\n(B) If the wages, earnings, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality; or\n\n(C) If as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization;\n\n(2) Compensation shall not be denied to any otherwise eligible individual for any week during which he is attending a training or retraining course with the approval of the Director, and such individual shall be deemed to be otherwise eligible for any such week despite the provisions of § 51-109(4) and subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, compensation shall not be denied or reduced to an individual solely because he files a claim in another state (or a contiguous country with which the United States has an agreement with respect to unemployment compensation) or because he resides in another state (or such a contiguous country) at the time he files a claim for unemployment compensation.\n\n(4) Compensation shall not be denied to any otherwise eligible individual who leaves his or her most recent work to accompany his or her spouse or domestic partner to a place from which it is impractical to commute to the place of employment. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “domestic partner” shall have the same meaning as provided in § 32-701(3).\n\n(5) Compensation shall not be denied to any otherwise eligible individual who leaves his or her most recent work to care for an ill or disabled family member.

There shall be no presumption that a person who is pregnant is physically unable to work, even when pregnancy was an issue with respect to the reason for separation from employment.\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no otherwise eligible individual shall be denied benefits for any week because:\n\n(A) He or she is in training approved under § 236(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974;\n\n(B) He or she is in such approved training by reason of leaving work to enter such training; provided, that the work left is not suitable employment; or\n\n(C) Because of the application to any such week in training of provisions in this law (or any federal unemployment insurance law administered hereunder) relating to availability for work, active search for work or refusal to accept work.\n\n(D) He or she is enrolled in an approved certificate course authorized by subchapter III of Chapter 16 of Title 32 [§ 32-1651 et seq.], and maintaining a satisfactory level of attendance and achievement, as required by subchapter III of Chapter 16 of Title 32 [§ 32-1651 et seq.].\n\n(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term “suitable employment” means, with respect to an individual, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the individual’s past adversely affected employment (as defined for purposes of the Trade Act of 1974), and wages as determined for purposes of the Trade Act of 1974.\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, an individual who is unemployed within the meaning of this subchapter, has exhausted all regular unemployment benefits provided under this subchapter, including any extensions of benefits, and who is enrolled in and making satisfactory progress in a District-approved training program or in a job training program authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, approved August 7, 1998 (112 Stat. 936; 29 U.S.C. § 2822), shall be eligible for training extension benefits if the Director determines that the following criteria are met:\n\n(A) The training program will prepare the claimant for entry into a high-demand occupation;\n\n(B) The claimant was separated from employment in a declining occupation or has been involuntarily and indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent reduction of operations at the claimant’s place of prior employment;\n\n(C) The claimant is making satisfactory progress towards completion of the training as determined by the Director, including the submission of written statements from the training program provider; and\n\n(D) The claimant is not receiving similar stipends or other training allowances for non-training costs.\n\n(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term:\n\n(A) “Declining occupation” shall be defined by the Director based upon currently available labor market information.\n\n(B) “High-demand occupation” shall be defined by the Director based upon currently available labor market information.\n\n(C) “Similar stipends” means an amount provided under a program with similar goals, such as providing training to increase employability, and in similar amounts. Similar stipends of non-training cost allowances shall be treated as “earnings” as defined in § 51-101(4).\n\n(3) A claimant who is eligible for a training extension pursuant to this subsection shall be enrolled in training and making satisfactory progress as the Director may determine will increase the employability of the claimant in the District labor market.\n\n(4) The weekly training extension benefit amount payable to the eligible individual shall be equal to the claimant’s weekly benefit amount for the most recent benefit year less any deductible or income as determined pursuant to this subchapter. The total amount of training extension benefits payable to a claimant shall not exceed 26 times the claimant’s weekly benefit amount of the most recent benefit year.\n\n(5) If the claimant completes the training program, ceases to be making satisfactory progress, or stops attending the training program, the claimant shall not be eligible for further training extension benefits unless the Director determines that the claimant has resolved the impediment.\n\n(6) A claimant seeking training extension benefits may apply for the benefits at any time prior to the end of the claimant’s initial benefit year or the end of any period of extended benefits.\n\n(7) No training extension benefits paid pursuant to this subchapter shall be charged to individual employer accounts.",

Each employer shall post and maintain in places readily accessible to individuals in his service printed statements concerning such regulations or such other matters as the Director may by regulations prescribe. Each employer shall supply such individuals with copies of such printed statements or materials relating to claims for benefits as the Director may by regulation prescribe. Such printed statements or materials shall be supplied by the Director to each employer without cost to him.\n\n(b) Promptly after an individual has filed a claim for benefits, an agent of the Director designated by it for such purpose shall make an initial determination with respect thereto which shall include a determination with respect to whether or not such benefit may be payable, and if payable, the week with respect to which payments will commence, the maximum duration thereof, and the weekly benefit amount, except that in any case in which the payment or denial of benefits will be determined by the provisions of § 51-110(e), the agent shall promptly transmit such claim to an appeal tribunal which shall make a decision thereon after such investigation as it deems necessary, and after affording the parties opportunity for fair hearing in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, and the claimant and interested parties shall be given notice thereof and permitted to appeal therefrom to the Director and the courts as is provided in this subchapter for notice of, and appeals from, decisions of appeal tribunals. An initial determination may, for good cause, be reconsidered. The claimant and other parties to the proceedings shall be promptly notified of the initial determination or any amended determination and the reasons therefor. Benefits shall be denied or, if the claimant is otherwise eligible, paid promptly in accordance with such initial determination except as hereinafter otherwise provided. The Director shall promptly notify the claimant and any party to the proceeding of its determination, and such determination shall be final within 15 calendar days after the mailing of notice thereof to the party’s last-known address or in the absence of such mailing, within 15 calendar days of actual delivery of such notice. The 15-day appeal period may be extended if the claimant or any party to the proceeding shows excusable neglect or good cause. The exception for good cause or excusable neglect shall apply to all claims pending on July 23, 2010, including those in which an appeal has been filed in the Office of Administrative Hearings or in which a petition for review has been filed in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. If an appeal tribunal affirms an initial determination allowing benefits, such benefits shall be paid regardless of any appeal which may thereafter be taken. If, subsequent to such initial determination, benefits with respect to any week for which a claim has been filed are denied for reasons other than matters included in the initial determination, the claimant shall be promptly notified of the denial and the reasons therefor, and may appeal therefrom in accordance with the procedure herein described for appeals from initial determinations.\n\n(c) To hear and decide appealed claims, the Director shall appoint 1 or more appeal tribunals to hold hearings in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Director at which all parties shall be given opportunity to present evidence and to be heard. In the conduct of such hearings, the parties shall not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence or other technical rules of procedure, but the appeal tribunal shall use due diligence to ascertain the true facts of the case.\n\n(d) Each appeal tribunal shall consist of either an examiner regularly employed by the Director on a salaried basis or a body composed of an examiner who shall act as chairman, and, without regard to the civil service laws otherwise applicable, of 1 representative of employees and 1 representative of employers, each designated by the Director. No representative shall be regularly employed by the Director, nor shall any person acting in any case on behalf of the Director have any interest, direct or indirect, in the case. In no case shall the hearings proceed unless the examiner designated as a member of an appeal tribunal is present; and if either or both of such representatives fail to appear for any such hearings or are disqualified from participating in any such hearings, the examiner shall proceed to hear the case; provided, that the Director may designate alternates to serve in the absence or disqualification of any member of an appeal tribunal. Each such representative shall be paid for each day on which he actively engaged or was present and prepared to engage in the conduct of any such hearings, such sums, not in excess of $10, as the Director shall by regulation prescribe.\n\n(e) An appeal tribunal, after affording the parties reasonable opportunity for fair hearing, shall, unless such appeal is withdrawn, affirm or modify the finding of facts and the initial determination. The parties shall be duly notified of the decision of such appeal tribunal, together with the reasons therefor. The Director, under regulations prescribed by the Director, may permit further appeal by any party or may, upon the Director’s own motion, affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the appeal tribunal or may set it aside and order a rehearing or the taking of additional evidence before the same or a different appeal tribunal. Unless a petition for such appeal is filed within 10 days of mailing of the decision of an appeal tribunal, or within such 10-day period the Director has taken action on the Director’s own motion in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the decision of the appeal tribunal shall constitute the decision of the Director and shall be effective as such. Any decision of an appeal tribunal which is not so modified or so appealed within such 10-day period is final for all purposes, except as provided in § 51-112, and is not subject to review by the Office of the Inspector General. All decisions rendered by the Director affirming, reversing, or modifying any decision of an appeal tribunal shall become effective immediately, unless the Director shall otherwise order, and are not subject to review by the Office of the Inspector General.\n\n(f) A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in connection with an appealed claim. All testimony at every hearing on any such claim shall be taken down by a stenographer or recording device, but shall not be transcribed except upon order of the Director or in the event of an appeal pursuant to § 51-112. Upon any such appeal, a copy of all the testimony and of the findings of fact upon which the Director’s decision was based shall be filed with the court, and the facts so found shall, if supported by evidence, be binding on the court.\n\n(g) Witnesses subpoenaed pursuant to this section shall be allowed fees at a rate fixed by the Director. Such fees shall be deemed part of the expense of administering this subchapter.\n\n(h) The Director shall establish and administer a Claimant-Employer Advocacy Fund, funded with monies collected as interest and penalty payments from employers due to their late filing of wage reports, late payment of employer contributions, and late payment of payments in lieu of contributions. The Fund shall be used exclusively to support the provision of assistance to and legal representation for claimants and employers involved in administrative appeals of claim determinations made by the Director. The Fund shall support the provision of such assistance and representation for claimants at the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO and shall support the provision of such assistance and representation for employers at the D.C. Chamber of Commerce and at the Greater Washington Board of Trade. The total amount of funds which the Director provides from this Fund to the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO, shall be twice the combined amount provided to the D.C. Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Washington Board of Trade.\n\n(i) Testimony in hearings arising under this subchapter may be given and received by telephone.\n\n(j) Any finding of fact or law, determination, judgment, conclusion, or final order made by a claims examiner, hearing officer, appeals examiner, the Director, or any other person having the power to make findings of fact or law in connection with any action or proceeding under this subchapter, shall not be conclusive or binding in any separate or subsequent action or proceeding between an individual and his present or prior employer brought before an arbitrator, court, or judge of the District of Columbia or the United States, regardless of whether the prior action was between the same or related parties or involved the same facts.\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, all correspondence, notices, determinations, or decisions required for the administration of this subchapter may be transmitted to claimants, employers, or necessary parties by electronic mail or other means of communication as the claimant, employer, or necessary party may select from the alternative methods of communication approved by the Director. The Director shall issue a list of such approved methods of communication within 45 days of September 20, 2012.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, all correspondence, notices, determinations, or decisions issued by the Director may be signed by an electronic signature that complies with the requirements of § 28-4917 and Mayor’s Order 2009-118, issued June 25, 2009.",

      "text": "(a) All moneys received by the Director from the United States under title III of the Social Security Act or from other sources for administering this subchapter shall, immediately upon such receipt, be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as a special deposit to be used solely to pay such administrative expenses (including expenditures for rent, for suitable office space in the District of Columbia, and for lawbooks, books of reference, and periodicals), traveling expenses when authorized by the Director, premiums on the bonds of the Director’s employees, and allowances to investigators for furnishing privately-owned motor vehicles in the performance of official duties at rates not to exceed $65 per month. All such payments of expenses shall be made by checks drawn by the Director and shall be subject to audit by the Mayor of the District of Columbia in the same manner as are payments of other expenses of the District. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and the provisions of §§ 51-102 and 51-108, the Director is authorized to requisition and receive from the Director’s account in the Unemployment Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States of America, in the manner permitted by federal law, such moneys standing to the District’s credit in such Fund, as are permitted by federal law to be used for expenses incurred by the Director for the administration of this subchapter and to expend such moneys for such purposes. Moneys so received shall, immediately upon such receipt, be deposited in the Treasury of the United States in the same special account as are all other moneys received for the administration of this subchapter. All moneys received by the Director pursuant to § 302 of the Social Security Act shall be expended solely for the purposes and in the amounts found necessary by the Department of Labor for the proper and efficient administration of this subchapter. In lieu of incorporation in this subchapter of the provision described in § 303(a)(9) of the Social Security Act, the Mayor shall include in the Mayor’s annual report to Council of the District of Columbia, provided in § 51-113, a report of any moneys received after July 1, 1941, from the Department of Labor under title III of the Social Security Act, and any unencumbered balances in the Employment Compensation Administration Fund as of that date, which the Department of Labor finds have, because of any action or contingency, been lost or have been expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those found necessary by the Department of Labor for the proper administration of this subchapter.\n\n(1) There is hereby created a special fund in the General Fund of the District of Columbia, separate and apart from the District Unemployment Fund, to be known as the Special Administrative Expense Fund. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this subchapter:\n\n(A) Interest and penalties collected from employers, and dishonored check penalties authorized by § 1-333.11 shall after January 31, 1972, be deposited into the Clearing Account in the District Unemployment Fund in the Treasury of the United States for clearance only and shall not, except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, be deemed a part of the District Unemployment Fund;\n\n(B) Thereafter, during each calendar quarter, there shall be transferred from the Clearing Account to such Special Administrative Expense Fund all moneys described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph collected during the preceding quarter; and\n\n(C) Refunds of such moneys paid into the Special Administrative Expense Fund shall be made from such Fund.\n\n(A) Said moneys shall not be expended or available for expenditure in any manner which would permit their substitution for, or a corresponding reduction in, federal funds which would in the absence of said moneys, be available to finance expenditures for the administration of this subchapter. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent said moneys from being used as a revolving fund to cover expenditures, necessary and proper under the law, for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received, subject to the charging of such expenditures against such funds when received. The moneys in this Fund shall be used by the Director for the payment of costs of administration which are found by the Director not to be proper and valid charges payable out of federal grants or other funds received for the administration of this subchapter. All such payments of expenses shall be made by checks drawn by the Director and shall be subject to audit by the District in the same manner as are payments of other expenses of the District.\n\n(B) The monies in this Fund shall also be used for the payment of the monetary benefit described in § 51-109.01(b).\n\n(3) No expenditure of this Fund shall be made unless and until the Director by written statement of authorization finds that no other funds are available or can properly be used to finance such expenditures. Vouchers drawn to pay expenditures of this Fund shall, among other things, include a copy of the written authorization of the Director hereinbefore referred to.\n\n(4) The moneys in this Fund shall be continuously available to the Director for expenditures and refunds in accordance with the provisions of this subsection and shall not lapse at any time or be transferred to any other fund or account except as are herein provided. If, on October 31st of any calendar year, the balance in this Fund exceeds $1,000,000 by $1,000 or more, the Director shall transfer such excess to the Unemployment Trust Fund. The interest on the funds in the Fund shall be credited to the Fund.\n\n(1) There is created a special fund in the General Revenue Fund of the District of Columbia Treasury, which shall be separate from the District Unemployment Fund, to be known as the Interest Account. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this subchapter:\n\n(A) All interest surcharges collected from employers shall be deposited in the Interest Account; and\n\n(B) All moneys in the Interest Account shall be used for the payment of interest assessed on interest-bearing advances received under title XII of the Social Security Act.\n\n(2) Of the amount deposited in the Interest Account, $4,500,000 shall be transferred to the Special Administrative Expense Fund established by subsection (b) of this section, upon certification of the Director to the Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia that such monies are no longer needed to pay such interest bearing advances and interest assessments. The funds transferred from the Interest Account to the Special Administrative Account shall not be subject to the limitations imposed by subsection (b)(4) of this section and shall be expended on:\n\n(A) Installation of an Interactive Voice Response system, for processing initial, reopened, and transitional claims, for responding to inquiries on current benefit overpayment balances and status of most recent repayments, for providing general information on the process for filing an appeal and specific information on the status of a filed appeal, and for the processing of a household employer’s annual contribution report;\n\n(B) Implementation of Internet based electronic applications, which would allow an employer to register, to update its account for changes of address, phone, and business status, to submit its quarterly reports, and in the case of a household employer to submit annual reports and make payment electronically;\n\n(C) Implementation of an integrated scanning, imaging, and retrieval system;\n\n(D) Implementation of an Internet based fraud control program;\n\n(E) Implementation of an Internet based system for scheduling benefit hearings and other procedures;\n\n(F) Implementation of a system for direct deposit and electronic transfer of benefit payments; and\n\n(G) Activities in support of the Unemployment Compensation Terrorist Response Temporary Amendment Act of 2002, effective July 23, 2002 (D.C. Law 14-171; 49 DCR 5072), and the increased workload associated with the events of September 11, 2001.\n\n(1) There is created a special fund in the General Revenue Fund of the District of Columbia government that shall be separate and distinct from the District Unemployment Fund, to be known as the Unemployment and Workforce Development Administrative Fund.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this subchapter:\n\n(A) All administrative assessment payments collected from employers shall be deposited into the Unemployment and Workforce Development Administrative Fund. The interest on the funds in the Unemployment and Workforce Development Administrative Fund shall be credited to the Unemployment and Workforce Development Administrative Fund.\n\n(B) All funds deposited into the Unemployment and Workforce Development Administrative Fund shall be used exclusively for the improvement of benefit claim eligibility determinations, the provision of employment and reemployment services, fraud prevention, and the costs of collecting and administering the administrative funding assessment.\n\n(C) The services and improvements shall include:\n\n(i) Increasing the number of referrals to intensive reemployment services;\n\n(ii) Providing job coaches, job clubs, and weekly reemployment workshops;\n\n(iii) Increasing the number of eligibility review interviews;\n\n(iv) Increasing the number of fraud investigations;\n\n(v) Increasing the number of staff to perform these expanded services; and\n\n(vi) Other activities that may increase the likelihood of employment or reemployment, including the activities of the Workforce Investment Council established by § 32-1603.\n\n(D) The following amounts in the Unemployment and Workforce Development Administrative Fund, or other sources of workforce development funding, may be used by the Workforce Investment Council, for the purposes set forth in § 32-1605.01:\n\n(i) In Fiscal Year 2016, $500,000; and\n\n(ii) In Fiscal Year 2017 and each fiscal year thereafter, $1.5 million.",

The application and shared work plan shall require the employer to:\n\n(1) Identify the affected unit (or units) to be covered by the shared work plan, including:\n\n(A) The number of full-time or part-time employees in such unit;\n\n(B) The percentage of employees in the affected unit covered by the plan;\n\n(C) Identification of each individual employee in the affected unit by name and social security number;\n\n(D) The employer's unemployment tax account number[;] and\n\n(E) Any other information required by the Director to identify participating employees;\n\n(2) Provide a description of how employees in the affected unit will be notified of the employer's participation in the shared work unemployment compensation program if such application is approved, including how the employer will notify those employees in a collective bargaining unit as well as any employees in the affected unit who are not in a collective bargaining unit. If the employer will not provide advance notice of the shared work plan to employees in the affected unit, the employer shall explain in a statement in the application why it is not feasible to provide such notice;\n\n(3) Identify the usual weekly hours of work for employees in the affected unit and the specific percentage by which hours will be reduced during all weeks covered by the plan. A shared work plan may not reduce participating employees' usual weekly hours of work by less than 10% or more than 60%. If the plan includes any week for which the employer regularly provides no work (due to a holiday or other plant closing), then such week shall be identified in the application;\n\n(4) If the employer provides health and retirement benefits to any participating employee whose usual weekly hours of work are reduced under the plan, certify that such benefits will continue to be provided to participating employees under the same terms and conditions as though the usual weekly hours of work of such participating employee had not been reduced or to the same extent as employees not participating in the shared work plan. For defined benefit retirement plans, the hours that are reduced under the shared work plan shall be credited for purposes of participation, vesting, and accrual of benefits as though the participating employee's usual weekly hours of work had not been reduced. The dollar amount of employer contributions to a defined contribution plan that are based on a percentage of compensation may be reduced due to the reduction in the participating employee's compensation. A reduction in health and retirement benefits scheduled to occur during the duration of a shared work plan that is equally applicable to employees who are not participating in the plan and to participating employees does not violate a certification made pursuant to this paragraph;\n\n(5) Certify that the aggregate reduction in work hours under the shared work plan is in lieu of temporary or permanent layoffs, or both, and provide a good-faith estimate of the number of employees who would be laid off in the absence of the proposed shared work plan;\n\n(6) Agree to:\n\n(A) Furnish reports to the Director relating to the proper conduct of the shared work plan;\n\n(B) Allow the Director or the Director's authorized representatives access to all records necessary to approve or disapprove the application for a shared work plan;\n\n(C) Allow the Director to monitor and evaluate the shared work plan; and\n\n(D) Follow any other directives the Director considers necessary for the agency to implement the shared work plan consistent with the requirements for shared work plan applications;\n\n(7) Certify that participation in the shared work unemployment compensation program and implementation of the shared work plan will be consistent with the employer's obligations under applicable federal and District laws;\n\n(8) State the duration of the proposed shared work plan, which shall not exceed 365 days from the effective date established pursuant to section 6;\n\n(9) Provide any additional information or certifications that the Director determines to be appropriate for purposes of the shared work unemployment compensation program, consistent with requirements issued by the United States Secretary of Labor; and\n\n(10) Provide written approval of the proposed shared work plan by the collective bargaining representative for any employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement who will participate in the plan.",
