Proof of freedom from vicious habits, intemperance, or willful misconduct for a period of more than 5 years next prior to having a disability for useful and efficient service shall not be required in any case. No claim shall be allowed under the provisions of this section unless the application for retirement shall have been executed prior to the applicant’s separation from the service or within 6 months thereafter. No teacher shall be retired under the provisions of this section unless examined under the direction of the Director of the Department of Human Services of the District of Columbia, and as a result of said examination, in his judgment, or in the judgment of the Superintendent of Schools concurred in by two thirds of the members of the Board of Education, shall have been found to be physically or mentally incapacitated for efficient service.\n\n(b) Every annuitant retired under the provisions of this section, unless the disability for which retired be permanent in character, shall at the expiration of one year from the date of such retirement and annually thereafter, until reaching retirement age as defined in § 38-2021.03, be examined under the direction of the Director of the Department of Human Services of the District of Columbia in order to ascertain the nature and degree of the annuitant’s disability, if any.

Payment of the annuity shall be continued until the date of reappointment by the Board of Education. In the event that the annuitant refuses to accept the employment prescribed in this section no annuity shall be paid after the date of such refusal. Should the annuitant fail to appear for examination as required under this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability shall have been satisfactorily established. Upon written recommendation of the Superintendent of Schools, the Board of Education may order or direct at any time such medical or other examination as it shall deem necessary to determine the facts relative to the nature and degree of disability of any teacher retired on an annuity under this section.\n\n(b-1) Any initiation, termination, or change of annuity payments made under subsection (b) of this section shall be subject to review and final determination by the District of Columbia Retirement Board.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if during any calendar year an annuitant who is receiving a disability annuity under this section and who has not reached retirement age (as defined in § 38-2021.03) receives income from wages or self-employment, or both, in an amount not less then 80% of the current rate of pay of the position occupied by the annuitant before retirement, the annuity of such annuitant shall be terminated by the District of Columbia Retirement Board effective January 1st of the first calendar year after such calendar year, except that this sentence shall not apply with respect to income received during the year in which the annuitant retired.

The life annuity of a teacher making such election, or any portion of such annuity designated by the teacher in writing for such purposes at the time of retirement, shall be reduced by 2 1/2% of so much thereof as does not exceed $3,600 and by 10% of so much thereof as exceeds $3,600. The spouse or domestic partner of a teacher making such election shall be entitled to an annuity equal to 55% of such life annuity, or designated portion thereof, except that if a retired teacher who has elected a reduced annuity as provided in this paragraph or in subsection (d) of this section dies and is survived by a spouse or domestic partner whom he or she married or entered into a domestic partnership with after retirement, such spouse or domestic partner is entitled to an annuity in an amount which would have been paid had the teacher been married to, or in a domestic partnership with, the spouse or domestic partner at the time of retirement, but only if: (A) such spouse or domestic partner was married to, or in a domestic partnership with, such individual for at least 2 years immediately preceding the teacher’s death, or is the mother or father of issue of such marriage or domestic partnership; and (B) such spouse or domestic partner elects this annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which he or she may be entitled under this part or another retirement system for employees of the federal or District government.

Such annuity and any right thereto shall terminate on the last day of the month before: (A) the spouse or domestic partner dies; or (B) the spouse or domestic partner remarries or enters into a domestic partnership before becoming 55 years of age. In the case of a surviving spouse or domestic partner whose annuity under this paragraph is terminated because of remarriage or entry into a domestic partnership before becoming 55 years of age, annuity at the same rate shall be restored commencing on the day the remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce, or the day the domestic partnership is terminated in accordance with § 32-702(d), or § 16-904(e), if:\n\n(i) The surviving spouse or domestic partner elects to receive the annuity which was terminated instead of a survivor benefit to which the surviving spouse or domestic partner may be entitled, under this part or another retirement system for employees of the federal or District government, by reason of the remarriage or entry into a domestic partnership; and\n\n(ii) Any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is repaid to the Custodian of Retirement Funds (as defined in § 1-702(6) for deposit in the District of Columbia Teachers’ Retirement Fund established by § 1-713(a).\n\n(2) If unmarried, not in a domestic partnership, and in good health, a reduced annuity payable to him during his life, and an annuity after his death payable to a survivor annuitant having an insurable interest in such teacher, duly designated in writing and filed with the District of Columbia Retirement Board at the time of retirement, during the life of such survivor annuitant equal to 55% of such reduced annuity. The annuity of the survivor annuitant shall commence on the day after the retired teacher dies, and such annuity and any right thereto shall terminate on the last day of the month before the death of the survivor annuitant. The annuity hereunder payable to the teacher shall be 90% of the life annuity otherwise payable if the survivor annuitant is the same age or older than the annuitant, or is less than 5 years younger than the annuitant; 85% if the survivor annuitant is 5 but less than 10 years younger; 80% if the survivor annuitant is 10 but less than 15 years younger; 75% if the survivor annuitant is 15 but less than 20 years younger; 70% if the survivor annuitant is 20 but less than 25 years younger; and 60% if the survivor annuitant is 25 or more years younger. No such election shall be valid until the retiring teacher shall have satisfactorily passed a physical examination under the direction of the Director of the Department of Human Services of the District of Columbia, as prescribed by the Board of Education. No person shall be eligible to receive an annuity under subsection (b) of § 38-2021.09 based upon the service of the same teacher covering the same period of time.\n\n(3) A reduced annuity of equivalent value providing for a life-insurance benefit payable in a lump sum at the time of the annuitant’s death. The face amount of such life insurance may be in any amount which the retiring teacher shall designate at the time of retirement but shall not exceed his contributions accumulated with interest to the date of retirement. Payment of such insurance shall be made in accordance with the provisions of § 38-2021.10. Any annuitant who elects to receive the reduced annuity with fixed life-insurance benefits may reconvert the value of the life insurance to an additional annuity of equivalent value on any anniversary of the retirement date of said annuitant prior to reaching age 70.\n\n(4) In the event an individual designated as a surviving spouse or domestic partner or as a survivor annuitant under this subsection predeceases the teacher designating such individual, the annuity of such teacher shall, effective the day after the death of such individual, be the amount it would have been if no such beneficiary had been named.\n\n(A) The annuity of any person who now or hereafter is receiving or entitled to receive an annuity from the Teachers’ Retirement and Annuity Fund shall be increased, effective on October 1, 1955, or on the commencing date of the annuity, whichever is later, in accordance with the following schedule:\n\n(B) Such increase in annuity shall not exceed the sum necessary to increase such annuity, exclusive of annuity purchased by voluntary contributions under this section, to $4,104. The monthly installment of each annuity so increased shall be fixed at the nearest dollar.\n\n(2) The increases provided by this subsection, when added to the annuities of retired employees, shall not operate to increase the annuities of their survivors, except that the annuity of any such survivor who becomes entitled to annuity shall be increased by the per centum provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection appropriate to the commencing date of such survivors annuity.\n\n(d) A teacher who is unmarried and not in a domestic partnership at the time of retiring under a provision of law which permits election of a reduced annuity with a survivor annuity payable to his spouse or domestic partner and who later marries or enters into a domestic partnership may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing filed with the District of Columbia Retirement Board within one year after he or she marries or enters into a domestic partnership, a reduction in his or her current annuity and an annuity after death payable to his or her surviving spouse or domestic partner as provided in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section. The reduced annuity is effective the first day of the month after such election is received by the District of Columbia Retirement Board. The election voids prospectively any election previously made under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, other than this subsection, the monthly rate of annuity payable under this section shall not be less than the smallest primary insurance amount, including any cost-of-living increase added to that amount, authorized to be paid from time to time under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 401 et seq.].\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, other than this subsection, the monthly rate of annuity payable under this section to a surviving child shall not be less than the smallest primary insurance amount, including any cost-of-living increase added to that amount, authorized to be paid from time to time under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 401 et seq.], or 3 times such primary insurance amount divided by the number of surviving children entitled to an annuity, whichever is the lesser.\n\n(3) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to an annuitant or to a survivor who is or becomes entitled to receive from the United States, or the District of Columbia, an annuity or retired pay under any other civilian or military retirement system, benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 401 et seq.], a pension, veterans’ compensation, or any other periodic payment of a similar nature, when the monthly rate thereof is equal to or greater than the smallest primary insurance amount, including any cost-of-living increase added to that amount, authorized to be paid from time to time under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 401 et seq.].\n\n(4) An annuity payable from the Teachers’ Retirement and Annuity Fund to a former teacher, which is based on a separation occurring prior to October 20, 1969, is increased by $240.\n\n(5) In lieu of any increase based on an increase under paragraph (4) of this subsection, an annuity payable from the Teachers’ Retirement and Annuity Fund to the surviving spouse of a teacher or annuitant, which is based on a separation occurring prior to October 20, 1969, shall be increased by $132.\n\n(6) The monthly rate of an annuity resulting from an increase under paragraph (4) or (5) of this subsection shall be considered as the monthly rate of annuity payable under subsection (a) of this section for purposes of computing the minimum annuity under this subsection.\n\n(f) Each year, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall set the applicable interest rate, mortality table, and cost-of-living factor to be used in the determination of actuarial equivalents or for other pertinent benefit calculations under the provisions of this part.",

The provisions of this section shall apply only to the extent required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code as applied to a governmental plan, and if any special rules for governmental plans are not set forth in this section, these special rules are incorporated by reference and shall for all purposes be deemed a part of this part.\n\n(1) The teacher’s entire interest shall be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the teacher no later than April 1 following the later of the calendar year in which the teacher attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the teacher retires or terminates employment (the “required beginning date”).\n\n(2) If the teacher dies before distributions begin, the teacher’s entire interest shall be distributed, or shall begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:\n\n(A) If the teacher’s surviving spouse is the sole designated beneficiary, distributions to the surviving spouse shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the teacher died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the teacher would have attained age 701/2, if later;\n\n(B) If the teacher’s surviving spouse is not the sole designated beneficiary, distributions to the designated beneficiary shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the teacher died;\n\n(C) If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the teacher’s death, the teacher’s entire interest shall be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year of the 5th anniversary of the teacher’s death;\n\n(D) If the teacher’s surviving spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the teacher but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply, and subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the teacher. For the purposes of this paragraph and subsection (d) of this section, distributions are considered to begin on the teacher’s required beginning date or, if this subparagraph applies, the date distributions to the surviving spouse are required to begin under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. If annuity payments to the teacher irrevocably commence before the teacher’s required beginning date or to the teacher’s surviving spouse before the date distributions to the surviving spouse are required to begin under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.\n\n(3) Unless the teacher’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution, calendar year distributions shall be made in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) of this section. If the teacher’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions under the annuity shall be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations. A part of the teacher’s interest that is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts.\n\n(1) The amount of the annuity is to be determined each year.\n\n(2) If the teacher’s interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions, payments under the annuity shall satisfy the following requirements:\n\n(A) The annuity distributions shall be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year;\n\n(B) Payments shall either be non-increasing or increase only as follows:\n\n(i) By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index based on prices of all items (the CPI-W) and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics;\n\n(ii) To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the teacher’s death;\n\n(iii) To pay increased benefits that result from an amendment to this part.\n\n(3) The amount that must be distributed on or before the teacher’s required beginning date or, if the teacher dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection (b)(2)(A) or (B) of this section, is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received (for example, bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually). The teacher’s benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year shall be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the teacher’s required beginning date.\n\n(4) Additional benefits accruing to the teacher in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year shall be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the amount accrues.\n\n(d) Amounts payable if a teacher dies before distribution begins are subject to the following requirements:\n\n(1) If the teacher dies before the date of distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the teacher’s entire interest shall be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subsection (b)(2)(A) or (B) of this section, over the life of the designated beneficiary not exceeding either of the following:\n\n(A) Unless the benefit commenced is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, determined using the beneficiary’s age as of the beneficiary’s birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the teacher’s death; or\n\n(B) If the benefit commenced before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, determined using the beneficiary’s age as of his or her birthday in the calendar year that begins before benefits commence;\n\n(2) If the teacher dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the teacher’s death, distribution of the teacher’s entire interest shall be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the 5th anniversary of the teacher’s death; or\n\n(3) If the teacher dies before the date distribution of the teacher’s interest begins, the teacher’s surviving spouse is the teacher’s sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the teacher, except that the time by which distributions must begin shall be determined without regard to subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section.",

A teacher or former teacher who returns to duty after a period of separation is deemed, for the purpose of this section, to have been on a leave of absence without pay for that part of the period in which he or she was receiving benefits under subchapter I of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 81, or any earlier statute on which the subchapter is based. In computing an annuity under § 38-2021.05(a), the total service of a teacher shall include days of unused sick leave credited to him. No deposit may be required for days of unused sick leave included in a teacher’s total service under the preceding sentence. Days of unused sick leave shall not be counted in determining a teacher’s average salary or his eligibility for an annuity.

Such annuity and any right thereto shall terminate on the last day of the month before: (A) the surviving spouse or domestic partner dies; or (B) the surviving spouse or domestic partner remarries or enters a new domestic partnership before becoming 55 years of age. In the case of a surviving spouse or domestic partner whose annuity under this paragraph is terminated because of remarriage or entry into a new domestic partnership before becoming 55 years of age, annuity at the same rate shall be restored commencing on the day the remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce, or the new domestic partnership is terminated in accordance with § 32-702(d), or § 16-904(e), if:\n\n(i) The surviving spouse or domestic partner elects to receive the annuity which was terminated instead of a survivor benefit to which the surviving spouse or domestic partner may be entitled, under this part or another retirement system for employees of the federal or District government, by reason of the remarriage or new domestic partnership; and\n\n(ii) Any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is repaid to the Custodian of Retirement Funds (as defined in § 1-702(6), for deposit in the District of Columbia Teachers’ Retirement Fund established by § 1-713(a).\n\n(2) If any teacher to whom this part applies shall die after completing at least 18 months of eligible service or after having retired under the provisions of § 38-2021.03 or § 38-2021.04 and is survived by a spouse or domestic partner, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smallest of: (A) sixty per centum of the teacher’s average salary divided by the number of children; (B) $ 900; or (C) $ 2,700 divided by the number of children. If such teacher is not survived by a spouse or domestic partner, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smallest of: (A) seventy-five per centum of the teacher’s average salary divided by the number of children; (B) $ 1,080; or (C) $ 3,240 divided by the number of children. The child’s annuity shall commence on the first day after the teacher dies. Such annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the child: (i) becomes 18 years of age unless he is then a student as described or incapable of self-support; (ii) becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless he or she is then such a student; (iii) becomes 22 years of age if he or she is then such a student and capable of self-support; (iv) ceases to be such a student after becoming 18 years of age unless he or she is then incapable of self-support; or (v) dies or marries; whichever first occurs. Upon the death of the surviving spouse or domestic partner or termination of the annuity of the child, the annuity of any other child or children shall be recomputed and paid as though such spouse, domestic partner, or child had not survived the teacher.\n\n(3) In the event any teacher to whom this part applies shall die subsequent to March 6, 1952, after completing at least 18 months of eligible service, and is not survived by a spouse, domestic partner, or children, but is survived by dependent parents or a dependent father or a dependent mother, such surviving dependent parents or parent shall be paid an annuity, beginning the first day of the month following the death of the teacher, equal to 55% of the amount of an annuity computed as provided in subsection (a) of § 38-2021.05 with respect to such teacher, except that, in the computation of the annuity under such subsection, the annuity of the teacher shall be at least the smaller of 40% of his average salary, or the sum obtained under such subsection after increasing his eligible service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of death and the date he would have become 60 years of age; provided, that such payments shall be made jointly to surviving dependent parents and payment of such annuity shall continue after the death of either dependent parent; provided further, that all such payments or any right thereto shall cease upon the death of both dependent parents.\n\n(4) In the event that a teacher to whom this part applies shall die after January 1, 2007, while performing qualified military service, the survivor or survivors of the teacher shall be entitled to receive any additional benefits provided under this part (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the teacher resumed employment and then terminated employment on account of death.\n\n(b-1) Effective as of January 1, 2007, benefits payable under this part shall not be paid until at least 30 days, or a shorter period as may be permitted by law, but no more than 180 days after a teacher’s receipt of required distribution notices and election forms pursuant to section 402(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. The notices must include a description of the teacher’s right, if any, to defer receipt of a distribution, the consequences of failing to defer receipt of the distribution, the relative value of optional forms of benefit, and other information as may be required by applicable regulations and guidance.\n\n(c) As used in this section:\n\n(1) The term “spouse” means a surviving wife or husband of an individual, who either shall have been married to such individual for at least 2 years immediately preceding the individual’s death, or is the mother or father of issue by such marriage.\n\n(2) The term “child” means:\n\n(A) An unmarried child under 18 years of age, including:\n\n(i) An adopted child; and:\n\n(ii) A stepchild or recognized natural child who lived with the teacher in a regular parent-child relationship;\n\n(B) Such unmarried child regardless of age who is incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability incurred before age 18; or\n\n(C) Such unmarried child between 18 and 22 years of age who is a student regularly pursuing a full-time course of study or training in residence in a high school, trade school, technical or vocational institute, junior college, college, university, or comparable recognized educational institution. For the purpose of this paragraph and paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section, a child whose 22nd birthday occurs before July 1st or after August 31st of a calendar year, and while he is regularly pursuing such a course of study or training, is deemed to have become 22 years of age on the 1st day of July after that birthday. A child who is a student is deemed not to have ceased to be a student during an interim between school years if the interim is not more than 5 months and if he shows to the satisfaction of the District of Columbia Retirement Board that he has a bona fide intention of continuing to pursue a course of study or training in the same or different school during the school semester (or other period into which the school year is divided) immediately after the interim.\n\n(3) The term “dependent parents” means the natural parents of a teacher who were receiving one half or more of their total income from said teacher immediately preceding the death of said teacher.\n\n(4) The term “dependent father” or “dependent mother” means the natural father or natural mother of a teacher who was receiving one half or more of his or her total income from said teacher immediately preceding the death of said teacher.\n\n(5) Repealed.\n\n(6) Questions of dependency and disability arising under this section shall be determined by the District of Columbia Retirement Board and its decisions with respect to such matters shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to review.\n\n(7) The term “domestic partner” shall have the same meaning as provided in § 32-701(3), and who shall have been a domestic partner with such individual for at least 2 years immediately preceding his death.\n\n(8) The term “qualified military service” shall mean any military service in the uniformed services, as defined in 38 U.S.C. § 43, by a teacher, if the teacher is entitled to reemployment rights with respect to such military service, all within the meaning of section 414(u)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code.",

Any nontaxable distribution or portion thereof from a qualified plan may be directly rolled over tax-free to another qualified plan or a plan or annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, if separate accounting and other requirements are met pursuant to section 402(c)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(b) The Custodian of the Retirement Funds shall be entrusted with any transfer from another retirement plan for the purchase of service credit, including transfers allowed by sections 403(b) and 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Before any transfer is received, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall be presented with documentation sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 governing the substantiation of proposed transfers for the purchase of service credit.\n\n(1) The Custodian of the Retirement Funds shall also be entrusted with any rollover contribution from an eligible retirement plan, including:\n\n(A) A qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, excluding after-tax employee contributions;\n\n(B) An annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, excluding after-tax employee contributions;\n\n(C) An eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state; or\n\n(D) Amounts transferred from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is eligible to be rolled over and would otherwise be includible in gross income.\n\n(2) The rollover shall be separately accounted for as member contributions that were not previously taxed. Before any rollover is received, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall be presented with documentation sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 governing the substantiation of proposed rollover contributions. The rollover shall be used to purchase service credit in addition to the service credit provided under the provisions of this part.\n\n(d) The District of Columbia Retirement Board shall administer this part in the manner required to satisfy the applicable qualification requirements for a qualified governmental plan pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If a conflict should arise with a qualification requirement, the provision shall be interpreted in favor of maintaining the federal qualification requirements. The District of Columbia Retirement Board may adopt rules to implement this section.\n\n(e) For the purposes of this section, the term:\n\n(1) “Direct rollover” means a payment to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee described in section 402(e)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(2) “Distributee” means a teacher or former teacher. In addition, the teacher’ or former teacher’s surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. A nonspouse beneficiary of a deceased teacher is also a distributee for purposes of this section; provided, that, in the case of a nonspouse beneficiary, the direct rollover may be made only to an individual retirement account or annuity under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code that is established on behalf of the nonspouse beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code. The determination of the extent to which a distribution to a nonspouse beneficiary is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be made in accordance with IRS Notice 2007-7, Q&A 17 and 18, 2007-5 I.R.B. 395.\n\n(3) “Eligible retirement plan” means:\n\n(A) An individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, including a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n(B) An individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, including a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n(C) A qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution;\n\n(D) An annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution; and\n\n(E) An eligible plan described in section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state, that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution and agrees to account separately for amounts transferred into such plan from the arrangement described under this part. The foregoing definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order.\n\n(4) “Eligible rollover distribution,” within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:\n\n(A) A distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more; and\n\n(B) A distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. A distribution to a nonspouse beneficiary under section 401(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code is an eligible rollover distribution. A portion of the distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includible in gross income. However, the portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code or to a qualified trust or annuity plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code if the trust or annuity plan or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.",

This provision shall apply only with respect to an individual who first receives benefits under [this part]* on or after October 1, 2002.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this part to the contrary, benefits under this part are subject to the limitations imposed by section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as adjusted from time to time and, to that end, effective for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2008:\n\n(A) To the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and subject to the remainder of this subsection, the maximum monthly benefit to which any teacher may be entitled in any limitation year with respect to his or her accrued retirement benefit, as adjusted from time to time pursuant to § 38-2021.21 (hereafter referred to as the “maximum benefit”), shall not exceed the defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted as provided in this subsection). In addition to the foregoing, to the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and subject to this subsection), the maximum annual additions for any limitation year shall be equal to the lesser of:\n\n(i) The dollar limit on annual additions; or\n\n(ii) 100% of the teacher’s remuneration.\n\n(B) The defined benefit dollar limit and the dollar limit on annual additions shall be adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe. The dollar limit as adjusted under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies, but a teacher’s benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit before January 1 of that calendar year. To the extent that the monthly benefit payable to a teacher who has reached his or her termination date is limited by the application of this subsection, the limit shall be adjusted to reflect subsequent adjustments made in accordance with section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, but the adjusted limit shall apply only to benefits payable on or after January 1 of the calendar year for which the adjustment applies.\n\n(2) Benefits shall be actuarially adjusted based upon the defined benefit dollar limit, as follows:\n\n(A) There shall be an adjustment for benefits payable in a form other than a straight life annuity as follows:\n\n(i) If a monthly benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, before applying the defined benefit dollar limit, the benefit shall be adjusted, in the manner described in sub-subparagraphs (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, to the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that begins at the same time. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits), or in the case of a form of benefit not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, the inclusion of a feature under which a benefit increases automatically to the extent permitted to reflect cost-of-living adjustments and the increase, if any, in the defined benefit dollar limit under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(ii) If the benefit of a teacher is paid in a form not subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity (without regard to cost-of-living adjustments described in this subsection) is equal to the greater of the annual amount of the straight life annuity, if any, payable to the teacher commencing at the same time, or the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher’s form of benefit, computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(iii) If the benefit of a teacher is paid in a form subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greatest of:\n\n(I) The annual amount of the straight life annuity having a commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher’s form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the definition of actuarial equivalent for adjusting benefits in the same form;\n\n(II) The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the time that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher’s form of benefit, computed using a 5.5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; or\n\n(III) The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher’s form of benefit, computed using the applicable interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, divided by 1.05.\n\n(iv) For the purposes of this subparagraph, whether a form of benefit is subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code is determined without regard to the status of this part as a government plan as described in section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(B) There shall be an adjustment to benefits that commence before age 62 or after age 65 as follows:\n\n(i) If the benefit of a teacher begins before age 62, the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the teacher at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the teacher at age 62 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the benefit provided under this part provides an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:\n\n(I) The limitation determined under the immediately preceding sentence; or\n\n(II) The defined benefit dollar limit, adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable, multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at the age of benefit commencement to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. The adjustment in this sub-subparagraph shall not apply as a result of benefits paid on account of disability under § 38-2021.04 or as a result of the death of a teacher under § 38-2021.09.\n\n(ii) If the benefit of a teacher begins after age 65, the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the teacher at the later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the defined benefit dollar limit applicable at age 65 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the benefit provided under this part provides an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:\n\n(I) The limitation determined under the immediately preceding sentence; or\n\n(II) The defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted for participation of less than 10 years, if applicable) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at the age of benefit commencement to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at the age the benefit commences is the annual amount of the annuity payable to the teacher, computed disregarding the teacher’s accruals after age 65 but including any actuarial adjustments, even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under this part to a hypothetical teacher who is age 65 and has the same annuity as the teacher.\n\n(iii) For the purposes of this subparagraph, no adjustment shall be made to the defined benefit dollar limit to reflect the probability of a teacher’s death between the commencing date and age 62, or between age 65 and the commencing date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the teacher before the annuity having a commencing date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the date the benefits first commence, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the teacher’s death if the benefit provided under this part does not charge the teacher for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined for purposes of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code) upon the teacher’s death.\n\n(3) If the teacher has fewer than 10 years of participation in the defined benefit portion of this part (as determined under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and associated regulations), the defined benefit dollar limit shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation under this part and the denominator of which is 10. The adjustment in this paragraph shall not apply to benefits paid on account of disability under § 38-2021.04(d) or as a result of the death of a teacher under § 38-2021.09. In the case of years of credited service credited to a teacher pursuant to § 38-2021.08:\n\n(A) The limitations contained in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection and this paragraph shall not apply to the portion of the teacher’s accrued retirement benefit (determined as of the annuity commencement date) that is attributable to any additional years of credited service under § 38-2021.08 that are actuarially funded by:\n\n(i) A transfer or rollover from the teacher’s account under a retirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an eligible deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code or from an individual retirement account; or\n\n(ii) A direct payment.\n\n(B) The limitations contained in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection and this paragraph shall apply to the portion of the teacher’s accrued retirement benefit (determined as of the annuity commencement date) that is attributable to any additional years of credited service under § 38-2021.08 that are not actuarially funded by:\n\n(i) A transfer or rollover from the teacher’s account under a retirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an eligible deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code) or from an individual retirement account; or\n\n(ii) A direct payment.\n\n(C) The determination of the extent to which additional years of credited service under § 38-2021.08 have been actuarially funded as of the annuity commencement date shall be determined in accordance with section 411(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (using the actuarial assumptions thereunder), applied as if section 411(c) of the Internal Revenue Code applied and treating the amount transferred from a plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the teacher’s account under an eligible deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code), or an individual retirement account, or the amount of the direct lump-sum payment to the Custodian of Retirement Funds, as if it were a mandatory employee contribution.\n\n(4) In addition to the foregoing, the maximum benefit and contributions shall be reduced, and the rate of benefit accrual shall be frozen or reduced accordingly, to the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to any teacher who is also a participant in:\n\n(A) Any other tax-qualified retirement plan maintained by the District of Columbia, including a defined benefit plan in which an individual medical benefit account, as described in section 415(l) of the Internal Revenue Code, has been established for the teacher;\n\n(B) A welfare plan maintained by the District of Columbia in which a separate account, as described in section 419A(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, has been established to provide post-retirement medical benefits for the teacher; or\n\n(C) A retirement or welfare plan, as aforesaid, maintained by an affiliated or predecessor employer, as described in regulations under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, or otherwise required to be taken into account under such regulations.\n\n(5) If a teacher has distributions commencing at more than one date determined in accordance with section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and associated regulations, the annuity payable having the commencement date shall satisfy the limitations of this subsection as of each date, actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other dates that benefits commence.\n\n(6) The application of the provisions of this subsection shall not cause the maximum permissible benefit for a teacher to be less than the teacher’s annuity under this part as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007 under provisions of this part that were both adopted and in effect before April 5, 2007 and that satisfied the limitations under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007.\n\n(7) To the extent that a teacher’s benefit is subject to provisions of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code that have not been set forth in this part, these provisions are hereby incorporated by reference and for all purposes shall be deemed a part of this part.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, all death benefit payments referred to in this section shall be distributed only in accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and accompanying Treasury regulations, as more fully set forth in § 38-2021.07a.\n\n(d) For the purposes of this section, the term:\n\n(1) “Annual additions” means the sum of the following items credited to the teacher under this part and any other tax-qualified retirement plan sponsored by the District of Columbia for a limitation year and treated as a defined contribution plan for purposes of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code: District of Columbia contributions that are separately allocated to the teacher’s credit in any defined contribution plan; forfeitures; teacher contributions (other than contributions that are picked up by the District of Columbia as described in section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code); and amounts credited after March 31, 1984 to a teacher’s individual medical account (within the meaning of section 415(l) of the Internal Revenue Code).\n\n(2) “Defined benefit dollar limit” means the dollar limit imposed by section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. The defined benefit dollar limit as set forth above is the monthly amount payable in the form of a straight life annuity, beginning no earlier than age 62 (except as provided in subsection (b)(2)(B)(i)) of this section and no later than age 65. In the case of a monthly amount payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, or beginning before age 62 or after age 65, the adjustments in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall apply.\n\n(3) “Dollar limit” means the dollar limit on annual additions imposed by section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(4) “Remuneration” means a teacher’s wages as defined in section 3401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and all other payments of salary to the teacher from the public schools of the District of Columbia for which the public schools of the District of Columbia is required to furnish the teacher a written statement under sections 6041(d) and 6051(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose:\n\n(A) Remuneration shall be determined without regard to any rules that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed.\n\n(B) Remuneration does not include mandatory employee contributions picked up by the public schools of the District of Columbia pursuant to section 1.\n\n(C) Remuneration shall include an amount that would otherwise be deemed remuneration under this definition but for the fact that it is subject to a salary reduction agreement under a plan described in section 457(b), 132(f) or 125 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(D) Remuneration with respect to any limitation year shall in no event exceed the dollar limit specified in section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code (as adjusted from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury). The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to remuneration for the limitation year that begins with or within such calendar year.",
