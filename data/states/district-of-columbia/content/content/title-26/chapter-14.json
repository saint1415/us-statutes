An investment described in § 26-1401.14 shall not be included in the computation of the 15% and 50% limitations.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this subsection and of § 26-1401.09(a)(7), the term “housing project” shall mean the development or redevelopment of home sites or housing for sale or rental, including projects for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or rebuilding of residential properties to meet the minimum standards of health and occupancy, the provision of accommodations for retail stores and other community services that are reasonably related, or incident, to the housing project, and the stock of a corporation that owns a housing project and that is wholly owned by one or more financial institutions.\n\n(f) Except as provided in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, a universal bank may make an investment under § 26-1401.09(a)(3) through (8), directly or through a subsidiary, unless the Commissioner determines that such investment shall be made through a subsidiary or with appropriate safeguards to limit the risk exposure of the universal bank.\n\n(1) A universal bank shall not purchase or hold more than 10% of its own capital stock, notes, or debentures; provided that:\n\n(A) A universal bank may purchase or hold more than 10% of its own capital stock, notes, or debentures, if approved by the Commissioner consistent with safe and sound practices; and\n\n(B) A universal bank may purchase or hold more than 10% of its own capital stock, notes, or debentures if the purchase is necessary to prevent loss upon a debt previously contracted in good faith; provided further, that:\n\n(i) The universal bank shall sell or cancel the stock, notes, or debentures held or purchased under this subparagraph within 12 months of acquisition; and\n\n(ii) Stocks, notes, or debentures held or purchased under this subparagraph shall not be held by the universal bank for more than 6 months if the stock, notes, or debentures can be sold for the amount of the claim of the universal bank against the holder of the debt previously contracted.\n\n(2) Cancellation of stock, notes, or debentures under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall reduce the amount of the universal bank’s capital stock, notes, or debentures. If the reduction reduces the universal bank’s capital below the minimum level required by the Commissioner, the universal bank shall increase its capital to the amount required by the Commissioner.",
