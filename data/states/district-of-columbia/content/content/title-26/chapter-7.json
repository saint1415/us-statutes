In no event shall the amount of loans and extension of credit be less than $50,000,000 or required to be made more than $100,000,000, though an applicant may agree to make loans and extend credit in target economic development projects in excess of $100,000,000, and the loans shall not include temporary financing, general obligation bonds issued by the District government, or the purchase of an interest in a pool of mortgage loans, such as mortgage participation certificates issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Government National Mortgage Association, or the Farmers Home Administration;\n\n(2) The applicant will establish at least 2 bank offices in target banking development areas, in addition to any acquired bank offices, within 3 years following the date of acquisition of a District bank or District bank holding company;\n\n(3) The applicant will cash checks issued by the District and the United States governments at bank offices within target banking development areas, even though the bearer of the check does not maintain an account at the bank.

The letter of credit shall be established as of the date when the applicant submits its application to the Superintendent.\n\n(2) In place of an irrevocable and confirmed letter of credit, the Superintendent [Commissioner] may authorize the use of any other financial instrument which would assure payment of fines assessed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(d) The Superintendent [Commissioner] may reduce or extend the time within which a bank holding company shall satisfy any commitment made in connection with an application filed pursuant to this section, if the Superintendent [Commissioner] finds that the commitment was contingent upon certain action to be taken by the District and the District does not take the action, or, upon good cause shown, the economic or financial conditions of the bank holding company justifies the action.\n\n(e) Any District bank holding company or District bank may choose not to be acquired pursuant to this section by having a resolution to that effect passed by its board of directors and shareholders. The resolution shall be forwarded to the Superintendent [Commissioner] within 60 days after its adoption.

In all events, at the end of 3 years following the acquisition of a District bank or a District bank holding company under this section, the Superintendent [Commissioner] shall review the activities of the nonregional bank holding company making the acquisition, and of its District bank subsidiaries, and shall determine whether the nonregional bank holding company has fulfilled, and is continuing to fulfill, the commitments set forth in subsection (b) of this section.

The Superintendent [Commissioner] may extend this specified reasonable period of time.\n\n(3) If, 30 days after the date specified for compliance by an order issued pursuant to this subsection, including any extension, the Superintendent [Commissioner] believes that the bank holding company has not complied with the order, the Superintendent [Commissioner] shall hold a hearing pursuant to § 2-509, to determine whether the bank holding company has failed to comply with the order.
