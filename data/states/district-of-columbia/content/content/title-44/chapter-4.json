Only those institutional health services or capital expenditures that are granted a certificate of need shall be offered, developed, or obligated within the District.\n\n(b) Before there is a capital expenditure in any amount to acquire, either by purchase or under a lease or comparable arrangement, of an existing HCF or part of a HCF (“Transaction”), the person or persons acquiring control (“Proposed Owner”) shall obtain a certificate of need from SHPDA. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (5), (6), (7) and (8) of this subsection, SHPDA shall waive the procedures and review criteria set forth under § 44-409 and shall grant a certificate of need if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) The Proposed Owner shall provide written notification to SHPDA at least 60 days before the Transaction.

If, by the 60th day, the Proposed Owner has not provided the required notification or addressed SHPDA’s proposed negative findings, SHPDA shall, upon request by the Proposed Owner, provide the Proposed Owner a reasonable opportunity to provide additional information to SHPDA, to participate in the required hearing, or to complete its required notice in order to cure any negative finding. SHPDA shall act upon such additional submission within 15 days. If the Proposed Owner does not respond to the SHPDA notice of deficiency within 6 months of the notification from SHPDA, SHPDA shall close the proceeding. If, following submission by the Proposed Owner, SHPDA finds by clear and convincing evidence that any one or more of these standards is not met, SHPDA shall require that the Proposed Owner obtain a certificate of need in accordance with the provisions of § 44-409, except that the letter of intent and public hearing requirements shall be waived. If no action is taken by SHPDA within the initial prescribed 60-day time frame, the certificate of need shall be deemed to be issued and approved on the 61st day following the filing of the notification required in subsection (b)(1) of this section. If no action is taken by SHPDA within the additional 15-day time frame provided following an additional submission by the Proposed Owner under subsection (b)(5) of this section, the certificate of need shall be deemed to be issued and approved on the 16th day following the filing of the additional submission under this subsection (b)(5) of this section.\n\n(7) In granting a certificate of need under this subsection, SHPDA shall impose no application or process requirements, apply any review criteria, or impose any conditions except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(8) The Office of Attorney General for the District of Columbia may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction if it determines that a person is operating an HCF in violation of the certifications made under this subsection.\n\n(9) The requirements of this subsection shall be effective without adoption by SHPDA of implementing regulations.\n\n(c) Any person proposing to close permanently or to terminate operation of a HCF or health service shall notify the SHPDA of the intention to close or terminate operation no later than 90 days prior to the proposed closing, and obtains its approval, and shall provide the SHPDA with any information that may be requested as established in the rules promulgated to implement the provisions of this chapter. The information shall include, but not be limited to, the reasons for the closure or termination of operation, the number of patients to be affected by the closure, and the provisions being made to provide for their continuing care. When notice of closure of a HCF or health service is received, the SHPDA shall provide assistance for an orderly transition of the patient load to the extent possible, which may include organizing meetings with affected stakeholders and providing planning and technical assistance for possible patient load transition, and, if the notice of closure is approved by SHPDA, continue to assist in the orderly transition by overseeing the placement of patients into new HCFs in a manner that ensures that the health and well-being of the patients is protected.\n\n(d) A conversion or acquiring of effective control, as defined in § 44-401(1), of a nonprofit HCF shall not be approved by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia unless charitable assets of the HCF have been adequately protected pursuant to the provisions of the Healthcare Entity Conversion Act of 1997.",
