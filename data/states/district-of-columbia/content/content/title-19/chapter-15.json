A fiduciary may disclaim the interest or power even if its creator imposed a spendthrift provision or similar restriction on transfer or a restriction or limitation on the right to disclaim, or an instrument other than the instrument that created the fiduciary relationship imposed a restriction or limitation on the right to disclaim.\n\n(1) To be effective, a disclaimer must:\n\n(A) Be in a writing or other record;\n\n(B) Declare the disclaimer;\n\n(C) Describe the interest or power disclaimed;\n\n(D) Be signed by the person making the disclaimer; and\n\n(E) Be delivered or filed in the manner provided in § 19-1512.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this subsection, the term:\n\n(A) “Record” means information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.\n\n(B) “Signed” means, with present intent to authenticate or adopt a record, to:\n\n(i) Execute or adopt a tangible symbol; or\n\n(ii) Attach to or logically associate with the record an electronic sound, symbol, or process.\n\n(d) A partial disclaimer may be expressed as a fraction, percentage, monetary amount, term of years, limitation of a power, or any other interest or estate in the property.\n\n(e) A disclaimer becomes irrevocable when it is delivered or filed pursuant to § 19-1512 or when it becomes effective as provided in §§ 19-1506 through 19-1511, whichever occurs later.\n\n(f) A disclaimer made under this chapter is not a transfer, assignment, or release.",

If no descendant of the disclaimant survives the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest passes to those persons, including the state but excluding the disclaimant, and in such shares as would succeed to the transferor’s intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the transferor’s domicile had the transferor died at the time of distribution. However, if the transferor’s surviving spouse is living but is remarried at the time of distribution, the transferor is deemed to have died unmarried at the time of distribution.\n\n(4) Upon the disclaimer of a preceding interest, a future interest held by a person other than the disclaimant takes effect as if the disclaimant had died or ceased to exist immediately before the time of distribution, but a future interest held by the disclaimant is not accelerated in possession or enjoyment.",
