If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of this chapter other than this section, for the exclusion from the gift tax described in 26 U.S.C. § 2503(b) by application of 26 U.S.C. § 2503(c), the second-trust instrument must not include or omit a term that, if included or omitted from the trust instrument for the trust to which the property was transferred, would have prevented the transfer from qualifying under 26 U.S.C. § 2503(c).\n\n(4) If the property of the first trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation, as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 1361 and the first trust is, or but for provisions of this chapter other than this section would be, a permitted shareholder under any provision of 26 U.S.C. § 1361, an authorized fiduciary may exercise the power with respect to part or all of the S-corporation stock only if any second trust receiving the stock is a permitted shareholder under 26 U.S.C. § 1361(c)(2). If the property of the first trust includes shares of stock in an S corporation and the first trust is, or but for provisions of this chapter other than this section would be, a qualified subchapter-S trust within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 1361(d), the second-trust instrument must not include or omit a term that prevents the second trust from qualifying as a qualified subchapter-S trust.\n\n(5) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or would have qualified but for provisions of this chapter other than this section, for a zero inclusion ratio for purposes of the generation-skipping transfer tax under 26 U.S.C. § 2642(c), the second-trust instrument must not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have prevented the transfer to the first trust from qualifying for a zero inclusion ratio under 26 U.S.C. § 2642(c).\n\n(6) If the first trust is directly or indirectly the beneficiary of qualified benefits property, the second-trust instrument may not include or omit any term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have increased the minimum distributions required with respect to the qualified benefits property under 26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(9) and any applicable regulations, or any similar requirements that refer to 26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(9) or the regulations. If an attempted exercise of the decanting power violates the preceding sentence, the trustee is deemed to have held the qualified benefits property and any reinvested distributions of the property as a separate share from the date of the exercise of the power and § 19-1922 applies to the separate share.\n\n(7) If the first trust qualifies as a grantor trust because of the application of 26 U.S.C. § 672(f)(2)(A), the second trust may not include or omit a term that, if included in or omitted from the first-trust instrument, would have prevented the first trust from qualifying under 26 U.S.C. § 672(f)(2)(A).\n\n(8) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term \"tax benefit\" means a federal or state tax deduction, exemption, exclusion, or other benefit not otherwise listed in this section, except for a benefit arising from being a grantor trust.
