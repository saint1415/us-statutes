An accommodation would cause an employer undue hardship when it would cause the employer to incur more than de minimis costs.\n\n(2) Such an accommodation may be made by permitting the employee to work:\n\n(A) During the employee’s scheduled lunch time or other work breaks;\n\n(B) Before or after the employee’s usual working hours;\n\n(C) Outside of the employer’s normal business hours;\n\n(D) During the employee’s paid vacation days;\n\n(E) During another employee’s working hours as part of a voluntary swap with such other employee; or\n\n(F) In any other manner that is mutually agreeable to the employer and employee.\n\n(3) When an employee’s request for a particular form of accommodation would cause undue hardship to the employer, the employer shall reasonably accommodate the employee in a manner that does not cause undue hardship to the employer.

The mere assumption that other employees with the same religious beliefs might also request accommodation shall not be considered evidence of undue hardship. An employer that employs 5 or fewer full-time employees shall be exempt from the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(1) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice to do any of the acts prohibited in subsection (a) or (b) of this section based wholly or partially on the fact that:\n\n(A) An employee attended, participated in, prepared for, or requested leave to attend, participate in, or prepare for a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding relating to domestic violence, a sexual offense, or stalking of which the employee or employee's family member was a victim, including meetings with an attorney or law enforcement officials;\n\n(B) An employee sought physical or mental health treatment or counseling relating to domestic violence, a sexual offense, or stalking of which the employee or employee's family member was a victim; or\n\n(C) An individual caused a disruption at the employee's workplace or made a threat to an employee's employment, relating to domestic violence, a sexual offense, or stalking of which the employee or employee's family member was a victim.\n\n(2) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer to refuse to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee who is a victim or a family member of a victim of domestic violence, a sexual offense, or stalking when an accommodation is necessary to ensure the person's security and safety, unless such an accommodation would cause the employer undue hardship.\n\n(A) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer to disclose any information related to an employee's status as a victim or family member of a victim of domestic violence, a sexual offense, or stalking provided to the employer by the employee, including a statement or any other documentation, record, or corroborating evidence.\n\n(B) It shall not be a violation of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to make a disclosure that is:\n\n(i) Requested or voluntarily authorized in writing by the employee;\n\n(ii) Ordered by a court or administrative agency or otherwise required by law;\n\n(iii) Provided to a law enforcement agency;\n\n(iv) Necessary to protect other employees from imminent harm;\n\n(v) To the extent necessary, to provide a reasonable accommodation to the victim; or\n\n(vi) If the employee works in a private residence, necessary to protect residents at the employee's workplace from harm.\n\n(C) In the event of a disclosure, the employer shall notify the employee of the disclosure.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term:\n\n(A) \"Reasonable accommodation\" includes a transfer, reassignment, modified schedule, leave, changed work station, changed work telephone or email address, installed lock, assistance in documenting domestic violence, a sexual offense, or stalking that occurs in the workplace, or the implementation of another safety procedure in response to actual or threatened domestic violence, a sexual offense, or stalking.\n\n(B) \"Undue hardship\" means any action that requires significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to factors such as the size of the employer, its financial resources, and the nature and structure of its operation.\n\n(1) It shall further be an unlawful discriminatory practice to engage in harassment based on one or more protected characteristics specified in subsection (a), including sexual harassment.\n\n(2) For purposes of this subsection:\n\n(A) \"Harassment\" means conduct, whether direct or indirect, verbal or nonverbal, that unreasonably alters an individual's terms, conditions, or privileges of employment or has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.\n\n(B) \"Sexual harassment\" means:\n\n(i) Any conduct of a sexual nature or that is based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression that constitutes harassment as defined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; and\n\n(ii) Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other conduct of a sexual nature where submission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment or where submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision affecting the individual's employment.\n\n(3) In determining whether conduct constitutes unlawful harassment under this subsection, a finder of fact shall consider the totality of the circumstances and view conduct based on multiple protected characteristics in totality, rather than in isolation. Conduct need not be severe or pervasive to constitute harassment and no specific number of incidents or specific level of egregiousness is required. The finder of fact shall consider the following factors; except, that this list shall not be considered exhaustive, and the presence or absence of any single factor shall not be determinative:\n\n(A) The frequency of the conduct;\n\n(B) The duration of the conduct;\n\n(C) The location where the conduct occurred;\n\n(D) Whether the conduct involved threats, slurs, epithets, stereotypes, or humiliating or degrading conduct; and\n\n(E) Whether any party to the conduct held a position of formal authority over or informal power relative to another party.\n\n(4) The finder of fact may find that conduct constitutes unlawful harassment regardless of the following circumstances:\n\n(A) The conduct consisted of a single incident;\n\n(B) The conduct was directed toward a person other than the complainant;\n\n(C) The complainant submitted to or participated in the conduct;\n\n(D) The complainant was able to complete employment responsibilities despite the conduct;\n\n(E) The conduct did not cause tangible physical or psychological injury;\n\n(F) The conduct occurred outside the workplace; or\n\n(G) The conduct was not overtly directed toward a protected characteristic.\n\n(d) Prohibited acts that otherwise would constitute unlawful discriminatory practices based upon the credit information of an individual under subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall not apply:\n\n(1) Where an employer is otherwise required by District law to require, request, suggest, or cause any employee to submit credit information, or use, accept, refer to, or inquire into an employee's credit information.\n\n(2) Where an employee is applying for a position as or is employed as a police officer with the Metropolitan Police Department, as a special police officer or campus police officer appointed pursuant to § 5-129.02(a), or in a position with a law enforcement function;\n\n(3) To the Office of the Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia;\n\n(3A) To the District of Columbia Retirement Board;\n\n(4) Where an employee is required to possess a security clearance under District law;\n\n(5) To disclosures by District government employees of their credit information to the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability or the Office of the Inspector General, or to the use of such disclosures by those agencies;\n\n(6) To financial institutions, where the position involves access to personal financial information; or\n\n(7) Where an employer requests or receives credit information pursuant to a lawful subpoena, court order, or law enforcement investigation.\n\n(e) For the purposes of this section, the term:\n\n(1) \"Credit information\" means any written, oral, or other communication of information bearing on an employee's creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, or credit history.\n\n(2) \"Financial institution\" shall have the same meaning as provided in § 26-551.02(18).\n\n(3) \"Inquire\" means any direct or indirect conduct intended to gather credit information using any method, including application forms, interviews, and credit history checks.",

      "text": "(a) The Council finds that:\n\n(1) The encouragement of a public acceptance of breastfeeding is consistent with the promotion of family values between a mother and her child and no mother should be made to feel incriminated or socially ostracized for breastfeeding her child.\n\n(2) Breastfeeding a baby constitutes a basic act of nurturing to which every mother and child has a right and which should be encouraged in the interests of maternal and child health.\n\n(3) Breastfeeding provides significant health benefits to both the mother and child. Breastfeeding provides maternal protection from breast cancer, osteoporosis, urinary tract infections, and other cancers. Studies indicate that if every mother in the United States breastfed their children for 2 years, breast cancer could decline by 25%.\n\n(4) Social constraints of modem society weigh against the choice of breastfeeding and often result in new mothers opting to choose formula feeding to avoid embarrassment, social ostracism, or criminal prosecution.\n\n(5) Studies show that babies who are not breastfed have higher rates of death, meningitis, childhood leukemia and other cancers, diabetes, respiratory illnesses, bacterial and viral infections, diarrhoeal diseases, otitis media, allergies, obesity, and developmental delays. Breastfeeding may also raise a baby’s intelligence quotient.\n\n(6) To attain an optimal, healthy start in life, the Surgeon General of the United States and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that babies from birth to at least one year of age be breastfed unless medically contraindicated. In addition, the World Health Organization and UNICEF have established the encouragement of breastfeeding as one of their major goals for the decade.\n\n(7) Despite these recommendations, statistics reveal a declining percentage of mothers are choosing to breastfeed their children. Nearly 50% of all new mothers are now choosing formula over breastfeeding before they leave the hospital, only 20% are still breastfeeding when their babies are 6 months of age, and only 6% are still breastfeeding when their babies are one year of age.\n\n(b) This part has the following purposes:\n\n(1) To increase the incidence and duration of breastfeeding as a goal for optimal maternal and child health and nutrition;\n\n(2) To enable women who so choose to freely breastfeed their children so that infants may be fed exclusively on breast milk from birth to 4 to 6 months of age;\n\n(3) To further enable women to breastfeed while giving appropriate and adequate complementary foods to children for up to 2 years of age or beyond; and\n\n(4) To create an appropriate environment of awareness and support so that women can breastfeed and thereby achieve an ideal child nutrition option.",
