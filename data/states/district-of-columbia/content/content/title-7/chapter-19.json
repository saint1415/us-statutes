In addition, within 24 hours of the Department’s receiving such a report, an APS worker shall commence an investigation to determine the need for protective services. These 2 investigations may be conducted either jointly or separately.\n\n(4) For reports that allege an adult is in need of protective services but do not allege the existence of an immediate, substantial risk of life-threatening harm, an APS worker shall commence an investigation to determine the need for protective services within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) of the Department’s receiving the report.\n\n(5) In accordance with procedures to be established under § 7-1909(1), the Mayor shall ensure that, when appropriate, an APS worker is accompanied by a police officer while conducting an initial or follow-up investigation.\n\n(b) Before entering a residence or otherwise approaching an adult who is allegedly in need of protective services, an APS worker conducting an investigation under this section shall first announce his or her purpose and, if accompanied by a police officer, the presence of that officer, and then secure the consents of the adult allegedly in need of protective services and any other adult who is present and appears to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the residence or immediate premises. If the adult allegedly in need of protective services objects to the investigation and it does not manifestly appear to the APS worker that the objection is prompted by fear or intimidation instilled by another or that the adult is incapacitated, the investigation shall be terminated. If the objection manifestly appears prompted by fear or intimidation instilled by another, or if another person on the premises refuses to allow the investigation to take place, the Department may, either on its own behalf or, if the APS worker is employed by an agency other than the Department, on behalf of the other investigating agency, request the Attorney General to petition for an ex parte order pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. Where good cause exists to believe that a self-neglecting person is incapacitated, the APS worker, the Department, or the Attorney General may provide protective services pursuant to § 7-1905(c-1).\n\n(c) If requested by the Department, the Attorney General shall promptly conduct a factual inquiry and, if legally supportable, file a petition in court for an ex parte order enjoining persons other than the adult who is allegedly in need of protective services from directly or indirectly interfering with the investigation. The petition shall allege specific facts, supported by oath or affirmation, showing that:\n\n(1) There is probable cause to believe an adult located at a specified location is in need of protective services; and\n\n(2) An APS worker conducting an investigation was denied reasonable access to the adult by a 3rd person, or, if the adult objected to the investigation, there is probable cause to believe the objection was prompted by fear or intimidation instilled by another.\n\n(d) If the court finds that a proper showing has been made under subsection (c) (1) and (2) of this section, it shall enjoin the appropriate 3rd person(s) from interfering with an investigation under this section. The court may also order any other relief deemed necessary to facilitate an investigation, but in so doing it shall fully respect the right of an adult who is allegedly in need of protective services to freely object to and terminate that investigation.\n\n(e) The scope of an investigation under this section shall be only that which is minimally necessary for an APS worker to determine whether an adult is in need of protective services, and, if so, what protective services are needed to remedy or substantially reduce the likelihood of abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation by others.",

This 90-day limitation shall begin with the 1st day of services, apply to only those days on which services are actually provided, and include any days on which services are provided under a protection order issued pursuant to § 7-1906 or § 7-1907. The Department’s decision to limit services in a particular case to fewer than 90 days, its determination as to the type or level of services provided, and allegations of noncompliance with this chapter are judicially reviewable only in accordance with § 7-1912(c)(1).\n\n(a-1) Subject to the availability of resources, the Department may provide protective services if:\n\n(1) After an APS worker conducts an investigation under § 7-1904, the Department determines that an adult is in need of protective services due to self-neglect;\n\n(2) The adult in need of protective services, or a person authorized by law or court order to consent to the provision of protective services on behalf of the adult, affirmatively consents to the particular services offered;\n\n(3) Reasonable access is not denied by a third person; and\n\n(4) The adult in need of protective services, if not indigent and exigent circumstances do not dictate otherwise, agrees to reimburse the District or make reasonable contribution pursuant to the rules issued under § 7-1909.\n\n(b) If an adult in need of protective services due to abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation objects to the provision of particular services and it does not manifestly appear to the APS worker that the adult is incapacitated or that the objection is prompted by fear or intimidation instilled by another, the adult shall be entitled to refuse those services and this right of refusal shall be fully respected.\n\n(c) In any case under this section involving abuse, neglect, or exploitation by a third party that does not meet the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Department or other agency designated by the Mayor may provide protective services only after the Attorney General obtains a protection order pursuant to § 7-1906 or § 7-1907.\n\n(c-1) In any case under this section involving self-neglect, if an APS worker has good cause to believe that an adult is incapacitated, the APS worker, the Department, or the Attorney General may:\n\n(1) Petition the court for appointment of a guardianship of the adult or a conservatorship of the estate of the adult (or a limited guardianship or conservatorship) under Chapter 20 of Title 21;\n\n(2) Make referrals or provide information about the adult and the investigation to the appropriate public or private agencies, and monitor the results of any such referrals, as appropriate;\n\n(3) Provide protective services to the extent possible under the circumstances; or\n\n(4) Provide protective services when and if a person authorized by law or court order to consent to the provision of protective services on behalf of the adult, affirmatively consents to the particular services offered.\n\n(d) In accordance with procedures to be established under § 7-1909(1), the Mayor shall ensure that, when appropriate, an APS worker is accompanied by a police officer while providing protective services.\n\n(e) When determining the appropriateness of particular services, the Department or other designated agency shall first consider those protective services that encourage maximum self-determination and are least restrictive of personal liberty.\n\n(f) No provision of subsections (a-1) or (c-1) of this section shall be construed to create an entitlement (either direct or implied) on the part of any individual or family to any services under this chapter for an adult who meets the criteria for self-neglect or who is determined to be at risk due to self-neglect.",

That petition shall state, insofar as the facts can be ascertained with reasonable diligence:\n\n(1) The name, age, physical description, and location of the adult determined by the Department to be in need of protective services;\n\n(2) Whether the adult and any other person(s) expected to be a party to the proceeding are indigent and therefore entitled to the appointment of counsel under subsection (b) of this section;\n\n(3) Facts to substantiate that the adult is in need of protective services;\n\n(4) The particular protective services or other relief sought to remedy or substantially reduce the likelihood of abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation by another; and\n\n(5) Depending on the circumstances, facts to substantiate that:\n\n(A) Failure of the adult in need of protective services to either object or affirmatively consent to those services does not constitute a knowing and voluntary decision to refuse services, but rather is the result of the adult’s inability to consent due to extreme physical or mental impairment or incapacity;\n\n(B) The adult in need of protective services has objected to the provision of those services out of fear or intimidation instilled by another; or\n\n(C) Reasonable access to the adult in need of protective services has been denied by a 3rd person.\n\n(b) Unless continued by the court, a nonjury hearing shall be held on a petition for a provisional protection order within 15 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after it is filed with the court. The Attorney General shall ensure that, at least 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) before the hearing, notice of the hearing date and a copy of the petition are served on the adult in need of protective services and, if applicable and ascertainable with reasonable diligence, the person(s) allegedly responsible for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation, for using fear or intimidation to coerce the adult’s objection to the provision of services, or for denying an APS worker reasonable access to the adult. Notice shall be effected by personal service, substitute service on a person of suitable age and discretion at the usual place of abode or employment of the person to be notified, or registered or certified mail. Pursuant to rules to be established by the court, subpoenas shall issue directing the appearance of persons whose presence at the hearing is essential to the relief sought in the petition. The adult in need of protective services and any other person on whom notice is served under this subsection shall have the right to retain counsel, and if indigent, to have counsel promptly appointed by the court upon the Attorney General’s filing of a petition under subsection (a) of this section. Every effort shall be made to secure the presence of the adult in need of protective services at the hearing; failure of the adult to appear shall be explained by his or her counsel to the satisfaction of the court. All parties to the proceeding may present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Testimony of the person(s) allegedly responsible for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation, and the fruits of that testimony, shall be inadmissible as evidence in a subsequent criminal trial except in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.\n\n(c) The court shall maintain a register of lawyers who have expressed an interest in representing indigent persons entitled to the appointment of counsel under subsection (b) of this section, and shall attempt insofar as possible to make appointments from this register. Publicly funded or pro bono legal services shall be considered and given priority by the court. If such services are unavailable, compensation for appointed counsel shall be at the hourly rate established pursuant to § 11-2604(a), and, unless expressly waived by the court, shall be subject to a maximum amount of $750 per proceeding. Counsel shall also be reimbursed for expenses reasonably incurred. Compensation for investigative, expert, and other services shall be in accordance with § 11-2605. This subsection shall be implemented pursuant to procedures established by the court.\n\n(d) If the court finds that the Attorney General has proven the averments in the petition by a preponderance of the evidence, it may:\n\n(1) Direct any person to refrain from abusing, neglecting, exploiting, directly or indirectly interfering with the provision of services to, residing with, or otherwise contacting the adult in need of protective services;\n\n(2) Direct a caregiver to fulfill his, her, or its legal or contractual responsibilities, or to refrain from inadequately carrying out voluntarily assumed responsibilities;\n\n(3) Direct the Mayor to petition for the appointment of a conservator or guardian;\n\n(4) Direct the Mayor to provide specified or unspecified protective services, including at night and on weekends if necessary; provided, that the court shall not direct the Mayor to provide a type of service not otherwise made available by the District government;\n\n(5) Direct the Mayor, a caregiver, or, when appropriate, another party to the proceeding to remove the adult in need of protective services to a hospital, nursing home, community residence facility, hospice, or other appropriate facility (except a facility or part of a facility that has as its principal purpose the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses and disorders), so long as the placement is the least restrictive setting available in which the adult’s needs can be adequately met;\n\n(6) Direct any person to pay or reimburse the District, in accordance with § 7-1910, for relief granted under paragraph (4) or (5) of this subsection; or\n\n(7) Direct any combination of the above.\n\n(e) When granting relief under subsection (d)(3) through (5) of this section, the court shall first consider those remedies that encourage maximum self-determination and are least restrictive of personal liberty. In so doing, the court shall adopt a strong, rebuttable presumption in favor of home care over institutionalization. Secondarily, the court shall inquire about and take into consideration potential expense to the District.\n\n(f) The court may modify or rescind a provisional protection order upon the motion of any party to the original proceeding and for good cause shown. Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, a provisional protection order granting the relief in subsection (d)(4) or (5) of this section shall remain effective as to that relief for such period up to 45 calendar days as the court may specify, except that on the motion of any party to the original proceeding and for good cause shown, the court may grant a single extension for a period not to exceed an additional 45 calendar days. This 90-day time limitation may not be circumvented by the attempted issuance of a new order or reissuance of the original order before or after the extension period has expired. Relief granted under subsection (d)(1) through (3) and (6) of this section shall remain effective for such period as the court may specify.\n\n(g) When determining the duration of a provisional protection order that directs the Mayor to provide protective services, the court shall take into account the number of days, if any, that the District has already provided services pursuant to § 7-1905(a) or § 7-1907, and in no event shall the issuance of a protection order result in the District’s being required to provide more than 90 days of services in any particular case.",

No adult in need of protective services shall be denied those services because he or she is unable to pay for them or because a person (other than the adult) who is legally responsible for providing any or all of the services refuses to reimburse the District or contribute to their cost. The Attorney General may, either as part of a proceeding for a protection order or in an independent court action, seek an order directing the adult in need of protective services or person(s) legally responsible for those services to pay or reimburse the District for so much of the cost of providing protective services under this chapter as he or she is reasonably able to afford. The court, however, may not direct an adult in need of protective services to pay or reimburse the District for any of the cost of providing those services if the court orders the services over the continued objection of the adult after finding that the objection has been prompted by fear or intimidation instilled by another.\n\n(b) The Attorney General may, either as part of a proceeding for a protection order or in an independent court action, seek an order directing the person(s) responsible for an adult’s abuse, neglect, or exploitation to pay or reimburse the District for all or part of the costs associated with conducting the investigation, appointing counsel, and providing protective services in that particular case. In so doing, the Attorney General shall have the burden of proving a person’s responsibility for abuse, neglect, or exploitation by a preponderance of the evidence. Testimony of the defendant(s), and the fruits of that testimony, shall be inadmissible as evidence in a subsequent criminal trial except in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.",
