This Council will enlist the views of a diverse group of business, labor, community, education and government leaders to develop a strategic plan for workforce development in the District of Columbia.\n\n(6) The strategic plan should provide for the development of a comprehensive, consumer-driven employment and career development system that meets the needs of all members of the workforce, including those entering the workforce for the first time, those in transition to employment and those currently employed who seek to enhance their skills for continued career advancement.",
