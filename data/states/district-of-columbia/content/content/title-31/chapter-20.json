In such event, the failure of the foreign insurer to file an RBC Plan with the Commissioner shall be grounds to order the insurer to cease and desist from writing new insurance business in the District.\n\n(d) In the event of a Mandatory Control Level Event with respect to any foreign insurer, if no domiciliary receiver has been appointed with respect to the foreign insurer under the rehabilitation and liquidation statute applicable in the state of domicile of the foreign insurer, the Commissioner may make application to the Superior Court permitted under Chapter 13 of this title with respect to the liquidation of property of foreign insurers found in the District, and the occurrence of the Mandatory Control Level Event shall be considered adequate grounds for the application.",
