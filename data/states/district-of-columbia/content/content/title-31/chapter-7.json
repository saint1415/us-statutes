In calculating the amount of these investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries shall be excluded, and there shall be included:\n\n(A) Total net monies or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities; and\n\n(B) All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus, of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation;\n\n(2) Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of 1 or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer, provided, that each subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that the investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in or in paragraph (1) of this subsection or in § 31-2502.18 [repealed], or in §§ 31-4435 [repealed] and 31-4442, applicable to the insurer.

If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control as defined in § 31-701(2), it is not solely for investment purposes unless the Commissioner of Insurance or other appropriate official of the insurer’s state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary Commissioner to the Mayor;\n\n(C) The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if preacquisition notification is filed with the Mayor in accordance with subsection (c)(1) of this section 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition.

The acquired person may file a preacquisition notification. The Mayor shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under this subsection in the same manner as provided in § 31-708.\n\n(2) The preacquisition notification shall be in the form and contain the information prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners relating to those markets which, under subsection (b)(2)(E) of this section, cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this section.

The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in the District accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indicating his or her ability to render an informed opinion.\n\n(3) The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt by the Mayor of a preacquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the 30th day after the date of the receipt or termination of the waiting period by the Mayor. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the Mayor, on a one-time basis, may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the 30th day after receipt of the additional information by the Mayor or termination of the waiting period by the Mayor.\n\n(1) The Mayor may enter an order under subsection (e)(1) of this section with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be to lessen substantially competition in any line of insurance in the District, or tend to create a monopoly therein, or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(2) In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Mayor shall consider the following:\n\n(A) Any acquisition covered under subsection (b) of this section involving 2 or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards if the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:\n\n(B) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the 2 largest to the 8 largest, has increased by 7% or more of the market over a period of time extending from any base year 5 to 10 years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. Any acquisition or merger covered under subsection (b) of this section involving 2 or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in paragraph (1) of this subsection if:\n\n(i) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;\n\n(ii) One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share; and\n\n(iii) Another involved insurer’s market is 2% or more.\n\n(C) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term:\n\n(i) “Insurer” includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership, or control.\n\n(ii) “Market” means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the Mayor shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, the line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in the District, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be the District.\n\n(D) The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the Mayor.\n\n(E) Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the Mayor may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, the following: market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market.\n\n(3) An order may not be entered under subsection (e)(1) through (4) of this section if:\n\n(A) The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that feasibly cannot be achieved in any other way, and the public benefits which would arise from these economies exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition; or\n\n(B) The acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of this increase exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition.\n\n(1) If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the Mayor may enter an order:\n\n(A) Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in the District with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation; or\n\n(B) Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in the District.\n\n(2) An order under this subsection shall not be entered unless:\n\n(A) There is a hearing;\n\n(B) Notice of the hearing is issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than 15 days prior to the hearing; and\n\n(C) The hearing is concluded and the order is issued no later than 60 days after the end of the waiting period. Every order shall be accompanied by a written decision of the Mayor setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(3) An order entered under this subsection shall not become final earlier than 30 days after it is issued, during which time the involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy the anticompetitive impact of the acquisition within a reasonable time. Based upon such a plan or other information, the Mayor shall specify the conditions, if any, under the time period during which the aspects of the acquisition causing a violation of the standards of this section would be remedied and the order vacated or modified.\n\n(4) An order pursuant to this subsection shall not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.\n\n(5) Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the Mayor under paragraph (1) of this subsection while such an order is in effect may, after notice and hearing and upon order of the Mayor, be subject, at the discretion of the Mayor, to any one or more of the following:\n\n(A) A monetary administrative penalty of not more than $10,000 for every day of violation; or\n\n(B) Suspension or revocation of the person’s license.\n\n(6) Any insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section, and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with any filing requirement, shall be subject to an administrative fine of not more than $50,000.\n\n(f) Sections 31-709(b) and (c) and 31-711 do not apply to acquisitions covered under subsection (b) of this section.",

An insurer required to file financial statements pursuant to this paragraph may satisfy the request by providing the Mayor with the most recently filed parent corporation financial statements that have been filed with the SEC;\n\n(5) Other matters concerning transactions between registered insurers and any affiliates as may be included from time to time in any registration forms adopted or approved by the Mayor;\n\n(6) Statements that the insurer’s board of directors oversees corporate governance and internal controls and that the insurer’s officers or senior management have approved, implemented, and continue to maintain and monitor corporate governance and internal control procedures; and\n\n(7) Any other information required by the Mayor by rule or regulation.\n\n(c) All registration statements shall contain a summary outlining all items in the current registration statement which are different from the prior registration statement.\n\n(d) No information need be disclosed on the registration statement filed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section if the information is not material for the purposes of this section. Unless the Mayor by rule, regulation, or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments, or guarantees involving one-half of 1% or less of an insurer’s admitted assets as of the 31st day of December next preceding shall not be deemed material for purposes of this section.\n\n(e) Subject to § 31-706(b), each registered insurer shall report to the Mayor all dividends and other distributions to shareholders within 15 business days following their declaration.\n\n(f) Any person within an insurance holding company system subject to registration shall be required to provide complete and accurate information to an insurer, where the information is reasonably necessary to enable the insurer to comply with the provisions of this subchapter.\n\n(g) The Mayor shall terminate the registration of any insurer which demonstrates that it no longer is a member of an insurance holding company system.\n\n(h) The Mayor may require or allow 2 or more affiliated insurers subject to registration to file a consolidated registration statement.\n\n(i) The Mayor may allow an insurer which is authorized to do business in the District and which is part of an insurance holding company system to register on behalf of any affiliated insurer which is required to register under subsection (a) of this section and to file all information and material required to be filed under this section.\n\n(j) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any insurer, information, or transaction if and to the extent that the Mayor by rule, regulation, or order shall exempt the same from the provisions of this section.\n\n(k) Any person may file with the Mayor a disclaimer of affiliation with any authorized insurer or the disclaimer may be filed by the insurer or any member of an insurance holding company system.

The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the Mayor or has been deemed approved.\n\n(k-1) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report. The report shall, to the best of the ultimate controlling person’s knowledge and belief, identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\n(l) The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by this section within the time specified for such a filing shall be a violation of this section.",

The notice for amendments or modifications shall include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer. Informal notice shall be reported to the Mayor within 30 days after termination of a previously filed agreement for determination of the type of filing required, if any:\n\n(A) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, or extensions of credit, guarantees, or investments provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:\n\n(i) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer’s admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31st next preceding; or\n\n(ii) With respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer’s admitted assets as of December 31st next preceding;\n\n(B) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes the loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit, provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:\n\n(i) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer’s admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31st next preceding; or\n\n(ii) With respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer’s admitted assets as of December 31st next preceding;\n\n(C) Reinsurance agreements or modifications, including:\n\n(i) All reinsurance pooling agreements; and\n\n(ii) Agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer’s liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer’s liabilities in any of the next 3 years, equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders, as of the 31st day of December next preceding, including those agreements that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a non-affiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and non-affiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer;\n\n(D) All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements, guarantees, and all cost-sharing arrangements; and\n\n(E) Any material transactions, specified by regulation, which the Mayor determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer’s policyholders.\n\n(3) Nothing contained in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.\n\n(4) A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the Mayor determines that any separate transactions were entered into over any 12-month period for that purpose, the Mayor may exercise authority provided under § 31-710.\n\n(5) The Mayor, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.\n\n(6) The Mayor shall be notified within 30 days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds 10% of such corporation’s voting securities.\n\n(1) No domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until:\n\n(A) Thirty days after the Mayor has received notice of the declaration and has not within this period disapproved the payment; or\n\n(B) The Mayor shall have approved the payment within the 30-day period.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of 10% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding, or the net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending the 31st day of December next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer’s own securities. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous 2 calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the Mayor’s approval, and such a declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until the Mayor has approved the payment of such a dividend or distribution, or the Mayor has not disapproved the payment within the 30-day period referred to above.\n\n(1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate operating identity consistent with this subchapter.\n\n(2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property, or services with 1 or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subsection (a)(1) of this section.\n\n(3) Not less than 1/3 of the directors of a domestic insurer and not less than 1/3 of the members of each committee of the board of directors of any domestic insurer shall be persons who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or such an entity. At least 1 such person must be included in any quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors or any committee.\n\n(4) The board of directors of a domestic insurer shall establish 1 or more committees comprised solely of directors who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer, and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or any such entity. The committee or committees shall have responsibilities of nominating candidates for director for election by shareholders or policyholders, evaluating the performance of officers deemed to be principal officers of the insurer, and recommending to the board of directors the selection and compensation of the principal officers.\n\n(5) The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection shall not apply to a domestic insurer if the person controlling the insurer is an insurer, a mutual insurance holding company, or a publicly held corporation that has a board of directors and committees that meet the requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection.\n\n(6) An insurer may make application to the Mayor for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection, if the insurer’s annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and Federal Flood Program, is less than $300 million. An insurer may also make application to the Commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection based upon unique circumstances. The Mayor may consider various factors, including the type of business entity, volume of business written, availability of qualified board members, and the ownership or organizational structure of the entity.\n\n(d) For purposes of this subchapter, in determining whether an insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:\n\n(1) The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;\n\n(2) The extent to which the insurer’s business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;\n\n(3) The number and size of risks insured in each line of business;\n\n(4) The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer’s insured risks;\n\n(5) The nature and extent of the insurer’s reinsurance program;\n\n(6) The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer’s investment portfolio;\n\n(7) The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer’s investment portfolio;\n\n(8) The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;\n\n(9) The adequacy of the insurer’s reserves; and\n\n(10) The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The Mayor may treat such an investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in his or her judgment such an investment so warrants.",
