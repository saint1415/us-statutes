      "text": "(A) The Commissioner shall annually value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities (hereinafter called reserves) for all outstanding life insurance policies and annuity and pure endowment contracts of every life insurance company doing business in the District issued prior to the operative date of the valuation model, except that in the case of an alien company such valuation shall be limited to its insurance transactions in the United States. All such valuations made by him or by his authority shall be made upon the net premium basis. In calculating such reserves, he may use group methods and approximate averages for fractions of a year or otherwise. In lieu of the valuation of the reserves herein required of any foreign or alien company, he may accept any valuation made, or caused to be made, by the insurance supervisory official of any state or other jurisdiction when such valuation complies with the minimum standard provided in this section.\n\n(B) The provisions set forth in subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section and § 31-4720 shall apply to all policies and contracts, as appropriate, subject to this section, issued on or after the operative date of § 31-4705.02 and before the operative date of the valuation model. The provisions set forth in subsections (g) and (h) of this section shall not apply to any such policies and contracts.\n\n(C) The minimum standard for the valuation of policies and contracts issued before the operative date of § 31-4705.02 shall be provided in subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(A) The Commissioner shall annually value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities (\"reserves\") for all outstanding life insurance contracts, annuity and pure endowment contracts, accident and health contracts, and deposit-type contracts of every company issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual.\n\n(B) The provisions set forth in subsections (f), (g), and (h) of this section shall apply to all policies and contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual.\n\n(2) Any such company which at any time shall have adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to a minimum standard herein provided may, with the approval of the Commissioner, adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum herein provided.\n\n(1) This subsection shall apply to only those policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date of § 31-4705.02 (the standard nonforfeiture law).\n\n(2) The legal minimum standard for the valuation of life insurance contracts issued before January 1, 1935, shall be the method and basis of valuation heretofore applied by the Commissioner in the valuation of such contracts, and for life insurance contracts issued on and after said date shall be the 1-year preliminary term method of valuation, except as hereinafter modified, on the basis of the American Experience Table of Mortality with interest at 3 1/2% per annum; provided, that any life company may, at its option, value its insurance contracts issued on and after January 1, 1935, in accordance with their terms on the basis of the American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality with interest not higher than 3 1/2% per annum by the level net premium method or by the modified preliminary term method hereinafter described.\n\n(3) If the premium charged for term insurance under a limited payment life preliminary term policy providing for the payment of all premiums thereon in less than 20 years from date of the policy, or under an endowment preliminary term policy, exceeds that charged for like insurance under 20-payment life preliminary term policies of the same company, the reserve thereon at the end of the year, including the 1st, shall not be less than the reserve on a 20-payment life preliminary term policy issued in the same year and at the same age, together with an amount which shall be equivalent to the accumulation of a net level premium sufficient to provide for a pure endowment at the end of the premium payment period, equal to the difference between the value at the end of such period of such a 20-payment life preliminary term policy and the full net level premium reserve at such time of such a limited payment life or endowment policy. The premium payment period is the period during which premiums are concurrently payable under such 20-payment life preliminary term policy and such limited payment life or endowment policy.\n\n(4) Policies issued on the preliminary term method shall contain a clause specifying that the reserve thereof shall be computed in accordance with modified preliminary term method of valuation provided for herein.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of this section for group annuity and pure endowment contracts, the legal minimum standard for the valuation of annuities issued on and after January 1, 1935, shall be McClintock’s Table of Mortality Among Annuitants, with interest at 4% per annum, but annuities deferred 10 or more years and written in connection with life insurance shall be valued on the same basis as that used in computing the consideration or premium therefor, or upon any higher standard at the option of the company.\n\n(6) The legal minimum standard for the valuation of industrial policies issued after January 1, 1935, shall be the American Experience Table of Mortality with interest at 3 1/2% per annum; provided, that any life company may voluntarily value its industrial policies on the basis of the standard industrial mortality table or the substandard industrial mortality table by the level net premium method or in accordance with their terms by the modified preliminary term method hereinbefore described.\n\n(7) The Commissioner may vary the standards of interest and mortality in the case of alien companies as to contracts issued by such companies in countries other than the United States, and in particular cases of invalid lives and other extra hazards.\n\n(8) Reserves for all such policies and contracts may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by this subsection.\n\n(1) This subsection shall apply to only those policies and contracts issued on or after the operative date of § 31-4705.02 (the standard nonforfeiture law) except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection for group annuity and pure endowment contracts issued prior to such operative date.\n\n(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection and subsections (d) and (f) of this section, the minimum standard for the valuation of all such policies and contracts shall be the Commissioner's reserve valuation methods defined in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection and in § 31-4720, 3 1/2% interest per annum, or in the case of policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, issued on or after the October 13, 1978, 4 1/2% interest per annum, and the following tables:\n\n(A) For ordinary policies of life insurance issued on the standard basis, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such policies, the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table for such policies issued prior to the operative date of paragraph (5) of § 31-4705.02(d), and the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table for category of the policies issued on or after the operative date of the 5th paragraph in § 31-4705.02(d) and before the operative date for the category of policies described in § 31-4705.02(e);

If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this paragraph for such company shall be January 1, 1979.\n\n(A) Except as provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection and in § 31-4720, and according to the reserve valuation method, reserves for life insurance and endowment benefits from policies providing uniform amounts of insurance and requiring uniform premium payments shall be the excess of the present value, on the valuation date, of the future guaranteed benefits from the policies over the then present value of any future modified net premiums.\n\n(B) The modified net premiums shall be a uniform percentage of the respective premiums that makes the present value, on the issuance date, of all modified net premiums equal the sum of the then present value of the benefits and the excess of the amount described in sub-subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph over the amount described in sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph.\n\n(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, a net level annual premium equal to the present value, on issuance date, of the benefits provided after the first policy year, divided by the present value, on issuance date, of an annuity of one per year to be paid on every anniversary of the policy for which a premium becomes due.\n\n(ii) A net 1-year term premium for the benefits provided in the first policy year.\n\n(C) The net level annual premium described in subparagraph (B)(i) of this paragraph shall not exceed the net level annual premium or the 19-year premium whole life plan for insuring the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issuance in the policy.\n\n(A) This paragraph governs life insurance policies issued after December 31, 1986, when the policies have the following features:\n\n(i) The premium for the first year of the life insurance policy exceeds the premium for the second year.\n\n(ii) The policy does not provide an additional benefit in the first year of the policy for the amount that the 1st-year premium exceeds the premium for the second year.\n\n(iii) The policy provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value that exceeds the difference in the first year and the second year premiums.\n\n(B) Except as provided in § 31-4702, and according to the reserve valuation method on any policy anniversary that takes place no later than the 1st year after a life insurance policy provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value that, together, exceeds the difference in the premiums described in subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph, the reserve shall be the greater of the following amounts:\n\n(i) The reserve on the policy anniversary as described in paragraph (4) of this subsection.\n\n(ii) The reserve on the policy anniversary as described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, but with the amount described in paragraph (4)(B)(i) of this subsection reduced by 15% of the excess first year premium, with present values of benefits and premiums determined without reference to premiums or benefits after the first year after a life insurance policy provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value that, together, exceeds the difference in the premiums described in subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph, with an assumption that the policy will mature as an endowment on that date; and with the cash surrender value provided on that date regarded as an endowment benefit.\n\n(C) For the comparison described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the mortality and interest bases described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection and in subsection (d)(2) and (3) of this section shall apply.\n\n(A) This paragraph shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts except those group annuity and pure endowment contracts for which reserves are to be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of paragraph (4) of this subsection.\n\n(B) Reserves according to the Commissioner's annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in such contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by such contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation consideration derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of such contract, that become payable prior to the end of such respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of such contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.\n\n(6) In no event shall a company’s aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated according to the method described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, in subsection (e) of this section, in § 31-4720, and in the mortality tables and rates of interest used to calculate nonforfeiture benefits for the policies.\n\n(7) Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits, as established by the Commissioner, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard herein provided, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided in the policies or contracts.\n\n(1) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates shall be the interest rates used to determine the minimum standard for valuing the following:\n\n(A) Life insurance benefits under § 31-4705.02 and issued no earlier than the operative date for policies under § 31-4705.02(e).\n\n(B) Annuities and pure endowments purchased under group annuity and pure endowments contracts after December 31, 1983.\n\n(C) Except as provided in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, all life insurance benefits, individual annuity contracts, and pure endowment contracts issued after December 31, 1983.\n\n(D) In a calendar year following December 31, 1983, the net increase of amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts.\n\n(2) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates shall be determined according to the equations described in this paragraph, and the results from the equations shall be rounded to the nearest 1/4%.\n\n(A) For life insurance, the equation for determining the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates is the following:\n\n(B) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options,\n\n(C) Where cash settlement options are valued on an issue year basis, the formula in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration exceeding 10 years and the formula in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of 10 years or less.\n\n(D) Where no cash settlement options apply, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply.\n\n(E) Where cash settlement options are valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply.\n\n(i) If the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies for a calendar year differs from the actual interest rate for similar policies issued in the preceding calendar year by less than 1⁄2%, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate shall equal the corresponding actual interest rate for the preceding calendar year.\n\n(ii) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year regardless of when § 31-4705.02(e) becomes operative.\n\n(3) The weighting factors in the paragraph (2)(A) and (B) of this subsection equations are as follows:\n\n(A) Weighting factors for life insurance:\n\n(B) Weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: .80.\n\n(C) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts shall be specified in the following sub-subparagraphs:\n\n(i) For purposes of this subsection, the following plan types apply:\n\n(ii) Weighting factors for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis:\n\n(iii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors shown in sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph increased by:\n\n(iv) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis (other than those with no cash settlement options) and which do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase, and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis and which do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than 12 months beyond the valuation date, the factors shown in sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph or derived in sub-subparagraph (iii) of this subparagraph increased by:\n\n(v) Where cash settlement options apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts, the guarantee duration is the number of years that the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years.\n\n(vi) Where no cash settlement options apply to annuities or guaranteed interest contracts, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the issuance or the purchase date that the policy has scheduled the annuity benefits to begin.\n\n(i) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis.\n\n(ii) Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis.\n\n(iii) An issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis where the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the annuity or the guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the issuance year or purchase year.\n\n(iv) The change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis where the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for each change in the annuity or the guaranteed interest contract fund is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year that the fund changed.\n\n(4) The reference interest rate referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be as follows:\n\n(A) For all life insurance, the reference rate shall be the lesser between the average rate during a 36-month period and the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year preceding the issuance year.\n\n(B) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising where cash settlement options apply to other annuities and to guaranteed interest contracts, the reference rate shall be the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase.\n\n(C) Where guarantee duration exceeds 10 years and where cash settlement options for annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts have values based upon the issuance year, the reference rate shall be the least between the average rate during a 36-month period and the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase.\n\n(D) Where guarantee duration does not exceed 10 years and where cash settlement options for annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts have values based upon the issuance year, the reference rate shall be the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase.\n\n(E) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the reference rate shall be the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase.\n\n(F) Where cash settlement options apply to annuities and to guaranteed interest contracts and have values based on a change in the fund, the reference rate shall be the average rate during a 12-month period ending June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund.\n\n(5) The reference interest rate referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be as follows:\n\n(A) Moody’s Corporate Bond Yield Average—Monthly Average Corporate published by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., shall set the reference rates described in paragraph (4) of this subsection.\n\n(B) If the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., is no longer an appropriate source for the reference rate, then an alternative method shall be adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by the Commissioner.\n\n(e) For life insurance plans which require the company to fix future premium determination according to the then present estimates of future experience, and for life insurance plans or annuities with minimum reserves that cannot be determined by the methods described in subsection (c)(5) and (6) of this section and in § 31-4720, the reserves held under the plan shall:\n\n(1) Be appropriated in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for the plan.\n\n(2) Be computed by a method consistent with the principles of the Standard Valuation Law and according to regulations promulgated by the Commissioner.\n\n(f) For disability and accident and sickness health insurance policies and contracts as provided under § 31-4712 and accident and long-time care health insurance policies and contracts as provided under Chapter 36 of this title, issued on or after the operative date of § 31-4705.02 and

In cases where applicable a company may also include a requirement of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the company.\n\n(c) No contract for a reversionary annuity shall be so issued or delivered unless it contains in substance the following provisions:\n\n(1) Paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (5) of subsection (b) of this section, except that under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section, the company may, at its option, provide for an equitable reduction of the amount of the annuity payments in settlement of any overdue or deferred payments, in lieu of providing for a deduction of such payments from any amount payable upon a settlement under the contract;\n\n(2) A provision that, if the age of any of the persons upon whose lives the contract is based has been misstated, the amount payable under the contract shall be such as the stipulated payments to the company would have purchased at the correct ages; and\n\n(3) A provision that the contract may be reinstated at any time within 3 years from the date of default in making stipulated payments to the company, upon production of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the company, provided that all overdue payments and any indebtedness to the company on the contract shall be made or paid, with interest thereon at a rate to be specified in the contract, but not exceeding 6 per centum per annum, payable annually.\n\n(d) Any of the foregoing provisions or portions thereof not applicable to nonparticipating contracts nor to contracts for which a single stipulated payment to the company is made shall, to that extent, not be incorporated therein; and any such contract may be issued or delivered in this District, which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, contains provisions on any 1 or more of the several foregoing requirements, more favorable to the holder of the contract than hereinbefore required.\n\n(e) Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent a life company, which issues life insurance on a participating basis, from issuing annuities, reversionary annuities, or pure endowments on a nonparticipating basis.\n\n(f) Any such contract or any application, endorsement, or rider form used in connection therewith, issued in violation of this section, shall, nevertheless, be held valid, but shall be construed as provided in this section and when any provision in such contract, application, endorsement, or rider is in conflict with any provision of this section or with any other statutory provision, the rights, duties, and obligations of the company, of the holder of the contract and of the beneficiary or annuitant thereunder shall be governed by the provisions of this section.\n\n(g) The provisions of this section shall not apply to contracts of reinsurance nor to contracts for deferred annuities or reversionary annuities included in life insurance policies.\n\n(h) For the purposes of this section, application forms, rider forms, and endorsement forms for use in connection with any such contract, excepting riders or endorsements relating to the manner of distribution of benefits or to the reservation of rights and benefits under any such contract, and used at the request of the individual holders of such contracts, shall be deemed to be parts of such contract and shall require the approval of the Commissioner. No rider and no endorsement, except as stated above, shall be attached to or printed or stamped upon any such contract issued or delivered in the District until the form of such rider or endorsement has been filed with the Commissioner and formally approved by him.",

This section shall not apply to term insurance of 20 years or less. The net single premium rate employed in computing the term of temporary insurance or the amount of pure endowment insurance granted as a nonforfeiture value under any life insurance policy may at the option of the company be based upon a table of mortality showing rates of mortality not greater than 130 per centum of those shown by the American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality instead of the table used in computing the reserve on the policy, or in case of substandard policies not greater than 130 per centum of the rates of mortality shown by the table of mortality approved by the Commissioner for computing the reserve on the policy, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.",

      "text": "(1) Except as provided in subsections (i) and (j) of this section and for policies issued after the operative date of this section, no life insurance policy shall be issued or delivered in the District of Columbia unless it contains the following provisions or corresponding provisions which the Commissioner considers at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as the following provisions;\n\n(i) If the insured defaults on a premium payment after premiums have been paid 1 full year for ordinary insurance or 3 full years for industrial insurance, the company shall grant, upon proper request no later than 60 days after the premium became due, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall be effective when the premiums became due.\n\n(ii) The company may substitute for the nonforfeiture benefit described in subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph an actuarially equal alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.\n\n(B) If the insured defaults on a premium payment after ordinary insurance premiums have been paid for 3 full years or industrial insurance premiums have been paid for 5 full years and surrenders the policy within 60 days after the premiums became due, the company shall pay a cash surrender value instead of paying a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit.\n\n(C) A specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective unless the person entitled to make an election chooses another available option no later than 60 days after the defaulted premium became due.\n\n(D) If all premium payments become paid or if the company continues the policy under a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective after the eve of the 3rd policy anniversary for ordinary insurance or after the eve of the 5th policy anniversary for industrial insurance, and if the insured surrenders the policy within 30 days after any policy anniversary, the company will pay a cash surrender value.\n\n(i) For policies creating upon the guaranteed bases unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums or having an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the policy shall describe or show the mortality table, the interest rate, and the method used to calculate cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy.\n\n(ii) For all other policies, the policy shall show the mortality table and the interest rate used to calculate the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on each anniversary either during the first 20 policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, and with the values and benefits calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the company on the policy.\n\n(i) The policy shall provide a brief and general statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available on any policy anniversary after the last anniversary treated in the policy according to the manner described in subparagraph (E)(ii) of this paragraph.\n\n(ii) The brief statement shall explain how paid-up additions and indebtedness on the policy changes the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\n(2) Any subsection (a) provision that does not apply to the plan of insurance in a policy may be omitted from the policy to the extent that the provision does not apply.\n\n(3) The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value until 6 months after payment has been demanded and until the insured has surrendered the policy.\n\n(1) Any cash surrender value available under subsection (a) of this section after a default on a premium due on a policy anniversary shall be at least the excess of the present value, on the anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided by the policy and any existing paid-up additions, had there been no default, over the sum of the following:\n\n(A) The then present value of the adjusted premiums described in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, corresponding to premiums which would have become due after the eve of the anniversary.\n\n(B) The amount of any indebtedness to the company on the policy.\n\n(2) For any policy issued after the operative date of subsection (e) of this section and which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an additional premium by rider or by supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be at least the sum of the cash surrender value for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the rider or the supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by the rider or the supplemental provision.\n\n(3) For any family policy issued after the operative date of subsection (e) of this section and which defines a “primary insured” and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured for a period that shall expire before the spouse becomes 71, the cash surrender value referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be at least the sum of the cash surrender for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by the term insurance on the life of the spouse.\n\n(4) Any cash surrender value available within 30 days after any policy anniversary on a policy paid up by completion of all premium payments or a policy continued under a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall be at least the present value, on the anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided by the policy and any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the company on the policy.\n\n(c) Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under a policy referred to in subsection (a) of this section after a default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary shall be in a sufficient amount for the present value on the anniversary to be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided by the policy or, if none is provided, the cash surrender value that would have been required by this section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall be paid for at least a specified period.\n\n(1) This subsection shall not apply to policies issued after the operative date of subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (8) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be a uniform percentage of the premiums for each policy year, excluding any extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards, and the adjusted premiums shall equal the sum of:\n\n(A) The value, on the issuance date, of the future guaranteed benefits provided by the policy.\n\n(B) Two per centum of the amount of insurance for uniform amounts of insurance or an equal amount for amounts of insurance that vary with the duration of the policy.\n\n(C) Forty per centum of the adjusted premium for the 1st policy year.\n\n(D) Twenty-five per centum of either the adjusted premium for the 1st policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same or equal uniform amount, with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less.\n\n(3) For the percentages described in paragraph (2)(C) and (D) of this subsection, no adjusted premium shall exceed 4% of the amount of insurance.\n\n(A) For a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with the duration of the policy, the equal uniform amount shall be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy that contained the same endowment benefits issued at the same age for the same term, with the benefits not varying with the duration of the policy and with the benefits valued the same on the date of issue as the benefits under the policy.\n\n(B) For a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age 10, the equal uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy before the child became 10 was the amount of insurance provided at age 10.\n\n(A) The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall equal the sum of the following:\n\n(i) The adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance benefits.\n\n(ii) For the period when premiums for the term insurance benefits become payable, the adjusted premiums for the term insurance.\n\n(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the equation in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be calculated separately and according to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection.\n\n(C) For paragraph (2)(B), (C), and (D) of this subsection, the amount of insurance or equal uniform amount of insurance used to calculate the adjusted premiums referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph shall equal the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used to calculate the adjusted premiums described in subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph.\n\n(A) Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, paragraph (5)(B) and (C) of this subsection, and paragraph (8) of this subsection, all adjusted premiums and present values for ordinary insurance policies shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table.\n\n(B) For ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age no more than 3 years younger than the actual age of the insured, and the calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table.\n\n(i) All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding 3 1/2% per year, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\n(ii) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed shall not exceed 130% of the rates of mortality according to the applicable table.\n\n(iii) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on another mortality table specified by the company and approved by the Commissioner.\n\n(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of this paragraph and paragraph (8) of this subsection and for ordinary policies issued after the operative date of this paragraph, the adjusted premiums and present values shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the interest rate for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits shall be specified in the policy.\n\n(ii) Except as provided in sub-subparagraph (iii) of this subparagraph, the interest rate shall not exceed 3 1/2% per year.\n\n(iii) An interest not exceeding 5 1/2% per year may be used for policies issued after October 12, 1978.\n\n(B) For ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age no more than 6 years younger than the actual age of the insured.\n\n(C) In calculating the present value of a paid-up term insurance with pure endowment offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be no more than the rates in the Commissioners 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\n(D) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of adjusted premiums and present values may be based on another mortality table specified by the company and approved by the Commissioner.\n\n(i) After June 27, 1960, a company may file with the Commissioner a written notice of the company’s election to comply with this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1966.\n\n(ii) After filing the notice, then, on the specified date, this paragraph shall become operative for ordinary policies issued by the company.\n\n(iii) If a company makes no election, then the operative date of the paragraph for the company shall be January 1, 1966.\n\n(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of this paragraph and for industrial policies issued after the operative date of this paragraph, adjusted premiums and present values shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the interest rate for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits shall be specified in the policy.\n\n(ii) Except as provided in subparagraph (A)(iii) of this paragraph, the interest rate shall not exceed 3 1/2% per year.\n\n(iii) An interest rate not exceeding 5 1/2% per year may be used for policies issued after October 12, 1978.\n\n(B) For individual insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age no more than 6 years younger than the actual age of the insured.\n\n(C) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with pure endowment offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed shall be no more than the rates in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\n(D) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of adjusted premiums and present values may be based on another mortality table specified by the company and approved by the Commissioner.\n\n(i) After October 3, 1962, a company may file with the Commissioner a written notice of the company’s election to comply with this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1968.\n\n(ii) After filing the notice, then, on the specified date, this paragraph shall become operative for the industrial policies issued by the company.\n\n(iii) If a company makes no election, the operative date of this paragraph for the company shall be January 1, 1968.\n\n(1) This subsection shall apply to all policies issued after the operative date of this subsection.\n\n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (7) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for a policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be the uniform percentage of the policy premiums for each policy year.\n\n(3) The adjusted premium shall exclude amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and shall also exclude a uniform annual contract change or policy fee described in the policy statement of the method used to calculate the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\n(4) The present value, on the issuance date, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of the following:\n\n(A) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.\n\n(B) One per centum of either the amount of insurance for uniform amounts of insurance or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years.\n\n(C) One hundred twenty-five per centum of the nonforfeiture net level premium.\n\n(5) For the percentage described in paragraph (4)(C) of this subsection, no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be considered in excess of 4% of either the amount of insurance for uniform amounts of insurance or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years.\n\n(6) The policy shall issue when the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\n(7) The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the issuance date of the guaranteed benefits provided by the policy divided by the present value, on the issuance date, of an annuity of 1 per year payable when the policy issues and on each anniversary when a premium becomes due.\n\n(8) For policies which create in a guaranteed basis unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present value shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from benefits and premiums established when the policy issues.\n\n(9) When the benefits or premiums change, the future adjusted premiums, the nonforfeiture net level, and the present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from the benefits and premiums established by the change.\n\n(10) Except as provided by paragraph (15) of this subsection, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for the policy shall be the uniform percentage of the future premiums for each policy.\n\n(11) The recalculated future premiums shall exclude amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards and shall also exclude a uniform annual contract charge or policy fee described on the policy in a statement of the method used to calculate the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\n(12) At the time of the change to new benefits or premiums, the present value of all the future adjusted premiums shall equal the excess of the sum described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph over the amount described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.\n\n(A) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided by the policy and the additional expense allowance.\n\n(B) The then cash surrender value or present value of paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.\n\n(13) At the time of the change to the new benefits or premiums, the additional expense allowance shall be the sum of the following:\n\n(A) One per centum of the difference, if positive, between the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years after the change and the average amount of insurance before the change at the beginning of each of the first 10 years after the most recent previous change or, if there has been no previous change, the issuance date.\n\n(B) One hundred twenty-five per centum of the increase in the nonforfeiture net level premium.\n\n(14) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall equal the result obtained by dividing the equation described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph with the amount described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.\n\n(A) This amount equals the sum of the following:\n\n(i) The nonforfeiture net level premium before the change multiplied by the present value of an annuity of 1 per year payable, after the change, on each anniversary of the policy where a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred.\n\n(ii) The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided by the policy.\n\n(B) This amount equals the present value of an annuity of 1 per year payable, after the change, on each anniversary of the policy where a premium falls due.\n\n(15) For a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, the policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for the substandard policy may be calculated as if they were issued to provide the higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.\n\n(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) through (H) of this paragraph, adjusted premiums and present values shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or, at the election of the company for any specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors.\n\n(ii) Adjusted premiums and present values shall for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table.\n\n(iii) Adjusted premiums and present values shall for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate for policies issued in the calendar year.\n\n(B) At the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of an interest rate not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.\n\n(C) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and the interest rate used to determine the amount of the paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and the paid-up dividend additions.\n\n(D) A company may calculate the guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than the rate specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.\n\n(E) In calculating the present value of a paid-up term insurance with pure endowment offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed shall be no more than the rates in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for ordinary insurance policies and no more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for industrial insurance policies.\n\n(F) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the tables described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph.\n\n(i) For policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and by the Commissioner determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\n(ii) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners Standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard shall supersede the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(i) For policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners Standard Industrial Mortality Tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by the Commissioner for determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\n(ii) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners Standard Mortality Table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners Standard Industrial Mortality Table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies or contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard shall supersede the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(A) The nonforfeiture interest rate for policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual in a particular calendar year shall be equal to 125% of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the policy, as described in § 31-4701, rounded to the nearest 1/4%; provided, that the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than 4.00%.\n\n(B) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.\n\n(18) Any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for a previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of other provisions of the policy form.\n\n(A) After March 14, 1985, a company may file with the Commissioner a written notice of the company’s election to comply with this subsection after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for the category of insurance for the company.\n\n(B) If a company makes no election for a category of insurance, the operative date for the category of insurance issued by the company shall be January 1, 1989.\n\n(f) For life insurance with future premiums determined by the insurance company based on estimates of future experience or for life insurance with minimum values that cannot be determined according to subsections (a) through (e) of this section, the following requirements shall be complied with:\n\n(1) The Commissioner shall be satisfied that the benefits are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the benefits required by subsections (a) through (e) of this section.\n\n(2) The Commissioner shall be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums do not mislead prospective policyholders or insureds.\n\n(3) The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits shall not be less than the minimum values and benefits required by this section.\n\n(1) Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available after a default in the payment of a premium due other than on the policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary.\n\n(2) All values described in subsections (b) through (f) of this section may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy or contract year of death.\n\n(3) Besides paid-up term additions, the net value of paid-up additions shall be at least the amounts used to provide the additions.\n\n(A) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, additional benefits payable under the following conditions shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits under this section:\n\n(i) For death or dismemberment by accident.\n\n(ii) For total and permanent disability.\n\n(iii) Reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits.\n\n(iv) Term insurance benefits provided by a rider or by a supplementary policy provision which if issued as a separate policy would not be under this section.\n\n(v) Term insurance on the lives of children under a policy on the life of a parent of the children if the term insurance expires before a child’s age is 26, if the term insurance is

benefits, and premiums for the additional benefits.\n\n(B) No additional benefits described in paragraph (4)(A) of this subsection shall be required in paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\n(1) This subsection shall apply to policies issued after December 31, 1986.\n\n(2) For uniform amounts of insurance, a cash surrender value available after a default on a premium due on a policy anniversary

zero or the basic cash value, whichever is greater.\n\n(B) The present value of existing paid-up additions exceeding policy indebtedness to the company.\n\n(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, the basic cash value shall equal the present value at the policy anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits exceeding the present value on nonforfeiture factors corresponding with premiums due after the eve of the anniversary.\n\n(B) The future guaranteed benefits used to determine the basic cash value excludes existing paid-up additions and, where there has been no default in premium payments, would be computed without deducting indebtedness to the company.\n\n(C) The basic cash value for supplemental life insurance, annuity benefits, or family coverage shall not be affected differently than cash surrender values described in subsections (b) and (d) of this section.\n\n(A) The nonforfeiture factor for a policy year shall be a percentage of the

paragraph (4) formula by replacing the nonforfeiture factors with adjusted premiums.\n\n(A) Adjusted premiums and present values shall be calculated on the mortality and interest rate bases permitted by the Life Insurance Amendments Reform Act of 1984.\n\n(B) The cash surrender values all include endowment benefits under the policy.\n\n(A) Except for a defaulted premium due on a policy anniversary, a cash surrender value and a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit arising from a premium default shall be determined consistently with subsections (a) through (g) of this section.\n\n(B) The

      "text": "(a) This section shall not apply to any reinsurance, group annuity purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts of individual retirement annuities under § 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (88 Stat. 959; § 408 of Title 26, United States Code), as now or hereafter amended, premium deposit fund, variable contract, immediate annuity, any deferred annuity contract after annuity payments have commenced, or reversionary annuity, nor to any contract which shall be delivered outside the District of Columbia through an agent or other representative of the company issuing the contract.\n\n(1) In the case of contracts issued on or after the operative date of this section as defined in subsection (k) of this section, no contract of annuity, except as stated in subsection (a) of this section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in the District of Columbia unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the Commissioner are at least as favorable to the contract holder:\n\n(A) That upon cessation of payment of considerations under a contract, the company will grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), and (i) of this section;\n\n(B) If a contract provides for a lump-sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the company will pay in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit as cash surrender benefit of such amount as is specified in subsections (d), (e), (g), and (i) of this section. The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of such cash surrender benefit for a period of 6 months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract;\n\n(C) A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of such benefits; and\n\n(D) A brief and general statement of the method to be used in calculating any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract and an explanation of the manner in which such benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract, any indebtedness to the company on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, any deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of 2 full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid prior to such period would be less than $20 monthly, the company may at its option terminate such contract by payment in cash of the then present value of such portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by such payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under such contract.\n\n(c) The minimum values as specified in subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), and (i) of this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this subsection:\n\n(A) With respect to contracts providing for flexible considerations, the minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to such time at a rate of interest of 1.5% per year of percentages of the net considerations (as hereinafter defined) paid prior to such time, decreased by the sum of:\n\n(i) Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrender of the contract accumulated at a rate of interest of 1.5% per year; and\n\n(ii) The amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued; and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract;\n\n(A-i) Notwithstanding the interest rate of 1.5% per year used to calculate the minimum nonforfeiture amount under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Mayor shall issue regulations which shall set forth the computation of the interest rate used to determine the minimum nonforfeiture amount. The regulations shall apply to any contract issued on or after the effective date of the regulations.\n\n(B) The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount not less than 0 and shall be equal to the corresponding gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year less an annual contract charge of $30 and less a collection charge of $1.25 per consideration credited to the contract during that contract year. The percentages of net considerations shall be 65% of the net consideration for the 1st contract year and 87 1/2% of the net considerations for the 2nd and later contract years. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence, the percentage shall be 65% of the portion of the total net consideration for any renewal contract year which exceeds by not more than 2 times the sum of those portions of the net considerations in all prior contract years for which the percentage was 65%;\n\n(2) With respect to contracts providing for fixed scheduled considerations, minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be calculated on the assumption that considerations are paid annually in advance and shall be defined as for contracts with flexible considerations which are paid annually with 2 exceptions:\n\n(A) The portion of the net consideration for the 1st contract year to be accumulated shall be the sum of 65% of the net consideration for the 1st contract year plus 22 1/2% of the excess of the net consideration for the 1st contract year over the lesser of the net considerations for the 2nd and 3rd contract years; and\n\n(B) The annual contract charge shall be the lesser of $30 or 10% of the gross annual consideration;\n\n(3) With respect to contracts providing for a single consideration, minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be defined as for contracts with flexible considerations except that the percentage of net consideration used to determine the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be equal to 90% and the net consideration shall be the gross consideration less a contract charge of $75.\n\n(d) Any paid-up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date. Such present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract.\n\n(e) For contracts which provide cash surrender benefits, such cash surrender benefits available prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit which would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, such present value being calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than 1 percent higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. In no event shall any cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under such contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.\n\n(f) For contracts which do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid prior to the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, such present value being calculated for the period prior to the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. For contracts which do not provide any death benefits prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, such present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit. However, in no event shall the present value of the paid-up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at the time.\n\n(g) For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under subsections (e) and (f) of this section, in the case of annuity contracts under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be deemed to be the latest date for which election shall be permitted by the contract, but shall not be deemed to be later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant’s 70th birthday or the 10th anniversary of the contract, whichever is later.\n\n(h) Any contract which does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided.\n\n(i) Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs.\n\n(j) For any contract which provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), and (i) of this section, additional benefits payable: (1) in the event of total and permanent disability; (2) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits; or (3) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits; and considerations for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section. The inclusion of such additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless such additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.\n\n(k) After October 13, 1978, any company may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date which is no more than 2 years after such effective date. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date of this section for such company, this section shall become operative with respect to annuity contracts thereafter issued by such company. If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this section for such company shall be 2 years after October 13, 1978.",

Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this paragraph or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:\n\n(A) A provision as follows:\n\n(B) A provision as follows:\n\n(i) A provision as follows:\n\n(ii) Or, in lieu thereof: “Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.”.\n\n(i) A provision as follows:\n\n(ii) If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase “—EXPENSE INCURRED BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other jurisdiction of the United States or any province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workmen’s compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no 3rd party liability coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”\n\n(i) A provision as follows:\n\n(ii) If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase “—OTHER BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other jurisdiction of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workmen’s compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no 3rd-party liability coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”\n\n(i) A provision as follows:\n\n(ii) The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums until at least age 50 or in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss-of-time coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other jurisdiction of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workmen’s compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations;\n\n(G) A provision as follows:\n\n(H) A provision as follows:\n\n(I) A provision as follows:\n\n(J) A provision as follows:\n\n(K) Repealed.\n\n(3) If any provision of this subsection is in whole or in part inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form of policy the insurer, with the approval of the Commissioner, shall omit from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage provided by the policy.\n\n(4) The provisions which are the subject of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, or any corresponding provisions which are used in lieu thereof in accordance with such paragraphs, shall be printed in the consecutive order of the provisions in such paragraphs or, at the option of the insurer, any such provision may appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered, delivered, or issued.\n\n(5) The word “insured,” as used in this section, shall not be construed as preventing a person other than the insured with a proper insurable interest from making application for and owning a policy covering the insured or from being entitled under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits, and rights provided therein.\n\n(6) The Council of the District of Columbia may make such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to this section as are necessary, proper or advisable to the administration of this section. This provision shall not abridge any other authority granted the Commissioner by law.\n\n(1) No policy provision which is not subject to subsection (c) of this section shall make a policy, or any portion thereof, less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary then the provisions thereof which are subject to this section.\n\n(2) A policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in the District in violation of this section shall be held valid but shall be construed as provided in this section. When any provision in a policy subject to this section is in conflict with any provision of this section, the rights, duties, and obligations of the insurer, the insured, and the beneficiary shall be governed by the provisions of this section.\n\n(1) The insured shall not be bound by any statement made in an application for a policy unless a copy of such application is attached to or endorsed on the policy when issued as a part thereof. If any such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in the District shall be reinstated or renewed, and the insured or the beneficiary or assignee of such policy shall make written request to the insurer for a copy of the application, if any, for such reinstatement or renewal, the insurer shall, within 15 days after the receipt of such request at its home office or any branch office of the insurer, deliver or mail to the person making such request, a copy of such application. If such copy shall not be so delivered or mailed, the insurer shall be precluded from introducing such application as evidence in any action or proceeding based upon or involving such policy or its reinstatement or renewal.\n\n(2) No alteration of any written application for any such policy shall be made by any person other than the applicant without his written consent, except that insertions may be made by the insurer, for administrative purposes only, in such manner as to indicate clearly that such insertions are not to be ascribed to the applicant.\n\n(3) The falsity of any statement in the application for any policy covered by this section may not bar the right to recovery thereunder unless such false statement materially affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer.\n\n(f) The acknowledgment by any insurer of the receipt of notice given under any policy covered by this section, or the furnishing of forms for filing proofs of loss, or the acceptance of such proofs, or the investigation of any claim thereunder shall not operate as a waiver of any of the rights of the insurer in defense of any claim arising under such policy.\n\n(g) If any such policy contains a provision establishing, as an age limit or otherwise, a date after which the coverage provided by the policy will not be effective, and if such date falls within a period for which premium is accepted by the insurer or if the insurer accepts a premium after such date, the coverage provided by the policy will continue in force subject to any right of cancellation until the end of the period for which premium has been accepted. In the event the age of the insured has been misstated and if, according to the correct age of the insured, the coverage provided by the policy would not have become effective, or would have ceased prior to the acceptance of such premium or premiums, then the liability of the insurer shall be limited to the refund, upon request, of all premiums paid for the period not covered by the policy.\n\n(h) Except as provided in § 31-4724, nothing in this section shall apply to or affect:\n\n(1) Repealed.\n\n(2) Life insurance, endowment or annuity contracts, or contracts supplemental thereto which contain only such provisions relating to accident and sickness insurance as:\n\n(A) Provide additional benefits in case of death or dismemberment or loss of sight by accident; or\n\n(B) Operate to safeguard such contracts against lapse, or to give a special surrender value or special benefit or an annuity in the event that the insured or annuitant shall come to have a total and permanent disability, as defined by the contract or supplemental contract; provided, that no such supplemental contract shall be issued or delivered to any person in the District unless and until a copy of the form thereof has been submitted to and approved by the Commissioner under such reasonable rules and regulations as the Council of the District of Columbia shall make concerning the provisions in such contracts and their submission to and approval by him.",
