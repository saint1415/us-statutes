Upon such motion, the judicial officer may issue a warrant for the arrest of the person and if the person is outside the District of Columbia, the person shall be brought before a judicial officer in the district where the person is arrested and shall then be transferred to the District of Columbia for proceedings in accordance with this section.\n\n(e) The judicial officer shall, in determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community, take into account information available concerning:\n\n(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence or dangerous crime as these terms are defined in § 23-1331, or involves obstruction of justice as defined in § 22-722;\n\n(2) The weight of the evidence against the person;\n\n(3) The history and characteristics of the person, including:\n\n(A) The person’s character, physical and mental condition, family ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, and record concerning appearance at court proceedings; and\n\n(B) Whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, the person was on probation, on parole, on supervised release, or on other release pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under local, state, or federal law; and\n\n(4) The nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the person’s release.\n\n(f) In a release order issued under § 23-1321(b) or (c), the judicial officer shall:\n\n(1) Include a written statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the release is subject, in a manner sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the person’s conduct;\n\n(2) Advise the person of:\n\n(A) The penalties for violating a condition of release, including the penalties for committing an offense while on pretrial release;\n\n(B) The consequences of violating a condition of release, including immediate arrest or issuance of a warrant for the person’s arrest; and\n\n(C) The provisions of § 22-722, relating to threats, force, or intimidation of witnesses, jurors, and officers of the court, obstruction of criminal investigations and retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant; and\n\n(3) Beginning on September 1, 2024, where there is a rebuttable presumption of detention pursuant to either subsection (c) of this section or § 23-1325(a), the judicial officer shall include a written statement of the reasons for the release, setting forth the evidence that supported the rebuttal of the presumption.\n\n(g) In a detention order issued under subsection (b) of this section, the judicial officer shall:\n\n(1) Include written findings of fact and a written statement of the reasons for the detention;\n\n(2) Direct that the person be committed to the custody of the Attorney General of the United States for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal; provided, that after October 1, 2018, if the person is younger than 18 years of age, direct that the person be transferred to the custody of the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, subject to the federal standards under 28 C.F.R. § 115.14;\n\n(3) Direct that the person be afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation with counsel; and\n\n(4) Direct that, on order of a judicial officer or on request of an attorney for the government, the person in charge of the corrections facility in which the person is confined deliver the person to the United States Marshal or other appropriate person for the purpose of an appearance in connection with a court proceeding.\n\n(1) The case of the person detained pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be placed on an expedited calendar and, consistent with the sound administration of justice, the person shall be indicted before the expiration of 90 days, and shall have trial of the case commence before the expiration of 100 days. However, the time within which the person shall be indicted or shall have the trial of the case commence may be extended for one or more additional periods not to exceed 45 days each on the basis of a petition submitted by the attorney for the government and approved by the judicial officer. The additional period or periods of detention may be granted only on the basis of good cause shown, including due diligence and materiality, and shall be granted only for the additional time required to prepare for the expedited indictment and trial of the person. Good cause may include, but is not limited to, the unavailability of an essential witness, the necessity for forensic analysis of evidence, the ability to conduct a joint trial with a co-defendant or co-defendants, severance of co-defendants which permits only one trial to commence within the time period, complex or major investigations, complex or difficult legal issues, scheduling conflicts which arise shortly before the scheduled trial date, the inability to proceed to trial because of action taken by or at the behest of the defendant, an agreement between the government and the defense to dispose of the case by a guilty plea on or after the scheduled trial date, or the breakdown of a plea on or immediately before the trial date, and allowing reasonable time to prepare for an expedited trial after the circumstance giving rise to a tolling or extension of the 100-day period no longer exists. If the time within which the person must be indicted or the trial must commence is tolled or extended, an indictment must be returned at least 10 days before the new trial date.\n\n(2) For the purposes of determining the maximum period of detention under this section, the period shall begin on the latest of:\n\n(A) The date the defendant is first detained under subsection (b) of this section by order of a judicial officer of the District of Columbia after arrest;\n\n(B) The date the defendant is first detained under subsection (b) of this section by order of a judicial officer of the District of Columbia following a re-arrest or order of detention after having been conditionally released under § 23-1321 or after having escaped;\n\n(C) The date on which the trial of a defendant detained under subsection (b) of this section ends in a mistrial;\n\n(D) The date on which an order permitting the withdrawal of a guilty plea becomes final;\n\n(E) The date on which the defendant reasserts his right to an expedited trial following a waiver of that right;\n\n(F) The date on which the defendant, having previously been found incompetent to stand trial, is found competent to stand trial;\n\n(G) The date on which an order granting a motion for a new trial becomes final; or\n\n(H) The date on which the mandate is filed in the Superior Court after a case is reversed on appeal.\n\n(3) After 100 days, as computed under paragraphs (2) and (4) of this section, or such period or periods of detention as extended under paragraph (1) of this section, the defendant shall be treated in accordance with § 23-1321(a) unless the trial is in progress, has been delayed by the timely filing of motions, excluding motions for continuance, or has been delayed at the request of the defendant.\n\n(4) In computing the 100 days, the following periods shall be excluded:\n\n(A) Any period from the filing of the notice of appeal to the issuance of the mandate in an interlocutory appeal;\n\n(B) Any period attributable to any examination to determine the defendant’s sanity or lack thereof or his or her mental competency or physical capacity to stand trial;\n\n(C) Any period attributable to the inability of the defendant to participate in his or her defense because of mental incompetency or physical incapacity; and\n\n(D) Any period in which the defendant is otherwise unavailable for trial.\n\n(i) Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.",
