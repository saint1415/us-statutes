and\n\n(B) The annual payment to each public charter school for the operating expenses of each public charter school.\n\n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection the amount of the annual payment under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be calculated by multiplying a uniform dollar amount used in the formula established under such paragraph by:\n\n(A) The number of students calculated under § 38-1804.02 that are enrolled at District of Columbia public schools, in the case of the payment under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection;

and\n\n(ii) The cost of educating students at such certain grade levels.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, the State Superintendent of Education, with the advice and consent of the District of Columbia Council, may adjust the amount of the annual payment under paragraph (1) of this subsection to increase the amount of such payment if a District of Columbia public school or a public charter school serves a high number of students:\n\n(i) With special needs;\n\n(ii) Who do not meet minimum literacy standards;

In no case shall such withholding be taken from Special Education Payments made to the school in any fiscal year.\n\n(E) If a public charter school relinquishes its charter or if a final decision is made by the eligible chartering authority to revoke the charter as described in § 38-1802.13, the public charter school shall refund to OSSE the unexpended amount of the Special Education Payment necessary to ensure compliance with 34 CFR § 300.203. In no case shall federal funds, for which accountability to the federal government is required, be used to pay this liability.\n\n(2) Expenditure of Special Education Payments by public schools are restricted for use in accordance with allowable special education costs unless an LEA is in compliance with 34 CFR § 300.203 and has received an Annual Determination as required by 34 CFR § 300.600(a) of “Meets Requirements” for the most recent year for which this information is available.\n\n(3) Expenditures for attorney fees related to IDEA due process hearings pursuant to 34 CFR § 300.517 may not be paid from Special Education Payments; except that such fees may be paid from funds received for Special Education Compliance Funding. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a public school from paying for attorney fees from other non-special education portions of its Formula payments.\n\n(4) All Special Education Payments must be expended within the fiscal year within which they were appropriated, unless the LEA is in compliance with the IDEA maintenance of effort requirements in 34 CFR § 300.203 and received an Annual Determination of “Meets Requirements” under 34 CFR § 300.600(a).\n\n(A) If DCPS or a public charter school does not have an Annual Determination of “Meets Requirements” and fails to expend in its entirety Special Education Payments on allowable special education costs within the fiscal year within which the funds are appropriated, the public school must reserve the full amount of unspent funds.

      "text": "Congress finds the following:\n\n(1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their children, including the educational setting that will best serve the interests and educational needs of their child.\n\n(2) For many parents in the District of Columbia, public school choice provided under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as well as under other public school choice programs, is inadequate. More educational options are needed to ensure all families in the District of Columbia have access to a quality education. In particular, funds are needed to provide low-income parents with enhanced public opportunities and private educational environments, regardless of whether such environments are secular or nonsecular.\n\n(3) While the per student cost for students in the public schools of the District of Columbia is one of the highest in the United States, test scores for such students continue to be among the lowest in the Nation. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), an annual report released by the National Center for Education Statistics, reported in its 2009 study that students in the District of Columbia were being outperformed by every State in the Nation. On the 2009 NAEP, 56 percent of fourth grade students scored “below basic” in reading, and 44 percent scored “below basic” in mathematics. Among eighth grade students, 49 percent scored “below basic” in reading and 60 percent scored “below basic” in mathematics. On the 2009 NAEP reading assessment, only 17 percent of the District of Columbia fourth grade students could read proficiently, while only 13 percent of the eighth grade students scored at the proficient or advanced level.\n\n(4) In 2003, Congress passed the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-199; 118 Stat. 126), to provide opportunity scholarships to parents of students in the District of Columbia to enable them to pursue a high-quality education at a public or private elementary or secondary school of their choice. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (DC OSP) under such Act was part of a comprehensive 3-part funding arrangement that also included additional funds for the District of Columbia public schools, and additional funds for public charter schools of the District of Columbia. The intent of the approach was to ensure that progress would continue to be made to improve public schools and public charter schools, and that funding for the opportunity scholarship program would not lead to a reduction in funding for the District of Columbia public and charter schools. Resources would be available for a variety of educational options that would give families in the District of Columbia a range of choices with regard to the education of their children.\n\n(5) The DC OSP was established in accordance with the Supreme Court decision, Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002), which found that a program enacted for the valid secular purpose of providing educational assistance to low-income children in a demonstrably failing public school system is constitutional if it is neutral with respect to religion and provides assistance to a broad class of citizens who direct government aid to religious and secular schools solely as a result of their genuine and independent private choices.\n\n(6) Since the inception of the DC OSP, it has consistently been oversubscribed. Parents express strong support for the opportunity scholarship program. Rigorous studies of the program by the Institute of Education Sciences have shown significant improvements in parental satisfaction and in reading scores that are more dramatic when only those students consistently using the scholarships are considered. The program also was found to result in significantly higher graduation rates for DC OSP students.\n\n(7) The DC OSP is a program that offers families in need, in the District of Columbia, important alternatives while public schools are improved. This program should be reauthorized as 1 of a 3-part comprehensive funding strategy for the District of Columbia school system that provides new and equal funding for public schools, public charter schools, and opportunity scholarships for students to attend private schools.",
