No person may begin excavation or demolition until receiving notification from the one-call center that the notices from the utility operators have been provided.\n\n(1) When the actual excavation or demolition operation enters the immediate vicinity of an underground facility, the person responsible for excavation or demolition shall provide adequate protection to the underground facility, including the provision of support as needed, and expose the underground facility by hand digging.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"immediate vicinity of an underground facility\" means the space within 18 inches from the outermost part of the underground facility to the proposed excavation marked in the field.\n\n(e) Repealed.\n\n(f) Repealed.\n\n(g) The notification through the one-call center is valid for 15 days excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, from the time of notification to the one-call center. Three days before the end of the 15-day period, or at any time when line-location markings on the ground become illegible, the person excavating or demolishing shall contact the one-call center and request the re-marking of the lines. The utility operator shall re-mark the lines as soon as possible. However, the re-marking of the lines shall be completed within 48 hours from the time of the request.\n\n(h) For the purposes of this section, a District of Columbia agency or instrumentality shall mark buried infrastructure for traffic operations, including streetlights and traffic signals.",
