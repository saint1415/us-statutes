If judicial action appears warranted, under intake criteria established by rule of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the Director of Social Services, or the Director of the Agency shall recommend that a petition be filed. If the Director of Social Services, in the case of a complaint alleging delinquency or need of supervision, decides not to recommend the filing of a petition, the complainant shall have a right to have that decision reviewed by the Corporation Counsel. The Director of Social Services, in the case of a complaint alleging delinquency or need of supervision, shall notify the complainant of such right of review. Complaints alleging neglect submitted by the Agency shall be referred directly to the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia.\n\n(b) Petitions initiating judicial action may be signed by any person who has knowledge of the facts alleged or, being informed of them, believes they are true, except that petitions alleging need of supervision may only be signed by the Director of Social Services, a representative of a public agency or a nongovernmental agency licensed and authorized to care for children, a representative of a public or private agency providing social service for families, a school official, or a law enforcement officer. Petitions shall be verified and verification may be upon information or belief.\n\n(1) Each petition shall be prepared by the Corporation Counsel after an inquiry into the facts and a determination of the legal basis for the petition. If the Director of Social Services has refused to recommend the filing of a delinquency petition, or if the Director of the Agency has refused to recommend the filing of a neglect petition, the Corporation Counsel, on request of the complainant, shall review the facts presented and shall prepare and file a petition if he believes such action is necessary to protect the community or the interests of the child. Any decision of the Corporation Counsel on whether to file a petition shall be final.\n\n(2) Where the delinquency petition filed by the Corporation Counsel is the 3rd petition filed against a child and the child is 13 years old or younger, the Child and Family Services Agency shall institute a child neglect investigation against the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child.\n\n(d) A petition shall be filed by the Corporation Counsel within seven days (excluding Sundays and legal holidays) after the complaint has been referred to the Director of Social Services, except as otherwise provided in section 16-2312. A petition shall set forth plainly and concisely the facts which give the Division jurisdiction of the child under section 11-1101(13). In delinquency cases the petition shall also state the specific statute or ordinance on which the charge is based. If delinquency or need of supervision is alleged, a statement shall be included in the petition that the child appears to be in need of care or rehabilitation. The petition shall contain such other facts and information as may be required by rules of the Superior Court.\n\n(e) A petition may be amended by leave of the Division on motion of the Corporation Counsel or counsel for the child, at any time prior to the conclusion of the factfinding hearing. The Division shall grant the Corporation Counsel, the child, and his parent, guardian, or custodian notice of the amendment and, where necessary, additional time to prepare.\n\n(f) The District of Columbia shall be a party to all proceedings under this subchapter.",

This report and all social records that are to be made available to the judge at the transfer hearing shall be made available to counsel for the child and to the Corporation Counsel at least three days prior to the hearing.\n\n(g) A judge who conducts a hearing pursuant to this section shall not, over the objection of the child for whom a motion to transfer was filed, participate in any subsequent factfinding proceedings relating to the offense.\n\n(h) Transfer of a child for criminal prosecution terminates the jurisdiction of the Division over the child with respect to any subsequent delinquent act; except that jurisdiction of the Division over the child is restored if (1) the criminal prosecution is terminated other than by a plea of guilty, a verdict of guilty, or a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, and (2) at the time of the termination of the criminal prosecution no indictment or information has been filed for criminal prosecution for an offense alleged to have been committed by the child subsequent to transfer.",

or\n\n(ii) Unarmed murder, first-degree sexual abuse, carjacking, or assault with intent to commit any such offense; or\n\n(B) Committed CPWL, carrying a pistol without a license.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this subsection, the terms “dangerous crime” and “crime of violence” shall have the same meanings as provided in section 23-1331, except that these terms shall not include:\n\n(A) Any felony offense under Chapter 27 of Title 22 (Prostitution, Pandering);\n\n(B) Any felony offense under Chapter 9 of Title 48 (Controlled Substances);\n\n(C) Burglary;

or\n\n(iii) Despite the exercise of due diligence by the District and the federal agency, DNA evidence, analysis of controlled substances, or other evidence processed by federal agencies has not been completed.\n\n(i) Upon a motion by or on behalf of the child consistent with the rules of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the factfinding hearing of a child ordered into secure detention or a child who is ordered into shelter care may be continued for additional periods not to exceed 30 days each.\n\n(ii) A motion made under sub-subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph shall not be construed as a waiver of the child’s speedy trial rights under this section nor under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\n(D) Additional continuances of the factfinding hearing may be granted to the Office of Attorney General if the child is no longer in either secure detention or shelter care.\n\n(3) In determining whether good cause has been shown as required by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Division shall take into account, among other appropriate matters, and shall state its findings on the record, as to whether:\n\n(A) There has been or will be a delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the child, including, but not limited to, examinations to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the child; from a hearing with respect to other charges against the child; from any interlocutory or expedited appeal; from the making, or consideration by the Division, of any pretrial motions; and from any proceeding relating to the transfer of the child pursuant to § 16-2307;\n\n(B) Any essential witness is absent or unavailable. For purposes of this subparagraph, an essential witness shall be considered absent when his or her whereabouts are unknown or cannot be determined by due diligence and shall be considered unavailable when his or her presence for the hearing cannot be obtained by due diligence;\n\n(C) Despite the exercise of due diligence, necessary autopsies, medical examinations, fingerprint examinations, ballistic tests, drug analysis, or other scientific tests have not been completed; or\n\n(D) The ends of justice served by continuing the period of detention outweigh the interests of the child and public in a speedy trial.\n\n(4) Upon motion by or on behalf of the child, a child in secure detention or shelter care shall be released from custody or shelter care if the fact finding hearing is not commenced within the time period set forth in this subsection.\n\n(f) No provision of this section shall be construed as a bar to any claim of denial of speedy trial as required by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.",

The written finding of the psychiatrist or qualified psychologist shall be a part of the Division’s order. These procedures for the inpatient mental health examination of a child shall not apply if the child is subject to the emergency hospitalization provisions of section 21-521.\n\n(A) Hospitalization for an examination shall be for a period of not more than 21 days, except that the Division may grant extensions which may not exceed 21 days in the aggregate if a psychiatrist or qualified psychologist certifies that a mental health examination has not been completed and cannot be effectively provided on an outpatient basis.\n\n(B) If the examination is to determine whether the child is incompetent to proceed, an extension of time may not be granted unless the psychiatrist or qualified psychologist also certifies that the psychiatrist or qualified psychologist is unable to determine whether the child is incompetent to proceed and needs an additional period of time to complete the examination.\n\n(b-1) A report of a mental health examination ordered under this section to determine whether a child is incompetent to proceed shall be made in writing and served on the court and the attorneys of record. The report shall include:\n\n(1) An assessment of the child’s capacity to understand the proceedings against him, including the nature of the charges and range of potential options available to the court at disposition;\n\n(2) An assessment of the child’s ability to assist his attorney; and\n\n(3) If the report concludes the child is incompetent to proceed:\n\n(A) The reasons and bases for the conclusion;\n\n(B) The suspected cause of the incompetence;\n\n(C) An assessment of the likelihood of the child attaining competence in the reasonably foreseeable future; and\n\n(D) If the child is assessed to be likely to attain competence in the reasonably foreseeable future:\n\n(i) Any recommended treatment and services that may render the child competent in the reasonably foreseeable future; and\n\n(ii) A certification as to the least restrictive setting for providing such treatment and services.\n\n(1) If as a result of mental examination the Division determines that a child alleged to be delinquent is incompetent to proceed under the petition and is unlikely to attain competence in the reasonably foreseeable future, it shall suspend further proceedings and the Corporation Counsel shall, where appropriate, initiate commitment proceedings pursuant to Chapter 5 or 11 of Title 21.\n\n(A) If as a result of mental examination the Division determines that a child alleged to be delinquent is incompetent to proceed under the petition and is likely to attain competence in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Division shall order that the child receive such treatment on an outpatient basis, unless a psychiatrist or qualified psychologist certifies and the Division finds that inpatient hospitalization is the least restrictive setting for providing treatment and services that may render the child competent in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n\n(B) If the Division determines that hospitalization is not appropriate, the child may be ordered into detention or shelter care if detention or shelter care would otherwise be warranted pursuant to section 16-2310 while receiving treatment and services that may render the child competent in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n\n(3) If an order for inpatient hospitalization is made under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Division may order the child sent to a hospital or mental health facility or unit designated by the Mayor as appropriate for treatment of juveniles alleged to be delinquent.\n\n(4) If, at any time after the child is ordered to undergo treatment under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the psychiatrist or qualified psychologist responsible for the treatment believes the child is competent, or, in the case of a child hospitalized under paragraph (3) of this subsection, determines that inpatient hospitalization is no longer the least restrictive setting for providing treatment and services that may render the child competent, the psychiatrist or qualified psychologist shall immediately send a report to the Division and attorneys of record stating the basis for the conclusion that the child has attained competency or that inpatient hospitalization is no longer the least restrictive setting.\n\n(A) The Division shall hold a prompt hearing upon receipt of a report under paragraph (4) of this subsection, and no more than once in a 45-day period, the Division, on motion of the child or the Corporation Counsel, may hold a hearing to determine the child’s progress toward attaining competence.\n\n(B) At any hearing conducted pursuant to this paragraph, the Division shall determine whether continued treatment and services are supported by a finding that the child is likely to attain competence in the reasonably foreseeable future. Where the psychiatrist or qualified psychologist has reported that inpatient hospitalization is no longer the least restrictive setting for providing treatment and services that may render the child competent, the Division shall order that any further treatment and services be rendered on an outpatient basis. In such case, the Division may order the child into detention or shelter care if detention or shelter care would otherwise be warranted pursuant to section 16-2310 while receiving continued treatment and services.\n\n(6) The psychiatrist or qualified psychologist responsible for the treatment of the child shall ensure that a report is prepared and submitted to the Division and attorneys of record every 2 months, or at such shorter intervals as ordered by the court, from the date the treatment order is issued under paragraph (2) of this subsection. The report shall contain information regarding the child’s progress toward attaining competency, the treatment being provided, and any recommendations regarding changes to the treatment that would be likely to aid in achieving the goal of the order. If the child is hospitalized, the report shall also include a statement indicating whether inpatient hospitalization continues to be the least restrictive setting for providing treatment and services that may render the child competent in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n\n(A) No child ordered into a hospital, detention, or shelter care while receiving treatment and services under this section shall be so confined for more than 180 days, except the Division may order such confinement to continue for up to 180 more days if it finds that:\n\n(i) The child remains incompetent to proceed;\n\n(ii) There is a substantial probability the child will attain competence within the period of continued confinement; and\n\n(iii) In the case of a hospitalized child, that inpatient hospitalization continues to be the least restrictive setting for providing treatment and services that may render the child competent to proceed.\n\n(B) If at the end of 360 days a child so confined remains incompetent to proceed, and remains likely to attain competence in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Division shall lift the hospitalization, detention, or shelter care order and may order that the child receive on an outpatient basis such further treatment and services as may render the child competent in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n\n(8) If the Division at any time determines that the child receiving treatment and services under this subsection is unlikely to attain competence in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Division shall suspend further proceedings and the Corporation Counsel shall, where appropriate, initiate commitment proceedings pursuant to Chapter 5 or 11 of Title 21.\n\n(9) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the Corporation Counsel from initiating commitment proceedings pursuant to Chapter 5 or 11 of Title 21 at any time.\n\n(d) The results of an examination under this section shall be admissible in a transfer hearing pursuant to section 16-2307, in a dispositional hearing under this subchapter, or in a commitment proceeding under Chapter 5 or 11 of Title 21. The results of examination may be admitted into evidence at a factfinding hearing to aid the Division in determining a material allegation of the petition relating to the child’s mental or physical condition, but not for the purpose of establishing a defense of insanity.\n\n(1) At any time following the filing of a petition which alleges a neglected child as defined by D.C. Official Code, section 16-2301(9)(C) the Division may, on its own motion or the motion of any party, for good cause shown, order the mental or physical examination of the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child whose ability to care for the child is at issue.\n\n(2) Following an adjudication that a child is neglected, the Division may, on its own motion or the motion of any party, order a mental or physical examination of the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child whose ability to care for the child is at issue.\n\n(3) The Division may order additional mental examinations to be performed by independent experts upon a showing by any party that a prior examination is inadequate.\n\n(4) The results of the mental or physical examination shall not be admissible evidence in the factfinding hearing unless the allegations contained in the petition set forth facts which support a petition pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 16-2301(9)(C).\n\n(5) The results of the mental or physical examination shall be admissible at a dispositional hearing.\n\n(6) The results of the mental or physical examination shall not be admissible as evidence in any criminal proceedings.\n\n(f) Upon request of the Corporation Counsel, or his or her designee, the Division shall hold a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a victim or eyewitness to a delinquent act alleged to have been committed by the respondent may have been put at risk for the HIV/AIDS virus. If the Division finds there is probable cause that a victim or eyewitness has been put at risk for the HIV/AIDS virus as a result of witnessing or being the victim of the delinquent act alleged to have been committed by the respondent, the Division shall order that the respondent be tested for the HIV/AIDS virus. The results of the child’s HIV/AIDS testing shall be presented to the Corporation Counsel, or his or her designee, who shall provide the information to the respondent and to the victim or eyewitness to a delinquent act. The victim or eyewitness may only disclose the respondent’s identity to a doctor or counselor.",

The Division shall have the authority to (i) order any public agency of the District of Columbia to provide any service the Division determines is needed and which is within such agency’s legal authority and (ii) order any private agency receiving public funds for services to families or children to provide any such services when the Division deems it is in the best interests of the child and within the scope of the legal obligations of the agency.\n\n(6) Terminate the parent and child relationship for the purpose of seeking an adoptive placement for the child pursuant to subchapter III of this chapter.\n\n(b) Unless a child found neglected is also found to be delinquent, he shall not be committed to, or confined in, an institution for delinquent children.\n\n(c) If a child is found to be delinquent or in need of supervision, the Division exercising juvenile jurisdiction shall also have jurisdiction over any natural person who is a parent or caretaker of the child to secure the parent or caretaker’s full cooperation and assistance in the entire rehabilitative process and may order any of the following dispositions which will be in the best interest of the child:\n\n(1) Any disposition authorized by subsection (a) of this section (other than paragraphs (3)(A) and (5) thereof).\n\n(2) Transfer of legal custody to a public agency for the care of delinquent children; provided, that legal custody shall not be transferred to a public agency for the care of delinquent children when the child in question is less than 10 years of age.\n\n(3) Probation under such conditions and limitations as the Division may prescribe, including but not limited to the completion of parenting classes or family counseling in cases where either or both was ordered by the Division.\n\n(c-1) The Division shall order any child between the ages of 14 and 18 years who is found to be delinquent or in need of supervision to perform a minimum of 90 hours of community service with an agency of the District government or a non-profit or community service organization in accordance with section 24-904(a).\n\n(c-2) When determining what disposition shall be ordered under subsection (c) of this section, the Division shall consider any victim impact statement submitted to the Division and the victim, or the immediate family members of the victim when the victim is a child or when the victim is deceased or incapacitated, shall have the right to make a statement at the disposition hearing.

The Division may order the parent or guardian to make restitution directly to the victim, governmental entity, or third-party payor after consideration of the parent or guardian’s financial ability to pay.\n\n(1) A judgment of restitution under this section may not exceed:\n\n(A) As to property stolen, destroyed, converted, or unlawfully obtained, the lesser of the fair market value of the property or $10,000;\n\n(B) As to property damaged, or substantially decreased in value, the lesser of the amount of damage or the decrease in value of the property, not to exceed the fair market value of the property, or $10,000;\n\n(C) As to personal injuries inflicted, the lesser of the actual medical, dental, hospital, funeral, and burial expenses incurred by the injured person as a result of the injury or $10,000; or\n\n(D) As to counseling or mental health expenses, the lesser of the actual expenses incurred by the injured person as a result of the incident or $10,000.\n\n(2) As an absolute limit in each case against any one child, his or her parents or guardians, or both, a judgment rendered under this section may not exceed $10,000 for all acts arising out of a single incident.\n\n(d) A restitution hearing to determine the liability of a parent or guardian, a child, or both, shall be held within 30 days after the disposition hearing and may be extended by the Division for good cause. A hearing under this section may be held as part of a factfinding or disposition hearing for the child. A judgment of restitution against a parent or guardian may not be entered unless the parent or guardian has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present appropriate evidence in the parent or guardian’s behalf.\n\n(e) In a restitution hearing, a written statement or bill for medical, dental, hospital, funeral, or burial expenses, or repair and replacement of property shall be prima facie evidence that the amount indicated on the written statement or bill represents a fair and reasonable charge for the services or materials provided. The burden of proving that the amount indicated on the written statement or bill is not fair and reasonable shall be on the person challenging the fairness and reasonableness of the amount.\n\n(f) Upon request of the Corporation Counsel or the recipient of a judgment of restitution, the Division may enforce the judgment for restitution under this section in the same manner that a monetary judgment is enforced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia under Title 15 and applicable court rules.\n\n(g) The Director of Social Services shall be responsible for monitoring the collection and disbursement of restitution payments when the judgment of restitution provides that restitution is to be made in periodic or installment payments. The Director of Social Services shall inform the Division of the progress or status of the restitution payments.\n\n(h) A judgment of restitution under this section shall not preclude a civil action to recover damages from the child, parent, or guardian.

An order requiring an adult to pay a judgment for restitution shall be filed in a special proceedings case.\n\n(k) An order of restitution requiring a parent or guardian, a child, or both to pay restitution constitutes a judgment and lien against all property of the person or persons required to pay for the amount they are obligated to pay under the order and may be recorded in any office for the filing of liens against real or personal property.\n\n(l) A judgment of restitution may be enforced by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, a victim entitled under the order to receive restitution, a deceased victim’s estate, or any other beneficiary of the judgment in the same manner as a civil judgment.\n\n(m) A judgment for restitution that is filed in a special proceedings case shall contain the following information:\n\n(1) The amount of the restitution; and\n\n(2) The terms of the restitution, including the length of time in which restitution payments will be made and the amount of the installment payments.\n\n(n) The court shall provide each victim in a juvenile case with a notarized and sealed copy of the Order of Restitution or Reparation.\n\n(o) In addition to the information that is included in a judgment for restitution filed in a special proceedings case, the Division shall provide the following information in a supplemental information form attached to the order. This information shall be kept confidential except by order of the Division:\n\n(1) The full name, address, telephone number, and social security number of the restitution payer or person who is ordered to pay the restitution; and\n\n(2) The full name, address, and telephone number of the recipient of the restitution.\n\n(p) All restitution payments shall be paid to the Superior Court.

For the purposes of this section a “child with special needs” includes any child who is difficult to place in adoption because of age, race, ethnic background, physical or mental condition, or membership in a sibling group which should be placed together, or a child who, in all likelihood, would go without another permanent placement arrangement except for the acceptance of the child as a member of the permanent guardian’s family.\n\n(b) For a permanent guardian to be eligible for subsidy payments under this section:\n\n(1) The child must be adjudicated neglected pursuant to section 16-2317;\n\n(2) The child must be committed to the legal custody of the Child and Family Services Agency;\n\n(3) Repealed; and\n\n(4) A subsidy payment agreement must be entered into by the Child and Family Services Agency and the permanent guardian.\n\n(c) Subsidy payments allowed under this section may be paid, subject to the availability of appropriated funds necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, on a long-term basis to help a permanent guardian whose income is limited and likely to remain so, or on a time-limited basis to help a permanent guardian meet the cost of integrating a child into the family over a specified period of time.\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, eligibility for subsidy payments under this section may continue during the period of the guardianship order until the child reaches 18 years of age.\n\n(2) For guardianships that are finalized on or after May 7, 2010, eligibility for subsidy payments under this section shall continue during the period of the guardianship order until the child reaches 21 years of age.\n\n(e) No subsidy payment to a permanent guardian shall be made on behalf of any child with respect to whom a guardianship order has been entered by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, pursuant to this subchapter, before October 1, 2000.\n\n(f) Once during each calendar year and at other times during the year when changed conditions and costs are deemed by the Mayor to warrant review, the Mayor shall review the need for continuing each permanent guardianship subsidy. A permanent guardian who is subject to a subsidy agreement under this section may request, in writing, at any time, for reasons set forth in the request, a review of the amount of the payment or the level of continuing payments. Such review shall begin not later than 30 days from the receipt of the request by the Mayor. At the time of a review, appropriate adjustments in payment shall be made based upon changes in the needs of the child. Any adjustment may be made retroactive to the date a request for review was received by the Mayor. If a request for review is not acted on within 30 days after it has been received by the Mayor, or if the Mayor modifies or terminates an agreement without the concurrence of all parties, any party to the agreement shall be entitled to a hearing under the applicable provisions of subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2.\n\n(g) The Mayor shall disseminate information to prospective permanent guardians as to eligibility for subsidy under this section.\n\n(h) The Mayor shall keep such records as are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of permanent guardianship subsidies as a means of encouraging and promoting the placement of children with special needs with permanent guardians. The Mayor shall make an annual progress report which shall be open to public inspection. The report shall include the number of children placed with permanent guardians under subsidy payment agreements during the year preceding the annual report and the major characteristics of the children placed.\n\n(i) Permanent guardianship subsidies shall be subject to the availability of appropriations. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create an entitlement to a permanent guardianship subsidy for any person.\n\n(j) The Mayor, pursuant to subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2, may issues rules to implement the provisions of this section.",
