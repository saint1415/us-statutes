If the Council does not approve, in whole or in part, the proposed regulations by resolution with the [90-day period of review], the regulations shall be deemed approved. The schedule shall replace all civil penalties, except as expressly provided in this title.\n\n(b) The schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n(1) The schedule shall contain 2 tiers that reflect the severity of the violation for which the penalty is imposed:\n\n(A) The primary tier shall apply to more severe violations, including service to minors or violation of hours of sale or service of alcoholic beverages.\n\n(B) The secondary tier shall apply to less severe violations, including the failure to post required signs.\n\n(2) A subsequent violation in the same tier, whether a violation of the same provision or different one, shall be treated as a repeat violation for the purposes of imposing an increased penalty; provided, that all secondary tier infractions cited by ABCA investigators or Metropolitan Police Department Officers, during a single investigation or inspection on a single day, shall be deemed to be one secondary tier violation for the purposes of determining repeat violations under this section.\n\n(1) For primary tier violations, the penalties shall be no less than the following:\n\n(A) For the first violation, no less than $1,000;\n\n(B) For the second violation within 2 years, no less than $2,000;\n\n(C) For the third violation within 3 years, no less than $4,000;\n\n(D) For the fourth violation within 4 years, the Board shall revoke the licensee’s license or fine the licensee no less than $30,000 and suspend the licensee’s license for 30 consecutive days; and\n\n(E) For the fifth violation within 4 years, the Board shall revoke the licensee’s license.\n\n(2) Repealed.\n\n(3) Repealed.\n\n(4) Repealed.\n\n(1) For secondary tier violations, the penalties shall be no less than the following:\n\n(A) For the first violation, no less than $250.\n\n(B) For the second violation within 2 years, no less than $500.\n\n(C) For the third violation within 3 years, no less than $750.\n\n(D) For the fourth violation within 4 years, no less than $1,000.\n\n(E) For the fifth violation or subsequent within 4 years, no less than $2,000.\n\n(F) [Repealed].\n\n(2) Repealed.\n\n(1) Except for an egregious violation as may be later defined by ABC rulemaking, no licensee shall be found to be in violation of a first-time violation of § 25-781 (sales to minors), unless the licensee has been given a written warning, or received a citation, for the violation, or had an enforcement proceeding before the Board, during the 4 years preceding the violation.\n\n(2) A warning for a first-time violation of § 25-781 shall include a description of the violation. The Alcoholic Beverage and Cannabis Administration shall make available a schedule of fines that could be imposed upon subsequent violation.
