      "text": "The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:\n\n(1) There is a severe shortage of rental housing available to citizens of the District of Columbia (“District”).\n\n(2) The shortage of housing is growing due to the withdrawal of housing units from the housing market, deterioration of existing housing units, and the lack of development of new or rehabilitation of vacant housing units.\n\n(3) The shortage of housing is felt most acutely among low- and moderate-income renters, who are finding a shrinking pool of available dwellings.\n\n(4) The cost of basic accommodation is so high as to cause undue hardship for many citizens of the District of Columbia.\n\n(5) Many low- and moderate-income tenants need assistance to cover basic shelter costs, but the assistance should maximize individual choice.\n\n(6) The Rent Stabilization Program (“Program”) has a more substantial impact upon small housing providers than on large housing providers, and small housing providers find it more difficult to use the administrative machinery of the Program.\n\n(7) Many small housing providers are experiencing financial difficulties and are in need of some special mechanisms to assist them and their tenants.\n\n(8) The present Rent Stabilization Program should not be continued indefinitely and new approaches must be investigated to prevent the withdrawal of rental housing units from the market and the deterioration of existing rental housing units, and to increase the rental housing supply.\n\n(9) The housing crisis in the District has not substantially improved since the passage of the Rental Housing Act of 1980.\n\n(10) The Rent Stabilization Program should be extended for 6 years.\n\n(11) This extension of the Rent Stabilization Program is required to preserve the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare.",

The certificate shall establish:\n\n(1) That the improvement is required by the provisions of a federal or District statute or regulation becoming effective after October 30, 1980;\n\n(2) The amount of the cost of the improvements; and\n\n(3) That required governmental permits and approvals have been secured.\n\n(i) The housing provider may petition the Rent Administrator for approval of the rent adjustment for any capital improvements made under subsection (g) of this section, if the petition is filed with the Rent Administrator within 10 calendar days from the installation of the capital improvements.\n\n(j) The housing provider may petition the Rent Administrator to assess capital improvement increases in the rent charged against elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities, and the Rent Administrator shall approve the petition if the housing provider proves to the satisfaction of the Rent Administrator that the amount which would be collectible from elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities at the housing accommodation, but for the provisions of § 42-3502.06(f), would exceed the amount of real property taxes that would be payable during the calendar year with respect to the housing accommodation, but for the provisions of § 42-3502.06(g).",

Appropriations for the Tenant Assistance Program shall be classified and maintained as a proprietary fund and shall remain available until expended, without regard to fiscal year limitations. No money appropriated for the Tenant Assistance Program shall be expended for any purpose other than making tenant assistance payments and, when necessary, repayable advances for security deposits in accordance with this subchapter.\n\n(c) If in any fiscal year the Mayor finds that tenant assistance payments will exceed available appropriations, the Mayor shall transmit to the Council proposed adjustments to eligibility criteria, income guidelines, or supplement payments to reduce payments under this subchapter to an amount not in excess of available appropriations.\n\n(d) The Mayor is authorized to expend the annual appropriations provided by this section in the following manner:\n\n(A) The Mayor may enter into long-term tenant assistance contracts with housing providers. Payments obligated by long-term contracts may be made on an annual basis during the period of each contract from the annual appropriations for the Tenant Assistance Program. Each contract entered into pursuant to this paragraph shall obligate the housing provider, on an annual basis, for the duration of the contract to offer for lease and to lease a fixed number of rental units, which shall be specified in the contract, to families receiving tenant assistance, regardless of whether the same family leases the same unit throughout the contract period. Each contract shall obligate the Mayor to make tenant assistance payments to the housing provider for the duration of the contract in accordance with the terms of the contract and the requirements of this subchapter as long as the housing is in substantial compliance with the housing regulations. The contractual obligation of the Mayor shall be backed by the full faith and credit of the District to the same extent that applies to District contracts generally.\n\n(B) In the case of contracts for rental units in existing housing accommodations, the length of the contract may be from 1 to 5 years. In the case of contracts for rental units in newly constructed or rehabilitated housing accommodations, the length of the contract may be from 1 to 15 years, with options to renew in 5-year increments.\n\n(C) Consistent with the requirements of § 42-3508.04(d), distressed properties and new or rehabilitated vacant rental housing receiving assistance pursuant to subchapter VIII of this chapter shall have priority over other properties for the long-term contracts authorized by this paragraph.\n\n(2) Repealed.\n\n(3) The Mayor may expend funds from the annual appropriation to assist eligible families with a current valid lease of a rental unit that qualifies according to the provisions of this chapter.

Unit A of Chapter 3 of Title 2 shall not apply to the contracts authorized by this subchapter.\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the fair market rents applicable to the Tenant Assistance Program shall be the fair market rents established annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) for new construction and substantial rehabilitation in the Washington, D.C., market. The Department, by rule, may establish the fair market rents for units in sizes for which there is no fair market rent established by HUD. If the Department, after reviewing the fair market rents established by HUD for the Washington, D.C., market, determines that the amounts do not accurately reflect fair market rents in the District, the Department may, by rule, adjust the amounts. If the proposed fair market rents vary from the fair market rents established by HUD, the Department shall submit a resolution for approval of the proposed fair market rents to the Council of the District of Columbia (“Council”) for a 45-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed resolution, in whole or in part, within this 45-day review period, the proposed resolution shall be deemed approved.\n\n(c) Applications to participate in the Tenant Assistance Program shall be submitted to the Department and shall be in a form designated by the Department. The Department shall be responsible for verifying the sources of the family’s income and gathering information necessary for determining eligibility and the amount of the assistance payment. Priority shall be given to the elderly, individuals with disabilities, single-parent households, and applicants who have completed any employment training course provided by any District agency.\n\n(d) If an applicant is determined by the Department to be eligible and is selected for participation, the applicant shall be given a certificate of eligibility. At the same time, the family shall be given a certificate holder’s packet which contains a request for lease approval, a list of properties for rent, information concerning recently completed housing, if any, including the location, and other items the Department determines should be included. In addition, the Department shall provide a full explanation of the following to assist the family in finding a suitable rental unit and to apprise the family and the housing provider of their respective responsibilities:\n\n(1) Family and housing provider responsibilities under the lease contract;\n\n(2) The general locations and characteristics of the neighborhood in which units of suitable quality and price may be found;\n\n(3) Applicable laws and housing standards;\n\n(4) Significant aspects of applicable federal and District law, including fair housing law;\n\n(5) The applicable fair market rent; and\n\n(6) Information on how the Department computes the amount of the tenant assistance payment.\n\n(e) Upon determination of eligibility the Department shall enter on each certificate the smallest unit-size appropriate for the eligible family consistent with the following criteria:\n\n(1) The number of bedrooms indicated as appropriate shall not require more than 2 persons to occupy the same bedroom.\n\n(2) The number of bedrooms indicated as appropriate shall not require persons of the opposite sex other than spouses, except for children under 12 years of age, to occupy the same bedroom.\n\n(3) All single-person households shall be assigned a 0-bedroom unit if 0-bedroom units are available. Where there are no 0-bedroom units available, single-person households shall be assigned a 1-bedroom unit. A single, elderly person or single person with a disability planning to live with an unrelated person essential to his or her care may be assigned a 2-bedroom unit.\n\n(1) The Department shall maintain a system to assure that it will be able to honor all outstanding certificates of eligibility with its funding authorization.\n\n(2) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as creating an entitlement to assistance payments in the absence of appropriations sufficient to fund this program.\n\n(1) The certificate of eligibility shall expire at the end of 90 days unless within that time the family submits a completed request for lease approval. If the certificate expires, or is about to expire, the family may submit the certificate to the Department with a request for an extension. The Department may grant 1 or more 60-day extensions to any family that continuously demonstrates good faith efforts to locate a suitable rental unit. Expiration of the certificate shall not preclude the family from filing a new application for another certificate.\n\n(2) If an assisted family notifies the Department that it wishes to obtain another certificate of eligibility for the purpose of moving to another rental unit within the District, the Department shall issue another certificate or process a request for lease approval, unless the Department determines that the housing provider is entitled to payment under § 42-3503.04(d) on account of nonpayment of rent or other amount owed under the lease, and that the family has failed to satisfy any liability.\n\n(h) Owners of rental accommodations in the District shall notify tenants of the existence of the Tenant Assistance Program and shall refer interested parties to the Department for further information.",

Where the head of household is an elderly tenant or tenant with a disability, the amount of the tenant assistance payment shall be the amount by which the actual rent or fair market rent, whichever is lower, exceeds 25% of the family’s monthly income. Monthly income is 1/12 of annual adjusted income. Annual income is the anticipated total income from all sources received by the family head and spouse, even if temporarily absent, and by each additional member of the family, including all net income derived from assets, for the 12-month period following the effective date of the Department’s initial determination or reexamination of income, exclusive of income that is temporary, nonrecurring, or sporadic such as irregular gifts, scholarships, inheritances, insurance payments, and capital gains. Annual income is also exclusive of income from employment of children, including foster children, under the age of 18 years; payments received for the care of foster children; the value of the allotment provided to an eligible household for coupons under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. §§ 2011-2030); and payments or allowances made under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.), and the District of Columbia Low Income Energy Assistance Program.\n\n(2) Annual income includes, but is not limited to:\n\n(A) The full amount, before any payroll deductions, of wages and salaries, overtime pay, commissions, fees, tips and bonuses, and other compensation for personal services;\n\n(B) The net income from operation of a business or profession (for this purpose, expenditures for business expansion or amortization of capital indebtedness and an allowance for depreciation of capital assets shall not be deducted to determine the net income from a business);\n\n(C) Interest, dividends, and other net income of any kind from real or personal property (for this purpose, expenditures for amortization of capital indebtedness and an allowance for depreciation of capital assets shall not be deducted to determine the net income from real or personal property). Where the family has net family assets in excess of $5,000, annual income shall include the greater of the actual income derived from all net family assets or a percentage of the value of the assets based on the current passbook savings rate as determined by the Department;\n\n(D) The full amount of periodic payments received from Social Security annuities, insurance policies, retirement funds, pensions, disability or death benefits or other similar types of periodic receipts, including a lump-sum payment for the delayed start of a periodic payment;\n\n(E) Welfare assistance;\n\n(F) Payments in lieu of earnings, such as unemployment and disability compensation, worker’s compensation, and severance pay;\n\n(G) Periodic and determinable allowances, such as alimony and child support payments, and regular contributions or gifts received from persons not residing in the rental unit;\n\n(H) All regular pay, special pay, and allowances of a member of the armed forces, whether or not living in the rental unit, who is head of the family, spouse, or other person whose dependents are residing in the unit; and\n\n(I) Any earned income tax credit to the extent it exceeds income tax liability.\n\n(b) The Department shall compute the tenant assistance payment for a family entering the Tenant Assistance Program on the most recent published fair market rents on the date of lease approval for the family.\n\n(1) Except in the case of elderly tenants or tenants with a disability, no tenant assistance payment shall exceed 60% of the amount of rent for the recipient’s rental unit. In the case of persons receiving tenant assistance payments on and before March 17, 1993, and continuously thereafter, this subsection shall apply 2 years from October 21, 1993.\n\n(2) In the case of persons who are granted Tenant Assistance Program certification after March 17, 1993, if those persons have previously received Tenant Assistance Program subsidies, the subsidies provided those persons shall not exceed 60% of the amount of rent for the recipient’s rental unit.\n\n(c) Under the tenant assistance payment computation described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the amount of tenant assistance payment does not increase if the unit rents for more than the applicable fair market rent, but a tenant is not prohibited from renting such a unit.\n\n(d) The Department shall not reimburse the housing provider for the portion of the rent not covered by the tenant assistance payment, damages, or other amounts due under the lease.\n\n(e) If a family moves out, the housing provider shall promptly notify the Department and the Department shall make no additional tenant assistance payments to the housing provider for any month after that in which the family moves. The housing provider may retain the tenant assistance payment for the month in which the family moves.\n\n(f) Repealed.\n\n(1) A family with a certificate of eligibility is responsible for finding a rental unit suitable to the family’s needs and desires. A family may select the rental unit which it already occupies if the unit qualifies. Upon request, the Department shall assist families in finding units where, because of age, disability, large family size, or other reasons, the family is unable to locate an approvable unit. The Department shall also provide this assistance where the family alleges that illegal discrimination on grounds of race, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability is preventing it from finding a suitable unit.\n\n(2) Neither in assisting a family in finding a unit nor by any other action shall the Department directly or indirectly reduce the family’s opportunity to choose among the available units in the housing market, except in accordance with § 42-3503.02(d).",

Regardless of the number of bedrooms stated on the certificate of eligibility, the Department shall not prohibit a family from renting an otherwise acceptable unit on the ground that it is too large for the family. If the Department determines that the assisted unit occupied by a participating family does not meet the space requirement because of an increase in family size or a change in family composition, the Department shall issue the participating family a new certificate of eligibility. If an acceptable unit is found that is available for occupancy by the family, the Department shall terminate the tenant assistance contract for the original unit in accordance with its terms.\n\n(d) The following maintenance, operation, and inspection requirements shall apply:\n\n(1) The housing provider shall provide all the services, maintenance, and utilities which the housing provider agrees to provide under the contract, subject to abatement of housing assistance payments or other applicable remedies if the housing provider fails to meet these obligations.\n\n(2) A housing provider may collect a security deposit from a family not to exceed 1 month’s rent. If the family determines it is unable to pay the security deposit, it may apply to the Department for a repayable advance to cover the difference between the amount the family can afford, as determined by the Department, and the security deposit requested by the housing provider.

After deducting the amount used to reimburse the housing provider, the housing provider shall refund promptly to the family the full amount of the unused balance.\n\n(4) The Department shall conduct reexaminations of family income and composition at least annually.

Such an application fee will be no more than $50.\n\n(2) Beginning on January 1, 2024, the application fee specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection may be adjusted annually by the housing provider, or his or her agent, commensurate with an increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n(3) A housing provider shall not charge a prospective tenant any fee other than an application fee prior to signing a lease with the tenant.\n\n(4) When a housing provider permits a tenant to find a replacement tenant, assign the lease, or sublet, a housing provider may require the outgoing tenant to pay a replacement fee, which shall not exceed the amount permitted as an application fee under this subsection.\n\n(5) A housing provider shall not require a holding deposit from a prospective tenant who is using a government-funded housing voucher.\n\n(b-1) When a prospective tenant applies for a unit that is owned or operated by a housing provider and within 30 calendar days the tenant applies to one or more other units within the District that are owned or operated by the same housing provider, the housing provider shall charge the prospective tenant only one application fee unless the housing provider is required to perform more than one screening.\n\n(1) A housing provider shall not charge a fee to a prospective tenant before move-in, during a tenancy, or after move-out for services required of the housing provider to maintain a unit in a condition consistent with the implied warranty of habitability and with Titles 12 and 14 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations, or substantially similar subsequent regulations;

or\n\n(B) Was filed 3 or more years ago.\n\n(2) Any allegation of a breach of lease by the prospective tenant if the alleged breach:\n\n(A) Stemmed from an incident that the prospective tenant demonstrates may constitute a defense to an action for possession under § 42-3505.01(c-1) or a federal law pertaining to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, including records of civil or criminal protection orders sought or obtained by the prospective tenant or of criminal matters in which the prospective tenant is a witness;\n\n(B) Stemmed from an incident in which the prospective tenant was a victim of a crime in the unit subject to the lease;\n\n(C) Is related to the prospective tenant or household member's disability; or\n\n(D) Took place 3 or more years ago.\n\n(1) A housing provider shall not base an adverse action solely on a prospective tenant's credit score or lack thereof, although information within a credit or consumer report directly relevant to fitness as a tenant can be relied upon by a housing provider.\n\n(2) It shall not be considered a violation of this section if a housing provider receives a credit or consumer report containing information that may not be used as the basis of an adverse action pursuant to subsection (d) of this section; provided, that the housing provider did not specifically request or inquire about this information and can demonstrate that he or she did not base an adverse action on such information.\n\n(f) If a housing provider takes an adverse action, he or she shall provide a written notice of the adverse action to the prospective tenant no later than the response date provided to the prospective tenant pursuant to subsection (a)(7) of this section that includes:\n\n(1) The specific grounds for the adverse action;\n\n(2) A copy or summary, free of charge, of any information obtained from a third party that formed a basis for the adverse action;\n\n(3) A statement informing the prospective tenant of his or her right to dispute the accuracy of and permissibility of the housing provider's use of any information upon which the housing provider relied in making his or her adverse action determination; and\n\n(4) A statement informing the prospective tenant of his or her right to file a complaint with the Office of Human Rights if he or she believes a housing provider violated this section.\n\n(1) After receipt of a notice of an adverse action, a prospective tenant may provide to the housing provider any evidence that information relied upon by the housing provider is:\n\n(A) Inaccurate or incorrectly attributed to the prospective tenant; or\n\n(B) Based upon prohibited criteria under subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(2) The housing provider shall provide a written response, which may be by mail, electronic mail, or in person, to the prospective tenant with respect to any information provided under this subsection within 10 days after receipt of the information from the prospective tenant.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a housing provider from considering debts owed to a housing authority, any other criteria established in federal law, or from leasing a housing rental unit to other prospective tenants.\n\n(1) A prospective tenant may file a complaint with the Office of Human Rights if he or she believes that a housing provider violated this section. If the Office of Human Rights determines that there is probable cause to believe that a housing provider has knowingly violated this section, the Office of Human Rights shall certify the complaint to the Commission on Human Rights. The Commission on Human Rights may impose the following penalties, of which half shall be awarded to the complainant and half shall deposited into the General Fund of the District of Columbia:\n\n(A) For a housing provider that owns or leases 1 to 10 rental units, a fine of up to $1,000;\n\n(B) For a housing provider that owns or leases 11 to 19 rental units, a fine of up to $2,500; and\n\n(C) For a housing provider that owns or leases 20 or more rental units, a fine of up to $5,000.\n\n(2) The fines set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection may be doubled for any provider that:\n\n(A) Violates this section more than twice within a calendar year; or\n\n(B) Fails to implement a corrective action ordered by the Commission on Human Rights within 90 days after the corrective action is ordered.\n\n(3) For any violation that occurs within 6 months after the applicability date of this subsection, the Commission on Human Rights shall issue warnings and orders to correct in lieu of penalties. The Commission on Human Rights may impose penalties as provided in this subsection for violations that occur more than 6 months after the applicability date of this subsection.\n\n(4) The Mayor, pursuant to subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2, may issue rules to implement the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(1) A prospective tenant may bring a civil action in Superior Court against a housing provider who violates this section within one year after the alleged violation; except, that prospective tenant may not pursue a civil action against a housing provider if he or she has filed a complaint with the Office of Human Rights pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(2) When a prospective tenant prevails in a civil action brought pursuant to this subsection, he or she shall be entitled to the following relief:\n\n(A) Reasonable attorney's fees and costs;\n\n(B) Incidental damages; and\n\n(C) Equitable relief as may be appropriate.\n\n(j) For the purposes of this section, the term:\n\n(1) \"Adverse action\" means:\n\n(A) Denial of a prospective tenant's rental application; or\n\n(B) Approval of a prospective tenant's rental application, subject to terms or conditions different and less-favorable to the prospective tenant than those included in any written notice, statement, or advertisement for the rental unit, including written communication sent directly from the housing provider to a prospective tenant.\n\n(2) \"Tenant screening\" means any process used by a housing provider to evaluate the fitness of a prospective tenant.",
