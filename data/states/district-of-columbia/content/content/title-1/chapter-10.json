Tabulation shall proceed in rounds, with each round proceeding sequentially as follows:\n\n(1) If a candidate has a majority of votes among active candidates in a round of tabulation, that candidate shall be elected or nominated, and tabulation shall be complete; or\n\n(2) If no candidate has a majority of votes among active candidates in a round of tabulation:\n\n(A) The active candidate with the fewest votes shall be defeated;\n\n(B) Each vote for the defeated candidate shall be transferred to each ballot's next-ranked active candidate; and\n\n(C) A new round of tabulation shall begin with the step set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n\n(e) In any general election contest for at-large members of the Council, in which there shall be 2 winners, each ballot shall count as one vote for the highest-ranked active candidate on that ballot.

Tabulation shall proceed in rounds, with each round proceeding sequentially as follows:\n\n(1) If the percentage of total votes cast for each active candidate is above the party's threshold for receiving delegates, then tabulation shall be complete; or\n\n(2) If there are any active candidates whose percentage of the vote total is below the party's threshold for receiving delegates:\n\n(A) The active candidate with the fewest votes shall be defeated;\n\n(B) Each vote for the defeated candidate shall be transferred to each ballot's next-ranked active candidate; and\n\n(C) A new round of tabulation shall begin with the step set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n\n(g) In any presidential preference primary election that awards delegates to a single candidate on a winner-take-all basis, tabulation shall proceed under subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude a political party from allocating delegates according to its own rules.\n\n(i) In any round of tabulation in a contest conducted by ranked choice voting:\n\n(1) An inactive ballot shall not count for any candidate; and\n\n(2) An undervote shall not count for any candidate.\n\n(j) If 2 or more active candidates are tied for the fewest votes and tabulation cannot continue until one such candidate is eliminated, the candidate to be eliminated shall be determined by lot immediately under an automated procedure to be established by the Board. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section, if 2 or more candidates are tied for the greatest number of votes and the tie must be broken to determine the winner or nominee, that tie shall be resolved pursuant to § 1-1001.10(c).\n\n(1) If there are fewer than 3 qualified candidates on the ballot in a primary, general, or special election for electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Mayor, Attorney General, Chairman of the Council, Delegate to the House of Representatives, members of the Council other than those covered by paragraph (2) of this subsection, members of the State Board of Education, United States Senator, United States Representative, Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, or any other elected official as defined in § 1-1001.02(13), that election shall not be conducted by ranked choice voting. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this section, in such elections, the ballot shall allow voters to select a single candidate, and the candidate receiving the most votes shall be nominated or elected.\n\n(2) If there are fewer than three qualified candidates on the ballot in a general election for at-large members of the Council, that election shall not be conducted by ranked choice voting.

The Board shall formulate rules and regulations not inconsistent with this subchapter to prescribe the form of watchers’ credentials, to govern the conduct of such watchers, and to limit the number of watchers so that the conduct of the election will not of the election will not be unreasonably obstructed. Such rules and regulations should provide fair opportunity for watchers for all candidates or groups of candidates to challenge prospective voters whom the watchers believe to be unqualified to vote, to question the accuracy in the vote count, and otherwise to observe the conduct of the election at the Vote Center and the counting of votes.\n\n(c-1) The Board shall issue rules for granting access to the electoral process, including access to Vote Centers, ballot tabulation centers, and other similar locations, to election observers. The rules shall consider the need to avoid disruption and crowding in Vote Centers and ballot tabulation centers and the need to ensure that all questions posed by observers should be answered as fully, accurately, and cooperatively as possible. Election observers shall be allowed uniform and nondiscriminatory access to all stages of the election process, including the certification of election technologies, early and mail-in voting, and vote tabulation. The Board shall issue a public notice with respect to any denial of a request by any election observer for access to any Vote Center for purposes of observing an election. The notice shall be issued not later than 24 hours after the denial.\n\n(1) A registered voter may challenge another voter’s status as a qualified elector of the District of Columbia by stating in writing the name of the person challenged, the basis for the challenge, and the evidence provided to support the challenge. The challenger shall sign an affidavit, declaring under penalty of perjury, that the challenge is based upon substantial evidence which the challenger believes in good faith shows that the person challenged is not a qualified elector of the District. After receiving a challenge or making a challenge, the site coordinator or other official in charge of the Vote Center shall give the challenged voter an opportunity to respond.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, a voter shall not be challenged solely on the basis of characteristics or perceived characteristics not directly related to the challenged voter’s status as a registered qualified elector, including race, color, religion, sex, personal appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, matriculation status, political affiliation, or physical disability. The Board may remove a site coordinator or void the credentials of an authorized watcher, or refer the matter for prosecution as a violation of § 1-1001.12, if the Board determines that the site coordinator or the watcher has violated the provisions of this paragraph.\n\n(3) The site coordinator shall review the evidence presented and shall affirm the challenge if the site coordinator finds that it is based on substantial evidence specific to the voter being challenged and probative of the challenged voter’s status as a qualified elector. The site coordinator shall deny the challenge if the site coordinator finds that the challenge is not based on substantial evidence that is specific to the voter being challenged and probative of the challenged voter’s status as a qualified elector. The site coordinator shall record the decision and the rationale for the decision on a form provided by the Board.\n\n(4) If the site coordinator denies the challenge, the site coordinator shall inform the challenger that the challenger may appeal the decision to the Board and shall give the challenger copies of the rules regarding challenges and appeals to the Board. Any appeal of the site coordinator's decision to deny the challenge shall be made either before the challenged voter casts a regular ballot, or before either the challenger or the challenged voter leaves the Vote Center, whichever is earlier. If the challenger does not appeal the site coordinator's decision to deny the challenge, the challenged voter shall cast a regular ballot.\n\n(5) If the challenger appeals the site coordinator's decision to deny the challenge, the site coordinator shall state the facts of the case to the Board’s hearing officer, who is authorized to rule on the appeal for the Board. A Board member, the Board’s Executive Director, or the Board’s chief voter registration official may serve as the Board’s hearing officer for the appeal. The site coordinator shall contact the hearing officer by telephone. The hearing officer shall ensure that the hearing is recorded, and shall take testimony under oath from the challenger, the person challenged, the site coordinator, and any witnesses to the challenge who wish to testify. Each person who testifies before the hearing officer shall state for the record their:\n\n(A) Name as recorded on the Board’s voter registration list;\n\n(B) Residence address, mailing address, and telephone number; and\n\n(C) Role in the challenge.\n\n(6) The hearing officer shall receive evidence and testimony pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection and then shall close the hearing. The hearing officer shall review all of the evidence presented pertaining to the challenge and make a decision regarding the appeal, based on the hearing officer's determination of whether the challenger has presented substantial evidence that is specific to the voter being challenged and probative of the challenged voter’s status as a qualified elector. The recording of the hearing shall be transcribed and shall serve as the official case record along with the written documentation of the site coordinator's initial decision to deny the challenge.\n\n(7) The hearing officer shall notify the site coordinator of the hearing officer's decision on the appeal of the unsuccessful challenge, and the site coordinator shall notify each party of the hearing officer's decision. If the hearing officer affirms the site coordinator's decision to deny the challenge, the challenged voter shall cast a regular ballot. The site coordinator shall inform the challenger of the challenger's right to appeal the decision of the Board hearing officer to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. If the hearing officer overturns the site coordinator's decision to deny the challenge, the challenged voter shall be allowed to vote only by casting a paper ballot marked \"challenged\" in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (8) of this subsection.\n\n(8) If the site coordinator affirms the challenge made at the Vote Center, or if the Board's hearing officer overturns the decision of the site coordinator to deny a challenge, the site coordinator shall allow the person to vote only by casting a paper ballot marked \"challenged\" and shall provide the voter with written notification of the voter's right of appeal pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. Challenged ballots shall be segregated, and no challenged ballot shall be counted until the challenge has been removed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. The site coordinator shall not allow the challenged voter to cast a \"challenged\" ballot unless the voter signs an affidavit swearing or affirming, under penalty of perjury, that the voter is a qualified registered elector in the District of Columbia who resides in the precinct for which the ballot is to be cast, and if applicable, the Advisory Neighborhood Commission single-member district in which the ballot is to be cast.\n\n(d-1) Any individual who alleges that their name has been erroneously omitted from the list of registered voters, or alleges that their name, address or party affiliation is erroneously printed on the list of registered voters, shall be permitted to cast a ballot. Ballots so cast shall be placed in a sealed envelope. The outside of the envelope shall contain the signature of the voter and such information as the Board deems necessary to determine that the individual is qualified to have the vote counted. The official in charge of the Vote Center shall provide the voter with written notification of appeal rights as provided in subsection (e) of this section, should the Board determine that the voter is not qualified to vote in the election.\n\n(d-2) Any individual who votes in a federal election as a result of a court order or other order that extends the time established for closing the polls by a District law in effect 10 days before the date of that election shall vote in that election by casting a special ballot. Any ballot cast under this subsection shall be separated and held apart from other special ballots not affected by the order.\n\n(1) A voter’s signing of a challenged or special ballot envelope shall be deemed as the filing of an appeal by the voter of the refusal by the Board’s chief voter registration official to permit the voter to vote during early voting or on election day by regular ballot, and a waiver of personal notice from the Board of any denial or refusal to a later count of the challenged or special ballot. The Board shall review all available evidence pertaining to the eligibility of each voter casting a challenged or special ballot, and shall make a preliminary decision about whether to count or to reject each challenged or special ballot based on its review of the available evidence.\n\n(2) The Board shall maintain a toll-free telephone service during regular business hours for any person who has voted by a challenged or special ballot to learn the Board’s preliminary decision whether to count or reject the person's ballot and the reason for each decision.\n\n(3) If the Board has made a preliminary determination that a challenged ballot shall not be counted, it shall afford the challenged voter an opportunity to contest that determination in a hearing before the Board. The hearings authorized pursuant to this paragraph shall take place no earlier than 8 days and no later than 10 days after that election. The Board shall inform the voter of the date scheduled for the hearing and the manner by which the voter may learn the Board's final decision to count or reject the voter's challenged ballot. The notice shall be in writing and shall be provided to the voter at the time of voting. At the hearing, the voter may appear and testify. The Board shall make a final determination within one day after the date of the hearing. The voter may appeal the decision of the Board to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia within one business day after the date of the Board's decision. The decision of the court shall be final and not appealable.\n\n(4) If the Board has determined that a special ballot shall not be counted, it shall afford the voter an opportunity to contest that determination in a hearing held before the Board no earlier than 8 days and no later than 10 days after any election held pursuant to this subchapter. The Board shall inform the voter in writing, at the time of voting, of the date scheduled for the hearing and the manner by which the voter may learn whether the Board has decided to count or reject the voter's special ballot. The Board shall make a final determination within one day after the date of the hearing. The voter may appeal the decision of the Board to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia within one business day after the date of the Board's decision. The decision of the court shall be final and not appealable.\n\n(f) If a qualified elector is unable to record the qualified elector's vote by marking the ballot or operating the voting machine an official of the Vote Center shall, on the request of the voter, enter the voting booth and comply with the voter’s directions with respect to recording the qualified elector's vote. Upon the request of any such voter, a second official of the Vote Center shall also enter the voting booth and witness the recordation of the voter’s directions. The official or officials shall in no way influence or attempt to influence the voter’s decisions, and shall tell no one how the voter voted. The official in charge of the voting place shall make a return of all such voters, giving their names and disabilities.\n\n(1) No person shall vote more than once in any election nor shall any person vote in a primary or party election held by a political party other than that to which the person has declared themselves to be a member.\n\n(2) A name written on a ballot in any election shall not be counted as valid unless the individual whose name is written on the ballot has complied with the requirements of § 1-1001.08(r).\n\n(h) In the event that the total number of candidates of one party nominated to an office or group of offices of that party pursuant to § 1-1001.08(a) does not exceed the number of such offices to be filled, the Board may, prior to election day and, notwithstanding the provisions of § 1-1001.08(c), declare the candidates so nominated to be elected without opposition, in which case the fact of their election pursuant to this subsection shall appear for the information of the voters on any ballot prepared by the Board for their party for the election of other candidates in the same election.\n\n(i) Copies of the regulations of the Board with respect to voting shall be made available to prospective voters at each Vote Center.\n\n(j) The Board shall receive the ballots cast and deposit them in a secure place where they shall be safely kept for 22 months. Inspection of such ballots shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Board. Whenever the ballots shall have remained in the custody of the Board for 22 months, and no election contest or other proceeding is pending in which the ballots may be needed as evidence, the Board may destroy such ballots.\n\n(j-1) Upon the conclusion of voting at any Vote Center, the Board shall post a summary count of votes cast at the Vote Center. The summary shall be posted in a conspicuous place that can be seen from the outside of the Vote Center immediately upon completion of voting.\n\n(j-2) Site coordinators shall prepare a summary log that indicates the number of:\n\n(1) Votes cast in a Vote Center;\n\n(2) Persons who have signed in;\n\n(3) Voter-verifiable records that arrived at [a] Vote Center before the polls opened;\n\n(4) Used voter-verifiable records; and\n\n(5) Unused voter-verifiable records.\n\n(1) Each voting system used in an election in the District occurring after January 1, 2012, shall:\n\n(A) Meet or exceed the voting system standards set forth in the Help America Vote Act of 2002, approved October 29, 2002 (116 Stat. 1666; 42 U.S.C. § 15301 et seq.), or be federally certified;\n\n(B) Create a voter-verifiable record of all votes cast;\n\n(C) Be capable without further modification of creating, storing, and exporting an anonymous separate machine record of each voter-verifiable record, showing each choice made by the voter; and\n\n(D) Meet any additional standards established by the Board; provided, that the standards shall not conflict with those set forth in the Help America Vote Act of 2002, approved October 29, 2002 (116 Stat. 1666; 42 U.S.C. § 15301 et seq.).\n\n(2) The voter-verifiable record shall be permanent and capable of being inspected for the purpose of audits and recounts.

      "text": "(a) For the purposes of this section, the term:\n\n(1) “Error rate” means the greatest change in difference between any 2 candidates’ vote totals in an audit sample, comparing the machine result and the tally from the manual audit for a contest, divided by the number of votes (including overvotes and undervotes) audited in that contest in that sample.\n\n(2) “Margin of victory” means the difference between the contest-wide vote totals for the apparent winning candidate with the fewest votes and the apparent losing candidate with the most votes in the machine result, divided by the number of votes cast in the entire contest (including undervotes and overvotes).\n\n(b) After each general and special election, the Board shall conduct a public manual audit of the voter-verifiable records tabulated by the Board.\n\n(1) The Board shall manually audit:\n\n(A) At least 5% of the precincts with precinct-level vote-tabulation machines during the election; and\n\n(B) At least 5% of the voter-verifiable records that are tabulated centrally, including mail-in ballots and special ballots.\n\n(2) Of those voter-verifiable records audited, the Board shall examine no fewer than 3 contests, of which:\n\n(A) At least one shall be a District-wide contest; and\n\n(B) At least 2 shall be a ward-wide race.\n\n(3) The Board may, in its discretion, whether or not by request of a losing candidate, audit additional precincts, voter-verifiable records, or contests; provided, that the Board shall select at least one additional contest not selected pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. The Board shall issue rules describing the criteria that it will use and the procedure for considering requests for additional audits. The Board may also collect fees, set forth by rule, for additional audits conducted under this paragraph.\n\n(d) The precincts audited shall be selected on an entirely random basis; provided, that, within each ward, each precinct in the election shall have an equal chance of being selected. The voter-verifiable records that are tabulated centrally shall also be selected on an entirely random basis. The contests audited shall be selected on an entirely random basis; provided, that, within each category, each contest in the election shall have an equal chance of being selected. The Board shall publicly announce the method by which it intends to randomly select precincts, voter-verifiable records tabulated centrally, and contests, and shall conduct the random selection in such a way as to allow the public to observe and ensure that the selection is random. The selection shall be followed by the audit as soon as is practicable.\n\n(e) The date of the audit shall be announced no later than 3 business days after tabulation has been completed, but no fewer than 24 hours in advance of the audit.\n\n(f) The audit shall be conducted in public view so that members of the public are able to verify that votes are correctly classified and tallied, but are unable to touch ballots and other official materials or to interfere in any way with the manual audit process.\n\n(g) Individuals performing the manual audit shall:\n\n(1) Repealed.\n\n(2) Not at any time before or during the manual audit be informed of the corresponding machine tally results;\n\n(3) Follow the Board’s procedures for hand counting voter-verifiable records, tallying results, noting discrepancies and any missing or damaged voter-verifiable records, and interpreting ambiguous votes where the voter intent may not be clear; and\n\n(4) Make a record of each ambiguous vote, including the nature of the marking error causing the ambiguity and how the vote was interpreted.\n\n(1) If an audit initially reveals a discrepancy between the machine result and the tally from the manual audit that yields an error rate greater than 0.25% or 20% of the margin of victory, whichever is less, and the discrepancy is not attributed to marking errors, a 2nd count shall be conducted.\n\n(2) If the 2nd count confirms the discrepancy described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Board shall also audit another precinct in each ward in which the contest appeared on the ballot, selected at random using the same method previously used to select the precincts, and an additional 5% of all centrally tabulated ballots.\n\n(3) If the additional audit sample described in paragraph (2) of this subsection also reveals a discrepancy between the machine result and the tally from the manual audit that yields an error rate greater than 0.25% or 20% of the margin of victory, whichever is less, the Board shall audit all precincts and centrally tabulated ballots in which the contest was held.\n\n(i) The results derived from the manual audits shall be deemed the true and correct results of the election contests at issue with respect to the votes audited and shall be used in lieu of further counting in any automatic recounts.\n\n(j) The Board shall publish on its website and make available for public inspection a report of results of the manual audit before certification of the official election results. The report shall:\n\n(1) Identify and, when possible, explain any discrepancies between the initial count and the manual tally; and\n\n(2) Describe further investigations to be undertaken or actions to be taken based on the observed discrepancies.\n\n(1) A vendor providing a voting system for use in the District elections shall furnish a bond in the amount of $10,000 to the District.\n\n(2) A comparison of the results compiled by the voting system with the post-election audit described in this section shall show that the results of the electronic voting system differed by no more than 0.25% from the manual count reviewed, not including discrepancies associated with missing or damaged voter-verifiable records and with ambiguous votes.\n\n(3) If a voting system is found to have failed to record votes accurately and in the manner set forth in paragraph (2) of this section, and that the failure is attributable to either the voting system’s design or actions of the vendor, the vendor shall forfeit the bond required by paragraph (1) and pay any costs incurred by the Board directly attributable to the failure.\n\n(4) The vendor shall reimburse the District for the costs of any post-election audit required under subsection (h)(2) and (3) of this section, not including any costs associated for salaried election officials. If the vendor does not reimburse the District for these costs, the vendor shall forfeit the bond required by paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall be liable for the additional costs.",

No act is subject to referendum if it has taken effect according to the provisions of § 1-206.02(c).\n\n(3) The proposer may not begin circulating an initiative or referendum petition until the Board has certified pursuant to subsection (f) of this section that such petition is in its final form.\n\n(1) Upon submission of an initiative or referendum petition by the proposer to the Board, the Board shall refuse to accept the petition upon any of the following grounds:\n\n(A) The petition is not in the proper form established in subsection (g) of this section;\n\n(B) The time limitation established in subsection (j) of this section within which the petition may be circulated and submitted to the Board has expired;\n\n(C) The petition on its face clearly bears an insufficient number of signatures;\n\n(D) The petition sheets do not have attached to them the statements of the circulators as provided in subsection (h) of this section; or\n\n(E) The petition was circulated by persons who were not qualified petition circulators at the time of circulation.\n\n(2) In the case of refusal to accept a petition, the Board shall endorse on the petition the words “submitted but not accepted” and the date, and retain the petition pending appeal.

The Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall expedite the consideration of the matter. If the Superior Court of the District of Columbia determines that the petition is legal in form and apparently meets the requirement for signatures, both as to number and as to ward distribution, prescribed in subsection (i) of this section, and was submitted within the time limitations established in subsection (j) of this section, and has attached to the petition the proper statements of the circulators prescribed in subsection (h) of this section, it shall issue an order requiring the Board to accept the petition as of the date of submission for filing. Should the Superior Court of the District of Columbia hold in favor of the proposer, it may award court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the proposer.\n\n(m) Upon submission of a referendum petition to the Board, the Board shall notify the appropriate custodian of the act of the Council of the District of Columbia which is the subject of the referendum (either the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives) as provided in §§ 1-204.04 and 1-204.46 and the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall, as appropriate, return such act or part or parts of such act to the Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia. No further action may be taken upon such act until after a referendum election is held. If, however, after the counting and validation procedure for signatures, which takes place pursuant to subsection (o) of this section, the referendum measure fails to meet the percentage and distribution requirements for signatures established in subsection (i) of this section, the act which was the subject of the referendum shall be again transmitted to the Congress for any remaining period of review as provided in § 1-206.02(c).\n\n(n) When the Board accepts an initiative or referendum petition, whether in the normal course or at the direction of a court, the Board may detach, in the presence of the person submitting the petition or his or her designated representative, if he or she desires to be present, the sheets containing the signatures, and cause all of them to be firmly attached to 1 or more printed copies of the proposed initiative or referendum measure in such books or volumes as will be most convenient for counting, canvassing, and validating names and signatures.\n\n(1) After acceptance of an initiative or referendum petition, the Board shall certify, within 30 calendar days after such petition has been accepted, whether or not the number of valid signatures on the initiative or referendum petition meets the qualifying percentage and ward distribution requirements established in subsection (i) of this section, and whether or not the necessary number of names and signatures of registered qualified electors of the District of Columbia, properly distributed by wards, appear on the initiative or referendum petition. This certification may be by a bona fide random and statistical sampling method. If the Board finds that the same person has signed a petition for the same initiative or referendum measure more than once, it shall count only 1 signature of such person. If a person who signs a petition is found to be a qualified registered elector in a ward other than that which was indicated on the petition sheet, such person shall be counted from the correct ward in determining whether or not an initiative or referendum measure qualifies for the ballot. Two persons representing the proposer(s) may be present during the counting and validation procedures. Should a political committee or committees exist in opposition to a particular proposed initiative or referendum measure, 2 persons representing such committee or committees may be present during the counting and validation procedures. The Board shall post, by making available for public inspection, petitions for initiatives or referenda, or facsimiles thereof, in the office of the Board, for 10 days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, beginning on the 3rd day after the petitions are filed. Any qualified elector may, within such 10-day period, challenge the validity of any petition, by a written statement duly signed by the challenger and filed with the Board, specifying concisely the alleged defects in such petition. The provisions of § 1-1001.08(o)(2) shall be applicable to such challenge. The Board may issue supplemental rules concerning the challenge of such petitions.\n\n(2) For the purpose of verifying a signature on any petition filed pursuant to this section, the Board shall first determine that the address on the petition is the same as the residence shown on the signer’s voter registration record. If the address is different, the signature shall not be counted as valid unless the Board’s records show that the person was registered to vote from the address listed on the petition at the time the person signed the petition.\n\n(1) After determining that the number and validity of signatures on the initiative or referendum petition meet the qualification standards established under this section, the Board shall certify the sufficiency of the initiative or referendum petition and shall certify that the initiative or referendum measure will appear on the ballot. The Board shall conduct an election on an initiative measure at the next primary, general, or city-wide special election held at least 90 days after the date on which the measure has been certified as qualified to appear on the ballot. The Board shall conduct an election on a referendum measure within 114 days after the date the measure has been certified as qualified to appear on the ballot. In the case of a referendum measure, if a previously scheduled general, primary, or special election will occur between 54 and 114 days after the date the measure has been certified as qualified to appear on the ballot, the Board may present the referendum measure at that election.\n\n(2) The Board shall publish the established legislative text of an initiative or referendum measure in no less than 2 newspapers of general circulation in the District of Columbia within 30 calendar days after the date upon which the Board certifies, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, that the measure has qualified for appearance on an election ballot.\n\n(1) Upon qualification of an initiative measure, the Board shall place on the ballot the serial number of the initiative and its short title and summary statement in substantially the following form:\n\n(2) Upon qualification of a referendum measure, the Board shall place on the ballot the serial number of the referendum measure and its short title and summary statement in substantially the following form:\n\n(A) If the referendum concerns whether the registered voters of the District of Columbia approve or reject the act, then the ballot shall state:\n\n(B) If the referendum concerns part or parts of an act, then the ballot shall state:\n\n(1) An initiative measure which has been ratified by a majority of the registered qualified electors voting on the measure shall not take effect until the end of the 30-day congressional review period (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, and any day on which neither House is in session because of an adjournment sine die, a recess of more than 3 days or an adjournment of more than 3 days) beginning on the day such measure is transmitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, and then only if during such 30-day period both Houses of Congress do not adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving such initiated act.

To view the text of this section after the expiration of all emergency and temporary legislation affecting this section, click this link: Permanent Version.*\n\n(a) The provisions of this section shall govern the recall of all elected officers of the District of Columbia except the Delegate to the Congress from the District of Columbia.\n\n(1) Any registered qualified elector or electors desiring to initiate the recall of an elected officer shall file a notice of intention to recall that officer with the Board, which contains the following information:\n\n(A) The name and title of the elected officer sought to be recalled;\n\n(B) A statement not to exceed 200 words in length, giving the reasons for the proposed recall;\n\n(C) The name and address of the proposer of the recall; and\n\n(D) An affidavit that each proposer is:\n\n(i) A registered qualified elector in the election ward of the elected officer whose recall is sought, if that officer was elected to represent a ward;\n\n(ii) A registered qualified elector in the District of Columbia, if the officer whose recall is sought was elected at-large; or\n\n(iii) A registered qualified elector in the single-member district of an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner whose recall is sought.\n\n(2) A separate notice of intention shall be filed for each officer sought to be recalled.\n\n(1) No recall proceedings shall be initiated for an elected officer during the 1st 365 days nor during the last 365 days of the elected officer's term of office.\n\n(2) The recall process for an elected officer may not be initiated within 365 days after a recall election has been determined in the elected officer's favor.\n\n(3) In the case of an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, no recall proceedings shall be initiated during the first 6 months or the last 6 months of the Commissioner’s term of office, nor within 6 months after a recall election has been decided in favor of the Commissioner.\n\n(1) The Board shall serve, in person or by certified mail, the notice of intention to recall to the elected officer sought to be recalled within 5 calendar days.\n\n(2) The elected officer sought to be recalled may file with the Board, within 10 calendar days after the filing of the notice of intention to recall, a response of not more than 200 words, to the statement of the proposer of recall. If an answer is filed, the Board shall serve immediately a copy of that response to the proposer named in the notice of intention to recall.\n\n(3) The statement contained in the notice of intention to recall and the elected officer’s response are intended solely for the information of the voters. No insufficiency in form or substance of such statement shall affect the validity of the election proceedings.\n\n(e) Upon filing with the Board the notice of intention of recall and the elected officer’s response, the Board shall prepare and provide to the proponent an original petition form which the proposer shall formally adopt as the proponent's own form. The proponent shall print from the original blank petition sheets on paper of good writing quality or shall utilize the mobile application made available under § 1-1001.05(a)(19). Each recall petition sheet shall be double sided and consist of numbered lines for 20 names and signatures with residence address (street numbers), and, where applicable, the ward numbers. Each petition sheet shall have printed on it, and each mobile application shall electronically display, the following information:\n\n(1) A warning statement that declares that only duly registered electors of the District of Columbia may sign the petition;\n\n(2) The name of the elected officer sought to be recalled and the office which the elected officer holds;\n\n(3) A statement that requests that the Board hold a recall election in a manner prescribed in §§ 1-204.111 to 1-204.115;\n\n(4) The name and address of the proposer or proposers of the recall; and\n\n(5) The statement of grounds for the recall and the response of the officer sought to be recalled, if any. If the officer sought to be recalled has not responded, the petition shall so state.\n\n(f) Each petition sheet or sheets for recall shall have attached to it, at the time of submission to the Board, a statement made under penalties of perjury, in a form determined by the Board signed by the circulator of that petition which contains the following:\n\n(1) The printed name of the circulator;\n\n(2) The residence address of the circulator giving the street and number;\n\n(3) That the circulator of the petition form was in the presence of each person when the appended signature was written;\n\n(3A) That the circulator of the petition sheet has not written, altered, corrected, clarified, or obscured information on the petition about the signer of the petition after the signer affixed their signature to the petition;\n\n(4) That according to the best information available to the circulator, each signature is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be;\n\n(5) That the circulator of the recall petition was a qualified petition circulator at the time of circulation; and\n\n(6) The dates between which all the signatures to the petition were obtained.\n\n(f-1) No person other than the petition signer may write, alter, correct, or clarify, on a petition sheet for a recall petition unless the signer requests assistance in writing, altering, correcting, or clarifying on the petition, any information about the petition signer before the signer affixes their signature. The use of correction fluid or tape is prohibited.\n\n(g) The proposer of a recall shall have 180 days or, in the case of a proposed recall of an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, 60 days, beginning on the date when the proponent of the recall formally adopts the original petition form as the proponent's own form pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, to circulate the recall petition and file the petition with the Board.\n\n(1) A recall petition for an elected officer from a ward shall include the valid signatures of 10 percent of the registered qualified electors of the ward from which the officer was elected. The 10 percent shall be computed from the total number of the qualified registered electors from such ward according to the latest official count of the registered qualified electors made by the Board 30 days prior to the date of initial submission to the Board of the notice of intention to recall.\n\n(2) A recall petition for an at-large elected official shall contain the signatures of registered qualified electors in number equal to 10 percent of the registered qualified electors in the District of Columbia: Provided, that the total signatures submitted include 10 percent of the registered electors in each of 5 or more of the 8 wards. The 10 percent shall be computed from the total number of registered qualified electors from the District of Columbia according to the same procedures established in paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n\n(3) A recall petition for an elected officer from a single-member district shall include the valid signatures of 10% of the registered qualified electors of the single-member district from which the officer was elected, except when the elected officer has missed all regularly scheduled meetings of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission of which the single-member district is a part for at least a three-month period, in which case the recall petition must only include the valid signatures of 5% of the registered qualified electors of the single-member district from which the officer was elected. The 5% or 10% shall be computed from the total number of registered qualified electors from the single-member district in accordance with the same procedures established in paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n\n(i) Upon the submission of a recall petition by the proposer to the Board, the Board shall refuse to accept the petition upon any of the following grounds:\n\n(1) Except in the case of a recall petition for an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, the financial disclosure statement of the proposer has not been filed pursuant to §§ 1-1163.07 and 1-1163.09;\n\n(2) The petition is not the proper form established in subsection (e) of this section;\n\n(3) The restrictions for initiating the recall process established in subsection (c) of this section were not observed;\n\n(4) The time limitation established in subsection (g) of this section within which the recall petition may be circulated and submitted to the Board has expired;\n\n(5) The petition clearly bears on its face an insufficient number of signatures to qualify for the ballot; or\n\n(6) The petition was circulated by persons who were not qualified petition circulators at the time of circulation.\n\n(1) If the Board refuses to accept the recall petition when submitted to it, the proposer submitting such petition to the Board may appeal, within 10 days after the Board’s refusal, to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for a writ in the nature of mandamus to compel the Board to accept such recall petition. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall expedite the consideration of the matter. If the Superior Court of the District of Columbia determines that the petition is legal in form and apparently meets the requirements established under this section, it shall issue an order requiring the Board to accept the petition as of the date of submission.\n\n(2) Should the Superior Court of the District of Columbia hold in favor of the proposer, it may award court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to the proposer.\n\n(1) After the acceptance of a recall petition, the Board shall certify, within 30 calendar days after such petition has been filed, whether or not the number of valid signatures on the recall petition meets the qualifying percentage and ward distribution requirements established in subsection (h) of this section and whether or not the necessary number of signatures of registered qualified electors of the District of Columbia, properly distributed by wards, appears on the petition. This certification may be made by a bona fide random and statistical sampling method. In a case in which an officer elected from a ward is sought to be recalled, if a person who signs a recall petition for that elected officer is found not to be a registered qualified elector in the ward indicated on the petition, that name and signature shall not be counted toward determining whether or not the recall measure qualifies. In a case in which an officer elected at-large is sought to be recalled, if a person who signs a recall petition for that elected officer is found to be a registered qualified elector in a ward other than what was indicated on the petition sheet, such person shall be counted from the correct ward in determining whether or not a recall measure for an at-large elected officer qualified. In a case in which an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner is sought to be recalled, if a person who signs a petition to recall that Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner is found not to be a registered qualified elector in the single-member district indicated on the petition, the person’s name and signature shall not be counted toward determining whether or not the recall measure qualifies. If the Board finds that the same person has signed a petition for the same recall measure more than once, it shall count only 1 signature of such person. Two persons representing the petitioner(s) seeking the recall and 2 persons representing the elected officer sought to be recalled may be present to observe during the counting and validating procedure.\n\n(2) The Board shall post, within 3 calendar days after the acceptance of a recall petition, whether in the normal course or at the direction of a court, by making available for public inspection in the office of the Board, the petition for the recall measure or facsimile. Any registered qualified elector, during a 10-day period (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, except that with respect to a petition to recall a member of an Advisory Neighborhood Commission SMD, the 10-day period shall not include Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays), beginning on the day the recall petition was posted by the Board, may challenge the validity of such petition by a written statement duly signed by the challenger and filed with the Board, specifying concisely the alleged defects in the petition. The provisions of § 1-1001.08(o)(2) shall be applicable to a challenge and the Board may establish any necessary rules and regulations consistent that concerns the process of the challenge.\n\n(3) For the purpose of verifying a signature on any petition filed pursuant to this section, the Board shall first determine that the address on the petition is the same as the residence shown on the signer’s voter registration record. If the address is different, the signature shall not be counted as valid unless the Board’s records show that the person was registered to vote from the address listed on the petition at the time the person signed the petition.\n\n(1) After determining that the number and validity of signatures in the recall petition meet the requirements established in this section, and that determination is upheld if challenged, the Board shall certify the sufficiency of such recall petition. The Board shall conduct a special election to determine whether the elected officer who is the subject of the recall shall be removed from office within 114 days after the date the petition to recall has been certified as to its sufficiency. If a previously scheduled general, primary, or special election will occur between 54 and 114 days after the date the petition to recall has been certified as to its sufficiency, the Board may present the recall measure at that election.\n\n(2) If the elected officer who is the subject of the recall represents a particular ward, the recall election shall be conducted only in that ward.\n\n(3) If the elected officer who is the subject of the recall is an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, the recall election shall be conducted only in that single-member district. A special election called to consider the recall of an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner shall not be considered an election for the purposes of § 1-1001.16(p).\n\n(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter for a special election called to consider the recall of an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, the Board shall determine the number and location of ballot drop boxes and Vote Centers used.\n\n(m) The Board shall place the recall measure on the ballot in substantially the following form:\n\n(n) Based on the results of the special election held to decide the outcome of the recall measure, the elected officer sought to be recalled shall be removed from that office: Provided, that a majority of the qualified electors voting in the recall election vote to remove the elected officer. The vacancy, as created by the removal, shall be filled in the same manner as other vacancies, as provided in §§ 1-204.01(b)(3) and (d), 1-204.21(c)(2), 1-309.06(d), and 1-1001.10.",

An electronic-mail address provided by a covered voter, or by any other District voter, may not be made available to the public or any individual or organization other than an authorized agent of the Board and is exempt from disclosure under subchapter II of Chapter 5 of Title 2. The address may be used only for official communication with the voter about the voting process, including transmitting military-overseas ballots and election materials if the voter has requested electronic transmission, and verifying the voter’s mailing address and physical location. The request for an electronic-mail address must describe the purposes for which the electronic-mail address may be used and include a statement that any other use or disclosure of the electronic-mail address is prohibited.\n\n(b) A covered voter who provides an electronic-mail address may request that the voter’s application for a military-overseas ballot be considered a standing request for electronic delivery of a ballot for all elections held through December 31 of the year of the date of the application or another shorter period that the voter specifies. The Board shall provide a military-overseas ballot to a voter who makes a standing request for each election to which the request is applicable. A covered voter who is entitled to receive a military-overseas ballot for a primary election under this subsection is entitled to receive a military-overseas ballot for the general election.",
