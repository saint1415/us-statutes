      "text": "The Mayor is authorized to enter into and execute on behalf of the District a compact with any state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:\n\n(a) The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\n\n(b) It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states, to:\n\n(1) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;\n\n(2) Ensure that the public-safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;\n\n(3) Return juveniles who have run away, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;\n\n(4) Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;\n\n(5) Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;\n\n(6) Equitably allocate the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compacting states;\n\n(7) Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or other criminal or juvenile justice agency that has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;\n\n(8) Insure that immediate notice is provided to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or relocate across state lines;\n\n(9) Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;\n\n(10) Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches, and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;\n\n(11) Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;\n\n(12) Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in this activity; and\n\n(13) Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles, particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.\n\n(c) It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission, created in Article III of this compact, are the formation of public policies and, therefore, are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.\n\nII As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction, the term:\n\n(1) “Bylaws” means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling its actions or conduct.\n\n(2) “Compact administrator” means the individual in each compacting state, appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact, responsible for the administration and management of the state’s supervision and transfer of juveniles subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission, and policies adopted by the State Council under this compact.\n\n(3) “Compacting state” means any state that has enacted enabling legislation for this compact.\n\n(4) “Commissioner” means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to Article III of this compact.\n\n(5) “Court” means any court having jurisdiction over delinquent, neglected, or dependent children.\n\n(6) “Deputy compact administrator” means the individual, if any, in each compacting state appointed to act on behalf of a compact administrator pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state’s supervision and transfer of juveniles, subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission, and policies adopted by the State Council under this compact.\n\n(7) “Interstate Commission” means the Interstate Commission for Juveniles created by Article III of this compact.\n\n(8) “Juvenile” means any person defined as a juvenile in any member state or by the rules of the Interstate Commission, including a(n):\n\n(A) “Accused delinquent” — a person charged with an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n\n(B) “Adjudicated delinquent” — a person found to have committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n\n(C) “Accused status offender” — a person charged with an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult;\n\n(D) “Adjudicated status offender” — a person found to have committed an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult; and\n\n(E) “Non-offender” — a person in need of supervision who has not been accused or adjudicated a status offender or delinquent.\n\n(9) “Non-compacting state” means any state that has not enacted enabling legislation for this compact.\n\n(10) “Probation or parole” means any kind of supervision or conditional release of juveniles authorized under the laws of the compacting states.\n\n(11) “Rule” means a written statement by the Interstate Commission promulgated pursuant to Article VI of this compact that is of general applicability, implements, interprets, or prescribes a policy or provision of this compact, or an organizational, procedural, or practice requirement of the Interstate Commission, and has the force and effect of statutory law in a compacting state, and includes the amendment, repeal, or suspension of an existing rule.\n\n(12) “State” means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas Islands.\n\n(a) The compacting states hereby create the Interstate Commission for Juveniles.

The Interstate Commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers, and duties set forth in this compact and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact.\n\n(b) The Interstate Commission shall consist of commissioners appointed by the appropriate appointing authority in each state pursuant to the rules and requirements of each compacting state, in consultation with the State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision (“State Council”). The commissioner shall be the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator, or designee from that state who shall serve on the Interstate Commission in such capacity under or pursuant to the applicable law of the compacting state.\n\n(c) In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the Interstate Commission shall include individuals who are not commissioners but who are members of interested organizations. Such non-commissioner members shall include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general, Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, juvenile justice and juvenile corrections officials, and crime victims.

The executive committee, managed by an executive director and the Interstate Commission staff, shall;\n\n(1) Oversee the day-to-day activities of the administration of the compact;\n\n(2) Administer enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws, and rules; and\n\n(3) Perform other duties as directed by the Interstate Commission or as set forth in the bylaws.\n\n(g) Each member of the Interstate Commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission. A member shall vote in person and shall not delegate a vote to another compacting state. However, a commissioner, in consultation with the State Council, shall appoint another authorized representative in the absence of the commissioner from that state to cast a vote on behalf of the compacting state at a specified meeting. The bylaws may provide for members’ participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication.\n\n(h) The Interstate Commission’s bylaws shall establish conditions and procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official record to the extent it would adversely affect personal-privacy rights or proprietary interests.\n\n(i) Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact.

The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes, which shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting, and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons for the actions, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll-call vote (reflected in the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in the minutes.\n\n(k) The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of juveniles as directed through its rules, which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange, and reporting requirements. The methods of data collection, exchange, and reporting shall insofar as is reasonably possible conform to up-to-date technology and coordinate its information functions with the appropriate repository of records.\n\nIV The Interstate Commission shall have the power and duty to:\n\n(1) Provide for dispute resolution among the compacting states;\n\n(2) Promulgate rules to effect the purposes and obligations enumerated in the compact, which shall have the force and effect of statutory law and shall be binding in the compacting states to the extent and in the manner provided in this compact;\n\n(3) Oversee, supervise, and coordinate the interstate movement of juveniles, subject to the terms of this compact and any bylaws adopted and rules promulgated by the Interstate Commission;\n\n(4) Enforce compliance with the compact provisions, the rules promulgated by the Interstate Commission, and the bylaws, using all necessary and proper means, including, but not limited to, the use of the judicial process;\n\n(5) Establish and maintain offices, which shall be located within one or more of the compacting states;\n\n(6) Purchase and maintain insurance and bonds;\n\n(7) Borrow, accept, hire, or contract for services of personnel;\n\n(8) Establish and appoint committees and hire staff that it considers necessary to carry out its functions, including, but not limited to, an executive committee as required by Article III(f), which shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission in carrying out the powers and duties set forth in this article;\n\n(9) Elect or appoint officers, attorneys, employees, agents, and consultants, determine their qualifications, fix their compensation, and define their duties;\n\n(10) Establish personnel policies and programs relating to, inter alia, conflicts of interest, rates of compensation, and qualifications of personnel;\n\n(11) Accept and utilize and dispose of donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services;\n\n(12) Lease, purchase, accept contributions or donations of, or otherwise to own, hold, improve, or use any property, real, personal, or mixed;\n\n(13) Sell, convey, mortgage, pledge, lease, exchange, abandon, or otherwise dispose of any property, real, personal, or mixed;\n\n(14) Establish a budget and make expenditures and levy dues as provided in Article VIII of this compact;\n\n(15) Sue and be sued;\n\n(16) Adopt a seal and bylaws to govern its management and operation;\n\n(17) Report annually to the legislatures, governors, judiciary, and State Councils of the compacting states concerning its activities during the preceding year and any recommendations that it adopted;\n\n(18) Coordinate education, training, and public awareness regarding the interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in this activity;\n\n(19) Establish uniform standards for the reporting, collecting, and exchanging of data;\n\n(20) Maintain its corporate books and records in accordance with the bylaws; and\n\n(21) Perform any other functions as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this compact.\n\n(a) Bylaws — The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members present and voting, within 12 months after the first Interstate Commission meeting, adopt bylaws to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the compact, including, but not limited to:\n\n(1) Establishing the fiscal year of the Interstate Commission;\n\n(2) Establishing an executive committee and any other committees as may be necessary;\n\n(3) Providing for the establishment of committees governing any general or specific delegation of any authority or function of the Interstate Commission;\n\n(4) Providing reasonable procedures for calling and conducting meetings of the Interstate Commission and ensuring reasonable notice of each meeting;\n\n(5) Establishing the titles and responsibilities of the officers of the Interstate Commission;\n\n(6) Providing a mechanism for concluding the operations of the Interstate Commission and the return of any surplus funds that may exist upon the termination of the compact after the payment or reserving of all of its debts and obligations;\n\n(7) Providing start-up rules for the initial administration of the compact; and\n\n(8) Establishing standards and procedures for compliance and technical assistance in carrying out the compact.\n\n(b) Officers and staff — (1) The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairperson and a vice chairperson, each of whom shall have the authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws.

The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated pursuant to this compact shall be received by all the judges, public officers, commissions, and departments of the state government as evidence of the authorized statute and administrative rules. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules.

The aggregate annual assessment shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, which shall take into consideration the population of each compacting state and the volume of interstate movement of juveniles in each compacting state. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule, which shall be binding on all compacting states, that governs the assessment.\n\n(c) The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligation of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the obligation or pledge the credit of any compacting state except by and with the authority of the compacting state.\n\n(d) The Interstate Commission shall keep an accurate account of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant. The report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.\n\nIX “Each member state shall create a State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision. While each state may determine the membership of its own State Council, its membership must include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government and a victims’ group, and include the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator, or designee. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator or deputy compact administrator. Each State Council will advise and may exercise oversight and advocacy concerning that state’s participation in Interstate Commission activities and duties as determined by that state, including, but not limited to, development of a policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.\n\n(a) Any state as defined in Article II(12) is eligible to become a compacting state.\n\n(b) The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than 35 states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2004, or enactment into law by the 35th state. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of non-member states, or their designees, shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states.\n\n(c) The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the compacting states until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.\n\n(a) Withdrawal — (1) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law.\n\n(2) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.\n\n(3) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.

The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated upon the effective date of termination.\n\n(5) Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the State Council of the termination.\n\n(6) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n(7) The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n(8) Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.\n\n(c) Judicial enforcement — The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its rules, or bylaws against any compacting state in default.
