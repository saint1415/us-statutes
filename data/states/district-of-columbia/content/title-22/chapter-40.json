If the Court determines that a hearing is necessary to decide the issue or if the interests of justice otherwise require, the Court shall appoint counsel for the person if he or she is not represented by counsel and meets the financial criteria for the appointment of counsel.\n\n(2) If the Court concludes that the person is required to register under this chapter, the Court shall follow the procedures set forth in § 22-4003(a) and (b). If the Court concludes that the person is not required to register under this chapter or is not required to register for life under this chapter, the Court shall enter an order certifying that the person is not required to register under this chapter or is not required to register for life under this chapter and shall provide the Agency with a copy of that order.",
