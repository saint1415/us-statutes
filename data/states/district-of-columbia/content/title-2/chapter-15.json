and\n\n(D) Identifying additional resources from agencies that should, where appropriate, be available to provide support for individual CI plans.\n\n(c) By December 31, 2009, the Joint Working Group shall expand capacity of Critical Incident and Targeted Youth Outreach Teams through the following measures:\n\n(1) Based on the CI capacity assessment, described in subsection (b) of this section, estimate what the current gap is between capacities and need;\n\n(2) Assess the existing capacity of CCCYVP partners to provide targeted outreach to the highest-risk youth;\n\n(3) Develop a plan to expand CI and targeted outreach that realistically reflects time necessary for recruitment and orientation of new staff; and\n\n(4) Prepare a cost estimate for the short-term expansion plan, and a funding proposal for its implementation.",
