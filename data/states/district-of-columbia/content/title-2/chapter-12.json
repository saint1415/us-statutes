      "text": "(a) The Council finds that:\n\n(1) There exists in the District of Columbia a substantial problem of chronic unemployment and underemployment;\n\n(2) In the last 2 decades, growth in employment, new business development, and commercial development in the District of Columbia has failed to keep pace with employment growth and commercial expansion in neighboring jurisdictions;\n\n(3) During the same period, the District has experienced a substantial loss in retail businesses and other commercial enterprises which contributed significantly to local employment and the city’s tax base;\n\n(4) Expansion of the tax base in the District of Columbia has, in recent years, lagged significantly behind the rate of inflation and the rate of increase in District of Columbia government expenditures;\n\n(5) Substantial expansion of the tax base is necessary to help avert future governmental fiscal crises, prevent ever-increasing individual business and professional tax levels, and assure provision of necessary public services;\n\n(6) The District of Columbia government lacks an organized capacity or comprehensive strategy to assess its economic needs, encourage business retention, attract commercial enterprises, or otherwise promote and stimulate economic growth;\n\n(7) The absence of such a capacity and strategy has been a significant factor in the District’s inability to compete with neighboring jurisdictions in the retention of existing businesses and the attraction of new enterprises;\n\n(8) Direct and continuing active participation of all levels of the business community is essential to carrying out the objectives of this subchapter.\n\n(b) The purposes of this subchapter are:\n\n(1) To establish an office with ongoing responsibility to assess the economic needs of the City; stimulate new employment opportunities; assist existing businesses; promote the City as a location for businesses and investment to priority City locations in accordance with the City’s comprehensive plan and its economic development objectives; and\n\n(2) To centralize the economic development functions in the District of Columbia government in a single agency devoted solely to these tasks.",

Any recovery of funds from a special account shall be only by payment from the collection agent to the District.\n\n(1) The collection agent shall make a payment to the District equal to the amount of any tax refund associated with such special account that the District documents is required pursuant to District law; provided, that to the extent that a special account lacks the funds needed to make a payment pursuant to this paragraph, the collection agent shall make said payment to the District as soon as sufficient funds are deposited into such special account; provided further, that a BID corporation shall have standing to participate in any administrative proceeding or to intervene in any judicial proceeding for the refund of BID taxes associated with such BID.\n\n(2) The collection agent shall make a monthly accounting to each BID of any payments to the District from the special account associated with that BID.\n\n(j) Each month, prior to the 5th day of the month, the collection agent shall make a payment to the BID associated with the special account, which payment shall consist of all of the funds in such account as of the end of the final day of the preceding calendar month; provided, that the collection agent shall first provide for the payment of costs pursuant to subsection (i) of this section; provided further, that the collection agent shall withhold a portion of such funds, not to exceed 2% of the total annual BID taxes associated with such account when the BID taxes are based on assessed value or 1/2 of 1% of the total annual BID taxes associated with such account when BID taxes are based on square footage or per building, that the Treasurer of the District finds is needed as a reserve fund to pay any tax refund that may be required pursuant to District law.\n\n(k) Each month, the collection agent shall provide a statement regarding the transactions in such special account to the Treasurer of the District and to the BID associated with such special account.\n\n(1) No funds may be withdrawn from a special account established pursuant to this section except as specifically provided in subsections (i) and (j) of this section.
