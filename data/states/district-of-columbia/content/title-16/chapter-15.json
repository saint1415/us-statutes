      "text": "(a) When a person detains possession of real property without right, or after his right to possession has ceased, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, on complaint under oath verified by the person aggrieved by the detention, or by his agent or attorney having knowledge of the facts, may issue a summons in English and Spanish to the party complained of to appear and show cause why judgment should not be given against him for the restitution of possession.\n\n(b) A person aggrieved shall not file a complaint seeking restitution of possession pursuant to this section for nonpayment of rent in an amount less than $600. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the person aggrieved from filing a complaint to recover the amount owed.\n\n(1) A person aggrieved shall not file a complaint seeking restitution of possession pursuant to this section without a valid rental registration or claim of exemption pursuant to § 42-3502.05, and a current license for rental housing issued pursuant to § 47-2828(c)(1), as certified at the time of filing and documented at the initial hearing.\n\n(2) The Court may waive the requirements for a current license for rental housing in this subsection if the person aggrieved can demonstrate that they were unable to obtain or renew a current rental housing license due to extenuating circumstances, including a medical emergency, agency delay, or a circumstance in which a tenant or occupant denies permission for a required pre-license inspection or required repairs.\n\n(3) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to complaints involving subtenants.\n\n(d) At the initial hearing for any complaint for possession, if the complaint does not allege sufficient facts or the person aggrieved has not produced sufficient documentation to meet all requirements under District law, the Court may, in its discretion when weighing the prejudice to all parties, dismiss the complaint or provide leave for the complainant to correct any deficiencies.\n\n(e) Subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply to complaints involving commercial tenants.",

The court shall inform the defendant of the possible consequences of knowingly asserting baseless defenses.\n\n(2) The court shall issue a preliminary protective order for the monthly rent amount required by the rent ledger, lease, rental agreement, or rental agreement addenda after the initial motion and shall schedule a hearing thereafter on any alleged current violations of the housing code or other defenses that may merit an adjustment to the preliminary protective order. In determining the amount of the preliminary protective order, the court is not required to conduct an evidentiary proceeding, but may in its discretion consider evidence that the parties are prepared to present, including whether there is any dispute regarding the plaintiff's assertion of the monthly rent amount.",
