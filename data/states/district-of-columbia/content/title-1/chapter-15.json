The Plan would establish the Office of Risk Management (Office), state the purpose of the Office, state the duties of the Chief Risk Officer and state the authority and functions of the Office.\n\n2. For the purpose of the Plan, unless otherwise required by the context the term:\n\n(1) \"Agency risk management representative\" means the individual in each agency whose duties include exposure identification and assessment and risk control strategy coordination at the agency level on behalf of the agency director. Where this individual obtains the necessary professional training as specified by the Chief Risk Officer they may be referred to as the \"Agency Risk Manager\".\n\n(2) \"Chief Risk Officer\" means the head of the Office of Risk Management.\n\n(3) \"Claims management\" means the process used to administer and gather data concerning any notice to the District government of any alleged wrongful acts, whether tortuous, contractual, or equitable in nature, for which the District, its officers, agents, or employees are allegedly responsible, including, but not limited to, claims arising from unresolved civil, administrative, or judicial litigation.\n\n(4) \"Cost of risk\" means the cost of actual losses sustained, administrative costs of the risk management program, costs of funding losses, costs of risk control efforts and other outside service costs.\n\n(5) \"District government facility\" means a building either owned, controlled, occupied, or leased by the District government.\n\n(6) \"Office of Risk Management\" means the office (Office) established by the Plan.\n\n(7) \"Risk assessment\" means the process for conducting reviews and investigations of District operations, activities and facilities to identify and measure risk exposures.\n\n(8) \"Risk control\" means the effective minimization of the probability, frequency, and severity of accidental losses on a pre-loss and post-loss basis through the selection and implementation of mitigation strategies, a proactive compliance monitoring program for safety and security, and contingency planning for District government operational interruptions or emergencies.\n\n(9) \"Risk exposure\" means exposure to issues or matters which have potential to create financial, reputational, efficiency and organizational losses, including losses from any alleged wrongful acts, whether tortuous, contractual, or equitable in nature, for which the District, its officers, agents, or employees are allegedly responsible, including, but not limited to, claims arising from unresolved civil, administrative, or judicial litigation.\n\n(10) \"Risk financing\" means claims management and the professional anticipation and planned funding of loss payments resulting from adjudication or settlement of claims.\n\n(11) \"Risk funding\" means the selection and application of specific techniques to meet the financial obligation caused by unexpected losses including retention such as self-insurance, or transfer such as purchasing insurance or other contractual transfer, and the oversight of those techniques.\n\n(12) \"Risk identification and analysis\" means the systematic identification, measurement, analysis, and documentation of the District government's exposure to risk.\n\n(13) \"Risk management\" means the continuous process of risk identification and analysis, employing effective risk assessment, risk control, risk financing, and risk funding strategies to minimize and control risk exposure and actual and potential losses.\n\n(14) \"Risk map\" means a schematic drawing that illustrates the prioritization of risk exposures in terms of anticipated frequency and severity of occurrence suggesting organizational hierarchy and priority of strategies for risk management.\n\n(a) There is created within the executive branch of the government of the District of Columbia the Office of Risk Management (Office) with direct oversight by the City Administrator.\n\n(b) The head of the Office shall be the Chief Risk Officer, who shall be appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of the Council pursuant to section 422 (1) of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 790; D.C.

To be eligible for appointment as the Chief Risk Officer a person shall have demonstrated, through his or her knowledge and experience, the ability to administer a public risk management office of the size and complexity of the Office established by the Plan.\n\n(c) The Chief Risk Officer shall be paid at an annual rate, determined by the Mayor. To the extent that the annual salary rate exceeds that set forth in the District of Columbia Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978 (CMPA), the proposed salary shall be forwarded to the Council and set forth in a pay resolution approved by the Council as required by the CMPA.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding any delegation of the authority to settle claims that the Mayor may delegate to the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Risk Officer may redelegate any or all of such settlement authority to the Corporation Counsel [now Attorney General for the District of Columbia].\n\n(a) The purpose of the Office is to provide risk management direction, guidance and support to District government agencies so that they can minimize the total cost of risk, resulting in improved government operations and enhanced service delivery. This will be accomplished by integrating agency programs of systematic risk identification and analysis, selecting and implementing appropriate risk control strategies, and prudently financing anticipated and incurred losses, into a District government integrated risk management program.
