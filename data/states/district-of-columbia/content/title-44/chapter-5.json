Instead of issuing a full-year license to a new facility or agency, the Mayor may issue a provisional license under § 44-506 pending satisfactory completion of additional, follow-up inspections.\n\n(b) After initial licensure the Mayor shall conduct an on-site inspection as a precondition to licensure renewal, except that the Mayor may accept accreditation by a private accrediting body, federal certification for participation in a health-insurance or medical assistance program, or federal qualification of a health maintenance organization as evidence of, and in lieu of inspecting for, compliance with any or all of the provisions of this subchapter and rules adopted pursuant to this subchapter that incorporate or are substantially similar to applicable standards or conditions of participation established by that body or the federal government.

In conducting an inspection, the official shall make every effort not to disrupt the normal operations of the facility or agency and its staff.\n\n(1) If a facility or agency loses private accreditation or federal certification, it shall give the Mayor written notice of the loss within 5 calendar days. If in such a case accreditation or certification was accepted in lieu of an inspection under subsection (b) of this section, the Mayor shall immediately upon notification:\n\n(A) Convert the facility’s or agency’s license to a provisional or restricted license under § 44-506 pending satisfactory completion of an inspection conducted by the Mayor; or\n\n(B) Suspend the facility’s or agency’s license based upon a finding that loss of accreditation or certification was prompted by existing deficiencies that constitute an immediate or serious and continuing danger to the health, safety, or welfare of its patients/clients/residents.\n\n(2) The Mayor may, prior to a hearing, suspend the license of any facility or agency or convert its license to a provisional or restricted license if he or she determines that existing deficiencies constitute an immediate or serious and continuing danger to the health, safety, or welfare of its patients/clients/residents.\n\n(3) Upon the suspension or conversion of a license pursuant to this subsection, the Mayor shall immediately give the facility or agency written notice of the action, including a copy of the order of suspension or conversion, a statement of the grounds for the action, and notification that the facility or agency has 7 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from the day written notice is received to request an expedited, preliminary review hearing. If the facility or agency fails to communicate, either orally or in writing, a timely request for a preliminary review hearing, the order of suspension or conversion shall remain in effect until terminated by the Mayor or an unexpedited hearing is held pursuant to procedures adopted under § 44-504. Upon receipt of a timely request for an expedited, preliminary review hearing, the Mayor shall within 72 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) provide a hearing to review the reasonableness of the suspension or conversion order. At this hearing, the Mayor shall have the burden of establishing a prima facie case of immediate or serious and continuing endangerment. The suspension or conversion order shall be either affirmed or vacated at the hearing. In the event an order is affirmed, it shall, unless extended, remain in effect for no longer than 30 calendar days, during which time a final hearing shall be scheduled to consider the appropriateness of revocation or continuing restrictions on licensure. Before expiration of a suspension or conversion order, an extension may be granted for a period not to exceed an additional 30 calendar days upon agreement of all the parties or for good cause shown.\n\n(e) The Mayor shall have the authority, upon a showing of undue hardship and if not inconsistent with other provisions of this chapter or deleterious to the public health and safety, to grant variances with respect to the standards to be established under § 44-504(a)(3) and (h-1). The Mayor shall maintain a public record listing all variances granted under this subsection and containing a complete written explanation of the basis for each variance.",

As part of its overall responsibility for the operation of a facility or agency, the governing body, or designated persons so functioning, shall ensure that decisions on clinical privileges and staff membership are based on an objective evaluation of an applicant’s credentials, free of anticompetitive intent or purpose. Whenever possible, the credentials committee and other staff who evaluate and determine the qualifications of applicants for clinical privileges and staff membership shall include members of the applicant’s profession. The credentials committee shall accept the District of Columbia’s uniform credentialing form as the sole application for a healthcare provider to become credentialed or recredentialed.\n\n(1) The following are not valid factors for consideration in the determination of qualifications for staff membership or clinical privileges:\n\n(A) An applicant’s membership or lack of membership in a professional society or association;\n\n(B) An applicant’s decision to advertise, lower fees, or engage in other competitive acts intended to solicit business;\n\n(C) An applicant’s participation in prepaid group health plans, salaried employment, or any other manner of delivering health services on other than a fee-for-service basis;\n\n(D) An applicant’s support for, training of, or participation in a private group practice with members of a particular class of health professional;\n\n(E) An applicant’s practices with respect to testifying in malpractice suits, disciplinary actions, or any other type of proceeding; and\n\n(F) An applicant’s willingness to send a certain amount of patients/clients who are in need of the services of a facility or agency to a particular facility or agency; provided, that this last restriction shall not apply to public facilities and agencies.\n\n(2) Each facility or agency shall formulate procedures to ensure that the foregoing factors play no part when decisions regarding clinical privileges and staff membership are made. In any action brought by an individual against a facility or agency regarding a determination of clinical privileges or staff membership, the facility or agency shall have the burden of proving that none of these considerations were a factor in the determination.\n\n(c) No provision of District of Columbia law, institutional or staff bylaw of a facility or agency, rule or regulation, or practice shall prohibit qualified advanced practice registered nurses, podiatrists, or psychologists from being accorded clinical privileges and appointed to all categories of staff membership at those facilities and agencies that offer the kinds of services that can be performed by either members of these health professions or physicians.\n\n(d) General and family practitioners who have demonstrated a current competence in the performance of particular services or procedures shall not be discriminated against with respect to staff membership or the accordance and delineation of clinical privileges on account of their type of practice.\n\n(e) If a facility or agency offers the types of services that can be performed by physician assistants or other, analogous health professional assistants, it shall establish clearly defined and objective procedures for the processing and evaluation of requests by members of these groups to provide such services at the facility or agency.\n\n(f) Whenever a health professional submits a completed application for staff membership or clinical privileges to a facility or agency, that facility or agency shall have 120 calendar days to grant or deny the application.
