Heckler;\n\n(3) The District and federal governments bear equitable shares of the costs of a transition from the present system to a comprehensive District mental health system;\n\n(4) The transition to a comprehensive District mental health system provided for by this subchapter be carried out with maximum consideration for the interests of employees of the Hospital and provide a right-of-first-refusal to such employees for employment at comparable levels in positions created under the system implementation plan;\n\n(5) The federal government have the responsibility for the retraining of Hospital employees to prepare such employees for the requirements of employment in a comprehensive District mental health system;\n\n(6) The federal government continue high quality mental health research, training, and demonstration programs at Saint Elizabeths Hospital;\n\n(7) The District government establish and maintain accreditation and licensing standards for all services provided in District mental health facilities which assure quality care consistent with appropriate federal regulations and comparable with standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals; and\n\n(8) The comprehensive mental health system plan include a component for direct services for the homeless mentally ill.",
