A term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the offender is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a federal, state, or local crime unless the period of imprisonment is less than 30 days.\n\n(6) Offenders on supervised release shall be subject to the authority of the United States Parole Commission until completion of the term of supervised release.
