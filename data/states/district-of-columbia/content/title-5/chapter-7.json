Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service shall be provided in accordance with section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(c) Credit shall be allowed for leaves of absence granted a member while performing military service, excluding from credit so much of any other leaves of absence without pay as may exceed 6 months in the aggregate in any calendar year.\n\n(d) A member who, during any war or national emergency as proclaimed by the President or declared by the Congress, has left or leaves his position to enter the military service shall not be considered, for the purposes of this subchapter, as separated from his position by reason of such military service, unless he shall apply for and receive his salary deductions: provided, that such member shall not be considered as retaining such position beyond December 31, 1957, or the expiration of 5 years of such military service, whichever is later.\n\n(1) A member shall be allowed credit for government service performed prior to appointment in any of the departments mentioned in paragraph (1) of § 5-701, if such member deposits a sum equal to the entire amount, including interest (if any), refunded to him for such period of government service. A member who is an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia shall deposit such sum, plus interest computed in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, with the Custodian of Retirement Funds (as defined in § 1-702(6)) for deposit in the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters’ Retirement Fund established by § 1-712. All other members shall deposit such sums with the District of Columbia Retirement Board for credit to the revenues of the District of Columbia. If the member so elects, he may deposit the total amount of such refund in monthly installments not exceeding 24, except that in the case of a member who is an officer or member of the United States Park Police force, the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, or the United States Secret Service Division, such monthly installments shall be of equal amounts. No deposit shall be required for days of unused sick leave credited under § 5-712.\n\n(2) Interest required on deposits under this subsection for members who are officers or members of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia shall be computed as follows:\n\n(A) Interest shall be paid at a rate which (as determined by the District of Columbia Retirement Board) is equal to the average rate of return on investment (adjusted to the nearest one eighth of 1%) for the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters’ Retirement Fund (established by § 1-712) for the period beginning on the 1st day of the 1st month which begins after the end of the service with respect to which the deposit is made and ending on the last day of the month which precedes the month during which the deposit is made if he makes a lump-sum payment or during which he makes the 1st monthly payment if he makes monthly payments, except that for so much of any such period which precedes October 1, 1981, the average rate of interest on interest-bearing obligations of the United States forming a part of the public debt (adjusted to the nearest one eighth of 1%) shall be used in determining the interest rate to be paid on deposits under this subsection;\n\n(B) Interest shall be payable for the period beginning on the 1st day of the 1st month which begins after the end of the period of service with respect to which the deposit is made and ending on the last day of the month which precedes the month during which the deposit is made; and\n\n(C) If a member elects to make his deposit in monthly installments, each monthly payment shall include interest on that portion of the refund which is then being redeposited.\n\n(1) Any period of time during which a member who is an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia is on approved leave without pay to serve as a full-time officer or employee of a labor organization shall be considered to be police or fire service for purposes of this subchapter if such member files an election in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection and makes payments as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection. The basic salary in effect at any time for the grade in which a member was serving at the time he entered on approved leave described in the preceding sentence shall be considered to be the basic salary in effect for such member for purposes of this subchapter if the period of time when such member is on approved leave is considered to be police or fire service under this subsection.\n\n(2) To be eligible to have any period of approved leave described in paragraph (1) of this subsection considered to be police or fire service for purposes of this subchapter, a member described in such paragraph must, not later than the end of the 60-day period commencing on the day such member enters on such approved leave or the effective date of this subsection, whichever occurs later, file an election with the [District of Columbia Retirement Board] to have such period of approved leave considered to be police or fire service for purposes of this subchapter.\n\n(A) To have any period of approved leave described in paragraph (1) of this subsection occurring after the effective date of this subchapter considered to be police or fire service, a member described in such paragraph must each month deposit with the Custodian of Retirement Funds (as defined in § 1-702(6)) for deposit in the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters’ Retirement Fund established by § 1-712 a sum equal to one-twelfth the annual new entrant normal cost of the annuity of a member receiving the basic salary in effect during such month for the grade in which such member was serving at the time such member entered on such leave.\n\n(B) To have any period of approved leave described in paragraph (1) of this subsection which occurred before the effective date of this subchapter considered to be police or fire service, a member described in such paragraph must deposit with the Custodian of Retirement Funds (as defined in § 1-702(6)) for deposit in the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters’ Retirement Fund established by § 1-712, in a manner to be determined by the District of Columbia Retirement Board, a sum equal to the new entrant normal cost of the annuity of a member receiving the basic salary in effect during the period of such leave for the grade in which such member was serving at the time such member entered on such leave.\n\n(C) The District of Columbia Retirement Board shall make an annual determination of the new entrant normal cost for purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph according to information supplied by the actuary retained pursuant to § 1-722.\n\n(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term “labor organization” means any labor organization recognized as an exclusive representative of members or officers of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia for purposes of collective bargaining pursuant to § 1-617.10.\n\n(g) The total service of a member shall be the full years and 12th parts thereof, excluding from the aggregate any fractional part of a month.\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any military service (other than military service covered by military leave with pay from a civilian position) performed by an individual after December 1956 shall be excluded in determining the aggregate period of service upon which an annuity payable under this chapter to such individual or to the surviving spouse or child is to be based, if such individual or the surviving spouse or child is entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled), at the time of such determination, to monthly old age or survivors benefits under § 202 of the Social Security Act based on such individual’s wages and self-employment income. If in the case of the individual or the surviving spouse such military service is not excluded under the preceding sentence, but upon attaining retirement age (as defined in § 216(a) of the Social Security Act) he or she becomes entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled) to such benefits, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall re-determine the aggregate period of service upon which such annuity is based, effective as of the 1st day of the month in which he or she attains such age, so as to exclude such service. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, upon the request of the Mayor, inform the Mayor whether or not any such individual or the surviving spouse or child is entitled at any specified time to such benefits; and the Mayor shall forward this information to the District of Columbia Retirement Board.\n\n(i) Except as provided in sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph, and subject to subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, each member or former member who has performed military service before the date of the separation on which the entitlement to any annuity under this chapter is based may elect to retain credit for the service by paying (in accordance with such regulations as the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall issue) to the office by which the member is employed (or, in the case of a former member, to the appropriate benefits administrator) an amount equal to 7 percent of the amount of the basic pay paid under section 204 of title 37, United States Code, to the member for each period of military service after December 1956. The amount of such payments shall be based on such evidence of basic pay for military service as the member may provide, or, if the District of Columbia Retirement Board determines sufficient evidence has not been so provided to adequately determine basic pay for military service, such payment shall be based upon estimates of such basic pay provided to the District of Columbia Retirement Board under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph. Payment of such amount by an active member must be completed prior to the member’s date of retirement or October 1, 2006, whichever is later, for the member to retain credit for the service.\n\n(ii) In any case where military service interrupts creditable service under this section and reemployment pursuant to chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code [38 U.S.C. § 4301 et seq.], occurs on or after August 1, 1990, the deposit payable under this subparagraph may not exceed the amount that would have been deducted and withheld under this chapter from basic pay during the period of creditable service if the member had not performed the period of military service.\n\n(B) Any deposit made under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph more than 2 years after the later of:\n\n(i) October 1, 2004; or\n\n(ii) The date on which the member making the deposit first becomes a member following the period of military service for which such deposit is due, shall include interest on such amount computed and compounded annually beginning on the date of the expiration of the 2-year period. The interest rate that is applicable in computing interest in any year under this subsection shall be equal to the interest rate that is applicable for such year under subsection (e)(2).\n\n(C) The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as appropriate, shall furnish such information to the District of Columbia Retirement Board as the District of Columbia Retirement Board may determine to be necessary for the administration of this section; and the Mayor shall forward this information to the District of Columbia Retirement Board.\n\n(D) Effective with respect to any period of military service after November 10, 1996, the percentage of basic pay under 37 U.S.C. § 204, payable under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be equal to the same percentage as would be applicable under § 5-706 for that same period for service as a member subject to subparagraph (A)(2) of this paragraph.\n\n(1) Any member who is an officer or member of the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department who was transferred pursuant to § 5-409.01, and who elects to, shall be covered by Chapter 9 of Title 1, and shall receive credit for prior years of service within the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department as provided in subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection.\n\n(2) Solely for the purposes of determining vesting and retirement eligibility, members shall receive credit for prior service with the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department.\n\n(A) Members shall be eligible to purchase benefit accrual service for some or all of the time they were employed by the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department. The member shall deposit to the credit of the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters’ Retirement Fund an amount that is equal to the dollar increase in the present value of future benefits which results from crediting the prior service. The present value of future benefits shall be calculated on the actuarial assumptions and methods used to calculate the present value of future benefits pursuant to § 1-907.03(a)(3)(B) for the applicable fiscal year. Upon separation from District of Columbia employment for reasons other than retirement, any firefighter who purchased prior service credit shall receive that purchased amount along with any interest credited to the amount. Any firefighter who withdraws the purchased amount and is later reinstated shall not be entitled to this prior service credit until the purchased amount plus interest is again deposited.\n\n(B) If a member was a participant in the defined contribution plan established pursuant to § 1-626.05(3), the member may transfer all or a portion of his or her defined contribution plan account balance into the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters' Retirement Fund toward his or her purchase of prior service with the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this section, the term “prior service” means any prior service in the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, regardless of whether there is a break in service.\n\n(j) Service as a retired police officer hired pursuant to § 5-761, shall not count as creditable service for the purposes of this section.\n\n(1) An employee hired as a lateral law enforcement officer pursuant to § 1-610.72, shall be covered by Chapter 9 of Title 1. These lateral law enforcement officers shall be treated as new hires for retirement purposes and for the purposes of this section except as provided by law for federal government and military service and as provided by paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) In computing length of service of a retiring lateral law enforcement officer hired pursuant to § 1-610.72, credit shall be granted for prior law enforcement service outside the Metropolitan Police Department only if the lateral law enforcement officer has deposited to the credit of the Police Officers’ and Firefighters’ Retirement Fund an amount equal to the dollar increase in the present value of future benefits that results from crediting the prior service. The calculation of the present value of future benefits shall be based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used to calculate the present value of future benefits pursuant to § 1-907.03(a)(3)(B) for the applicable fiscal year. Upon separation from District law enforcement duty for reasons other than retirement, any law enforcement officer who purchased prior service credit shall receive that purchase amount along with any interest credited on the amount. Any law enforcement officer that withdraws the purchase amount and is later reinstated shall not be entitled to this prior service credit until the purchase amount plus interest is again deposited.\n\n(l) Service as a former Metropolitan Police Department detective hired as a detective advisor pursuant to § 5-129.31 [expired] shall not count as creditable service for the purposes of this section.",

In the case of a member who is an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia, these deductions and withholdings shall be paid to the District of Columbia Retirement Board and shall be deposited in the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters’ Retirement Fund established by § 1-712, and in the case of any other member, these deductions and withholdings shall be paid to the Collector of Taxes of the District of Columbia and shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the District of Columbia. Amounts deducted and withheld from the basic salary of each member of the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department shall be:\n\n(1) Picked up by the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, as described in section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n\n(2) Deducted and withheld from the annual salary of the members as salary reduction contributions;\n\n(3) Paid by the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department to the Custodian of Retirement Funds (as defined in § 1-702(6)); and\n\n(4) Made a part of the member’s annuity benefit.\n\n(1) Any member who is an officer or member of the United States Park Police force, the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, or the United States Secret Service Division, who is separated from his department, except for retirement as authorized by this subchapter, shall be refunded the amount of the deductions made from his salary under such sections. The receipt of payment of such deductions by such member shall void all annuity rights under such sections, unless and until such member shall be reappointed to any department whose members come under such sections. If such officer or member is subsequently reappointed to any department whose members come under such sections, he shall be required to redeposit the amount of deductions so refunded to him.\n\n(2) Any member who is an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia with less than 5 years of police or fire service who is separated from his department, except for retirement under § 5-709, § 5-710, or § 5-712, shall be refunded the amount of the deductions made from his salary under this subchapter. The receipt of payment of such deductions by such member shall void all annuity rights under this subchapter, except that if such member is subsequently reappointed to any department whose members come under this subchapter and such member elects, at the time of such reappointment, to redeposit the amount refunded to him pursuant to the preceding sentence plus interest computed in accordance with § 5-717(c), then credit shall be allowed under this subchapter for the prior period of service. Such redeposit (and the interest required thereon) may be made, at the election of the member, in a lump sum or in not to exceed 60 monthly installments, except that if such member dies before depositing the full amount due under the preceding sentence, the requirements of such sentence shall be deemed to have been met.\n\n(c) In order to facilitate the settlement of the accounts of each member coming under the provisions of this subchapter who dies prior to retirement leaving no survivor entitled to receive an annuity under the provisions of such sections, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall pay all deductions for retirement made from the salary of such deceased member to the person or persons surviving at the time of death, in the following order of precedence, and such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person of amounts so paid:\n\n(1) To the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated in writing by such member, filed with the District of Columbia Retirement Board and received by him prior to the death of such member;\n\n(2) If there be no such beneficiary, to the child or children of such deceased member and the descendants of deceased children by representation;\n\n(3) If there be none of the above, to the parents of such member, or the survivor of them;\n\n(4) If there be none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the estate of the deceased member, or if there be none to the person or persons determined to be entitled thereto under the laws of the domicile of the deceased member; provided, that if no natural person is determined to be entitled thereto such payment shall escheat to the government of the District of Columbia, except that if the member was an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia, no payment shall be made if no natural person is determined to be entitled thereto.\n\n(d) In order to facilitate the settlement of the accounts of each former member coming under the provisions of this subchapter who dies leaving no survivor entitled to receive an annuity under the provisions of this subchapter and before the aggregate amount of the annuity paid to such former member equals the total amount deducted and withheld for retirement from his salary as a member, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall pay the difference to the person or persons surviving at the time of death in the following order of precedence, and such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person of the amount so paid:\n\n(1) To the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated in writing by such former member, filed with the District of Columbia Retirement Board and received by him prior to the death of such former member;\n\n(2) If there be no such beneficiary, to the child or children of such deceased former member and the descendants of deceased children by representation;\n\n(3) If there be none of the above, to the parents of such former member, or the survivor of them; and\n\n(4) If there be none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the estate of the deceased former member, or if there be none to the person or persons determined to be entitled thereto under the laws of the domicile of the deceased former member: provided, that if no natural person is determined to be entitled thereto such payment shall escheat to the government of the District of Columbia, except that if the member was an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia, no payment shall be made if no natural person is determined to be entitled thereto.\n\n(e) An individual withdrawing a distribution under this subchapter, which distribution constitutes an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the District of Columbia Retirement Board, and after receipt of proper notice, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan, within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, in a direct rollover in accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n(f) The District of Columbia Retirement Board shall be entrusted with any transfer from another retirement plan for the purchase of service credit, including transfers allowed by sections 403(b) and 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. § 403; 26 U.S.C. § 457]. Before any transfer is received, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall be presented with documentation sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 governing the substantiation of proposed transfers for the purchase of service credit.\n\n(1) The District of Columbia Retirement Board shall also be entrusted with a rollover contribution from an eligible retirement plan, including:\n\n(A) A qualified plan described in sections 401(a) or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, excluding after-tax employee contributions;\n\n(B) An annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, excluding after-tax employee contributions;\n\n(C) An eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state; or\n\n(D) Amounts transferred from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is eligible to be rolled over and would otherwise be includible in gross income.\n\n(2) The rollover shall be separately accounted for as member contributions that were not previously taxed. Before any rollover is received, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall be presented with documentation sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 governing the substantiation of proposed rollover contributions. The rollover shall be used to purchase service credit in addition to service credit provided under the provisions of § 5-704.\n\n(h) The provisions of this subchapter shall constitute a defined benefit plan and a governmental plan as described in section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which is intended to qualify under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subchapter, Chapter 7 of Title 1 (§ 1-701 et seq.), or Chapter 9 of Title 1 (§ 1-901 et seq.), the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to and control the provision of an annuity payable. The District of Columbia Retirement Board shall administer the plan in the manner required to satisfy the applicable qualification requirements for a qualified governmental plan pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If a conflict should arise with a qualification requirement, the provision shall be interpreted in favor of maintaining the federal qualification requirements.\n\n(i) The District of Columbia Retirement Board may adopt rules to implement this section.\n\n(j) Effective January 1, 2007, benefits payable under this subchapter shall not be paid until at least 30 days (or shorter period as may be permitted by law) but no more than 180 days after a member’s receipt of all required distribution notices and election forms pursuant to section 402(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The required notices must include a description of the member’s right (if any) to defer receipt of a distribution, the consequences of failing to defer receipt of the distribution, the relative value of optional forms of benefit, and other information as may be required by applicable regulations and guidance.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any provisions of this subchapter to the contrary, upon the employer’s request, a contribution which was made by a mistake of fact shall be returned to the employer by the trustee within one year after the payment of the contribution. A portion of a contribution returned pursuant to this section shall be adjusted to reflect any earnings or gains. Notwithstanding any provisions of this subchapter to the contrary, the right or claim of a participant or beneficiary to an asset of the trust or a benefit under this subchapter shall be subject to and limited by the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(l) For the purposes of this section, the term:\n\n(1) “Direct rollover” means a payment to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee described in section 402(e)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n(2) “Distributee” means a member or former member. In addition, the member’s or former member’s surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. A non-spouse beneficiary of a deceased member is also a distributee for the purposes of this subchapter; provided, that in the case of a non-spouse beneficiary, the direct rollover may be made only to an individual retirement account or annuity under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is established on behalf of the non-spouse beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The determination of the extent to which a distribution to a non-spouse beneficiary is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be made in accordance with IRS Notice 2007-7, Q&A 17 and 18, 2007-5 I.R.B. 395.\n\n(3) “Eligible retirement plan” means:\n\n(A) An individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n\n(B) An individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n\n(C) A qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution;\n\n(D) An annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution; and\n\n(E) An eligible plan described in section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution and agrees to account separately for amounts transferred into such plan from the arrangement described under this subsection. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order.\n\n(4) “Eligible rollover distribution,” within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, is a distribution of all or a portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee; provided, that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:\n\n(A) A distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more; and\n\n(B) A distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A distribution to a nonspouse beneficiary under section 401(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is an eligible rollover distribution. A portion of the distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, the portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or to a qualified trust or annuity plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if the trust or annuity plan or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible.",

The Mayor shall promulgate regulations establishing such criteria in a timely manner based on the recommendations of the Board.\n\n(1) In making determinations under this section and under § 4-615, the Board of Police and Fire Surgeons and the Police and Firefighters Retirement and Relief Board shall make full use of the medical resources in the District of Columbia and shall make the widest practical use of the medical expertise available to them consistent with fair and even administration of Chapter 7 of Title 1.\n\n(2) Not later than 90 days after November 17, 1979, the Board of Police and Fire Surgeons and the Police and Firefighters Retirement and Relief Board shall each submit to the Mayor recommendations for regulations to carry out the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection. The Mayor shall, in a timely manner and based on the recommendations of such Boards, promulgate regulations to carry out the requirements of such paragraph.\n\n(3) Failure to promulgate such regulations, or failure to comply with such regulations, shall not invalidate any decision of the Mayor or the Police and Firefighters Retirement and Relief Board with respect to the retirement of any individual.",

The Mayor shall not require employment questionnaires under § 5-714(c)(5) or the medical examination of such member under paragraph (2) of this subsection after such member reaches the age of 50.\n\n(2) The Mayor shall, by regulation, require any annuitant who was an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia and who retired before, on, or after November 17, 1979, under § 5-709 or § 5-710 to undergo, during each 12-month period following the effective date of this paragraph, at least 1 medical examination of the disability upon which the annuitant’s retirement under § 5-709 or § 5-710 is based. No such annuitant shall be required under such regulations to undergo a medical examination during any such 12-month period during which the annuitant was required to undergo a medical examination under this section in connection with such annuitant’s employment. Such annual examination shall be carried out by the Board of Police and Fire Surgeons or by a physician designated by the Board.\n\n(3) Such regulations shall further provide for notification by the Board of Police and Fire Surgeons to each such annuitant as to the time and place for such examination and the consequences of failure to appear and submit to such examination.\n\n(4) In any case in which the requirement to undergo a medical examination under this subchapter would impose on an annuitant an undue hardship because of the physical or mental condition of such annuitant, the Mayor, by regulation, shall provide other means sufficient to determine the continuance of the disability on which such annuitant’s retirement under § 5-709 or § 5-710 is based.\n\n(5) Such regulations shall further provide that, in any case involving any such member so retired who refuses or otherwise fails to undergo any medical exam required by this subchapter, payment of the annuity to such member shall cease and such member shall not be eligible to receive such annuity or any part thereof for any period commencing on the day next following the day on which such member was required to undergo such examination, and ending on the date on which such member undergoes such examination. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as affecting any rights to a survivor’s annuity under § 5-716 based upon the service of such member.\n\n(c) Except in a case of fraud against the District of Columbia, the Mayor may waive collection of any amount less than $100 which was paid to an annuitant in excess of the amount to which such annuitant was entitled under this subchapter.",

This provision shall apply only with respect to an individual who first receives benefits under this subchapter on or after October 1, 2002.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding foregoing provisions of this subchapter to the contrary, benefits under this subchapter are subject to the limitations imposed by section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as adjusted from time to time and, to that end, effective for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2008:\n\n(A) To the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and subject to the remainder of this subsection, the maximum monthly benefit to which any member may be entitled in any limitation year with respect to his or her accrued retirement benefit, as adjusted from time to time pursuant to § 5-718 (the “maximum benefit”), shall not exceed the defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted as provided in this subsection). In addition to the foregoing, to the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and subject to the remainder of this subsection, the maximum annual additions for any limitation year shall be equal to the lesser of:\n\n(i) The dollar limit on annual additions; or\n\n(ii) 100% of the member’s remuneration.\n\n(B) The defined benefit dollar limit and the dollar limit on annual additions shall be adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The dollar limit as adjusted under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies, but a member’s benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit before January 1 of that calendar year. To the extent that the monthly benefit payable to a member who has reached the member’s termination date is limited by the application of this subsection, the limit shall be adjusted to reflect subsequent adjustments made in accordance with section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, but the adjusted limit shall apply only to benefits payable on or after January 1 of the calendar year for which the adjustment applies.\n\n(2) Benefits shall be actuarially adjusted based upon the defined benefit dollar limit, as follows:\n\n(A) There shall be an adjustment for benefits payable in a form other than a straight life annuity as follows:\n\n(i) If a monthly benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, before applying the defined benefit dollar limit, the benefit shall be adjusted in the manner described in sub-subparagraphs (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, to the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that begins at the same time. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for:\n\n(I) Benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits, such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits; or\n\n(II) In the case of a form of benefit not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the inclusion of a feature under which a benefit increases automatically to the extent permitted to reflect cost-of-living adjustments and the increase, if any, in the defined benefit dollar limit under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n(ii) If the benefit of a member is paid in a form not subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity, without regard to cost-of-living adjustments described in this subsection, is equal to the greater of:\n\n(I) The annual amount of the straight life annuity, if any, payable to the member commencing at the same time; or\n\n(II) The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n(iii) If the benefit of a member is paid in a form subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greatest of:\n\n(I) The annual amount of the straight life annuity having a commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified in the definition of actuarial equivalent for adjusting benefits in the same form;\n\n(II) The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the time that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using a 5.5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or\n\n(III) The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using the applicable interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, divided by 1.05.\n\n(iv) For the purposes of this subparagraph, whether a form of benefit is subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code is determined without regard to the status of this subchapter as a governmental plan as described in section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n(B) There shall be an adjustment to benefits that commence before age 62 or after age 65 as follows:\n\n(i) If the benefit of a member begins before age 62, the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at the earlier age shall be an annual benefit payable in the form a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at age 62 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. However, if the benefit provided under this subchapter provides an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:\n\n(I) The limitation determined under the immediately preceding sentence; or\n\n(II) The defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at the age of benefit commencement to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. The adjustment in this sub-subparagraph shall not apply as a result of benefits paid on account of disability under § 5-709 or § 5-710 or as a result of the death of a member under § 5-716. Notwithstanding the provisions above, a member that qualifies under section 415(b)(2(G) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is not subject to the adjustment to benefits that commence before age 62.\n\n(ii) If the benefit of a member begins after age 65, the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at the later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the defined benefit dollar limit applicable at age 65 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the benefit provided under this subchapter provides an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:\n\n(I) The limitation determined under the immediately preceding sentence; or\n\n(II) The defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted for participation of less than 10 years, if applicable) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at the age of benefit commencement to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at the age the benefit commences is the annual amount of the annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member’s accruals after age 65 but including any actuarial adjustments, even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under this subchapter to a hypothetical member who is age 65 and has the same annuity as the member.\n\n(iii) For the purposes of this subparagraph, no adjustment shall be made to the defined benefit dollar limit to reflect the probability of a member’s death between the commencing date and age 62, or between age 65 and the commencing date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member before the annuity having a commencing date. To the extent that benefits are forfeited upon death before the date the benefits first commence, an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member’s death if the benefit provided under this subchapter does not charge the member for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined for purposes of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, upon the member’s death.\n\n(3) If the member has fewer than 10 years of participation in the defined benefit portion of this subchapter, as determined under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the regulations thereunder, the defined benefit dollar limit shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation under this subchapter and the denominator of which is 10. The adjustment in this paragraph shall not apply to benefits paid on account of disability under § 5-709 or § 5-710 or as a result of the death of a member under § 5-716. In the case of years of credited service credited to a member pursuant to § 5-704:\n\n(A) The limitations contained in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection and this paragraph shall not apply to the portion of the member’s accrued retirement benefit (determined as of the annuity commencement date) that is attributable to any additional years of credited service under § 5-704 that are actuarially funded by:\n\n(i) A transfer or rollover from the member’s account under a retirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or an eligible deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or from an individual retirement account; or\n\n(ii) A direct payment.\n\n(B) The limitations contained in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection and this paragraph shall apply to the portion of the member’s accrued retirement benefit (determined as of the annuity commencement date) that is attributable to any additional years of credited service under § 5-704 that are not actuarially funded by:\n\n(i) A transfer or rollover from the member’s account under a retirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or an eligible deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or from an individual retirement account; or\n\n(ii) A direct payment.\n\n(C) The determination of the extent to which additional years of credited service under § 5-704 have been actuarially funded as of the annuity commencement date shall be determined in accordance with section 411(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (using the actuarial assumptions thereunder), applied as if section 411(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applied and treating the amount transferred from a plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the member’s account under an eligible deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or an individual retirement account, or the amount of the direct lump-sum payment to the Custodian of Retirement Funds, as if it were a mandatory employee contribution.\n\n(4) In addition to the foregoing, the maximum benefit and contributions shall be reduced, and the rate of benefit accrual shall be frozen or reduced accordingly, to the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with respect to a member who is also a participant in:\n\n(A) Another tax-qualified retirement plan maintained by the District, including a defined benefit plan in which an individual medical benefit account as described in section 415(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has been established for the member;\n\n(B) A welfare plan maintained by the District in which a separate account, as described in section 419A(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, has been established to provide post-retirement medical benefits for the member; or\n\n(C) A retirement or welfare plan, as previously mentioned, maintained by an affiliated or predecessor employer, as described in regulations under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or otherwise required to be taken into account under these regulations.\n\n(5) If a member has distributions commencing at more than one date, determined in accordance with section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and associated regulations, the annuity payable having this commencement date shall satisfy the limitations of this subsection as of each date, actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other dates that benefits commence.\n\n(6) The application of the provisions of this subsection shall not cause the maximum permissible benefit for a member to be less than the member’s annuity under this subchapter as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007 under provisions of this subchapter that were both adopted and in effect before April 5, 2007 and that satisfied the limitations under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as in effect as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007.\n\n(7) To the extent that a member’s benefit is subject to provisions of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code that have not been set forth in this subchapter, the provisions are hereby incorporated by reference and for all purposes shall be deemed a part of this subchapter.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, all death benefit payments referred to in this section shall be distributed only in accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and accompanying Treasury regulations, as more fully set forth in § 5-723.03.\n\n(d) For the purposes of this section, the term:\n\n(1) “Annual additions” means the sum of the following items credited to the member under this subchapter and any other tax-qualified retirement plan sponsored by the District for a limitation year and treated as a defined contribution plan for purposes of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986: District contributions that are separately allocated to the member’s credit in an defined contribution plan; forfeitures; member contributions; and amounts credited after March 31, 1984 to a member’s individual medical account within the meaning of section 415(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n(2) “Defined benefit dollar limit” means the dollar limit imposed by section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The defined benefit dollar limit as set forth above is the monthly amount payable in the form of a straight life annuity, beginning no earlier than age 62, except as provided in subsection (b)(2)(B)(i) of this section, and no later than age 65. In the case of a monthly amount payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, or beginning before age 62 or after age 65, the adjustments in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall apply.\n\n(3) “Dollar limit” means the dollar limit on annual additions imposed by section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n(D) “Remuneration” means a member’s wages as defined in section 3401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other payments of salary to the member from the District, for which the District is required to furnish the member a written statement under sections 6041(d) and 6051(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For this purpose:\n\n(A) Remuneration shall be determined without regard to rules that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed.\n\n(B) Remuneration shall include an amount that would otherwise be deemed remuneration under this definition but for the fact that it is subject to a salary reduction agreement under a plan described in sections 457(b), 132(f) or 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n(C) Remuneration with respect to any limitation year shall in no event exceed the dollar limit specified in section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as adjusted from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to remuneration for the limitation year that begins with or within such calendar year.",

The provisions of this section shall apply for the purposes of determining minimum required distributions under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this subchapter; provided, that these provisions are intended solely to reflect the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and accompanying Treasury regulations and are not intended to provide or expand, and shall not be construed as providing or expanding, a benefit or distribution option not otherwise expressly provided for under the terms of this subchapter. The provisions of this section shall apply only to the extent required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as applied to a governmental plan, and if special rules for governmental plans are not set forth herein, the special rules are incorporated by reference and shall for all purposes be deemed a part of this subchapter.\n\n(1) The member’s entire interest shall be distributed or begin being distributed to the member no later than April 1 following the later of:\n\n(A) The calendar year in which the member attains age 70 1/2; or\n\n(B) The calendar year in which the member retires or terminates employment (the “required beginning date”).\n\n(2) If the member dies before distributions begin, the member’s entire interest shall be distributed, or will begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:\n\n(A) If the member’s surviving spouse is the sole designated beneficiary, distributions to the surviving spouse shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70 1/2, if later;\n\n(B) If the member’s surviving spouse is not the sole designated beneficiary, distributions to the designated beneficiary shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died;\n\n(C) If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member’s death, the member’s entire interest shall be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year of the 5th anniversary of the member’s death;\n\n(D) If the member’s surviving spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply, and subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. For the purposes of this paragraph and subsection (d) of this section, distributions are considered to begin on the member’s required beginning date or, if this subparagraph applies, the date distributions to the surviving spouse are required to begin under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. If annuity payments to the member irrevocably commence before the member’s required beginning date or to the member’s surviving spouse before the date distributions to the surviving spouse are required to begin under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.\n\n(3) Unless the member’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution, calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) of this section. If the member’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions of the annuity will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and applicable Treasury regulations. Any part of the member’s interest that is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts.\n\n(1) The amount of the annuity is to be determined each year.\n\n(2) If the member’s interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions, payments under the annuity shall satisfy the following requirements:\n\n(A) The annuity distributions shall be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year;\n\n(B) Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows:\n\n(i) By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index based on prices of all items (the CPI-W) and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics;\n\n(ii) To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the teacher’s death;\n\n(iii) To pay increased benefits that result from an amendment to this subchapter.\n\n(3) The amount that must be distributed on or before the member’s required beginning date or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection (b)(2)(A) or (B) of this section, is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received (for example, bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually). All of the member’s benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year shall be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member’s required beginning date.\n\n(4) Additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year shall be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.\n\n(d) Amounts payable if a member dies before distribution begins are subject to the following requirements:\n\n(1) If the member dies before the date of distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the member’s entire interest shall be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subsection (b)(2)(A) or (B) of this section, over the life of the designated beneficiary not exceeding either of the following:\n\n(A) Unless the benefit commenced is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, determined using the beneficiary’s age as of the beneficiary’s birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the teacher’s death; or\n\n(B) If the benefit commenced before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, determined using the beneficiary’s age as of his or her birthday in the calendar year that begins before benefits commence; or\n\n(2) If the member dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member’s death, distribution of the member’s entire interest shall be completed by December 31 of the calendar year of the fifth anniversary of the member’s death; or\n\n(3) If the member dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, the member’s surviving spouse is the member’s sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the member, except that the time by which distributions must begin shall be determined without regard to subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section.",
