Not later than 120 days after conveyance of legal or equitable title to nondeveloper co-owners of 75% of the units that may be created, and before conveyance of 90% of such units, the nondeveloper co-owners shall elect all directors on the board, except that the developer shall have the right to designate at least 1 director as long as the developer owns and offers for sale at least 10% of the units in the project or as long as 10% of the units remain that may be created.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the formula provided in subsection (2), 54 months after the first conveyance of legal or equitable title to a nondeveloper co-owner of a unit in the project, if title to not less than 75% of the units that may be created has not been conveyed, the nondeveloper co-owners have the right to elect, as provided in the condominium documents, a number of members of the board of directors of the association of co-owners equal to the percentage of units they hold and the developer has the right to elect, as provided in the condominium documents, a number of members of the board equal to the percentage of units which are owned by the developer and for which all assessments are payable by the developer. This election may increase, but does not reduce, the minimum election and designation rights otherwise established in subsection (2). Application of this subsection does not require a change in the size of the board as determined in the condominium documents.\n\n(4) If the calculation of the percentage of members of the board that the nondeveloper co-owners have the right to elect under subsection (2), or if the product of the number of members of the board multiplied by the percentage of units held by the nondeveloper co-owners under subsection (3) results in a right of nondeveloper co-owners to elect a fractional number of members of the board, then a fractional election right of 0.5 or greater shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number, which number shall be the number of members of the board that the nondeveloper co-owners have the right to elect. After application of the formula contained in this subsection, the developer has the right to elect the remaining members of the board. Application of this subsection does not eliminate the right of the developer to designate 1 member as provided in subsection (2).\n\n(5) A consolidating master deed and plans showing the condominium as built shall be recorded not later than 1 year after completion of construction in order to consolidate all phases or amendments of a condominium project. A copy of the recorded consolidating master deed shall be provided to the association of co-owners.\n\n(6) As used in this section, \"units that may be created\" means the maximum number of units in all phases of the condominium project as stated in the master deed.\n\n(7) For purposes of calculating the timing of events described in this section, conveyance by a developer to a residential builder, even though not an affiliate of the developer, is not considered a sale to a nondeveloper co-owner until such time as the residential builder conveys that unit with a completed residence on it or until it contains a completed residence which is occupied.\n\nHistory:1978, Act 59, Eff.

A co-owner's condominium unit dimensions or appurtenant limited common elements may not be modified without the co-owner's consent.\n\n(5) Co-owners shall be notified of proposed amendments under this section not less than 10 days before the amendment is recorded.\n\n(6) A person causing or requesting an amendment to the condominium documents shall be responsible for costs and expenses of the amendment, except for amendments based upon a vote of a prescribed majority of co-owners and mortgagees or based upon the advisory committee's decision, the costs of which are expenses of administration.\n\n(7) A master deed amendment, including the consolidating master deed, dealing with the addition, withdrawal, or modification of units or other physical characteristics of the project shall comply with the standards prescribed in section 66 for preparation of an original condominium subdivision plan for the project.\n\n(8) For purposes of this section, the affirmative vote of a 2/3 of co-owners is considered 2/3 of all co-owners entitled to vote as of the record date for such votes.\n\nHistory:1978, Act 59, Eff.

To the extent that any item referred to in subsection (3)(c) and (d) is specifically depicted on the condominium subdivision plan, an estimate of the cost of substantial completion prepared by a licensed professional engineer or architect shall be required in place of the minimum expenditure specified in the recorded master deed or amendment.\n\n(b) A structure, element, facility or other improvement shall be deemed to be substantially complete when it can be reasonably employed for its intended use and, for purposes of certification under this section, shall not be required to be constructed, installed, or furnished precisely in accordance with the specifications for the project. A certificate of substantial completion shall not be deemed to be a certification as to the quality of the items to which it relates.\n\n(5) In place of retaining funds in escrow under subsection (3), the developer may, if the escrow agreement so provides, furnish an escrow agent with evidence of adequate security, including, without limitation, an irrevocable letter of credit, lending commitment, indemnification agreement, or other resource having a value, in the judgment of the escrow agent, of not less than the amount retained pursuant to subsection (3).\n\n(6) Upon receipt of a certificate issued pursuant to subsection (3)(c) and (d) determining the amounts necessary for substantial completion, the escrow agent may release to the developer all funds in escrow in excess of the amounts determined by the issuer of such certificate to be necessary for substantial completion. In addition, upon receipt by the escrow agent of a certificate signed by a licensed professional engineer or architect confirming substantial completion in accordance with the pertinent plans of an item for which funds have been deposited in escrow, the escrow agent shall release to the developer the amount of such funds specified by the issuer of the certificate as being attributable to such substantially completed item. However, if the amounts remaining in escrow after such partial release would be insufficient in the opinion of the issuer of such certificate for substantial completion of any remaining incomplete items for which funds have been deposited in escrow, only the amount in escrow in excess of such estimated cost to substantially complete shall be released by the escrow agent to the developer. Notwithstanding a release of escrowed funds that is authorized or required by this section, an escrow agent may refuse to release funds from an escrow account if the escrow agent, in its judgment, has sufficient cause to believe the certificate confirming substantial completion or determining the amount necessary for substantial completion is fraudulent or without factual basis.\n\n(7) Not earlier than 9 months after closing the sale of the first unit in a phase of a condominium project for which escrowed funds have been retained under subsection (3)(c) or for which security has been provided under subsection (5), an escrow agent, upon the request of the association or any interested co-owner, shall notify the developer of the amount of funds deposited under subsection (3)(c) or security provided under subsection (5) for such purpose that remains, and of the date determined under this subsection upon which those funds can be released. In the case of a recreational facility or other facility intended for general common use, not earlier than 9 months after the date on which the facility was promised in the condominium documents to be completed by the developer, an escrow agent, upon the request of the association or any interested co-owner, shall notify the developer of the amount of funds deposited under subsection (3)(d) or security provided under subsection (5) for such purpose that remains, and of the date determined under this subsection upon which those funds can be released. Three months after receipt of a request pertaining to funds described in subsection (3)(c) or (3)(d), funds that have not yet been released to the developer may be released by the escrow agent for the purpose of completing incomplete improvements for which the funds were originally retained, or for a purpose specified in a written agreement between the association and the developer entered into after the transitional control date. The agreement may specify that issues relating to the use of the funds be submitted to arbitration. The escrow agent may release funds in the manner provided in such an agreement or may initiate an interpleader action and deposit retained funds with a court of competent jurisdiction. In any interpleader action, the circuit court shall be empowered, in its discretion, to appoint a receiver to administer the application of the funds. Any notice or request provided for in this subsection shall be in writing.\n\n(8) If interest is paid on the amounts escrowed under this act, that interest shall be released in the same manner as provided for release of funds in this section except that the parties may, by written agreement, provide that interest on funds refunded to a depositor upon withdrawal may be paid to the developer.\n\n(9) The escrow agent in the performance of its duties under this section shall be deemed an independent party not acting as the agent of the developer, any purchaser, co-owner, or other interested party. So long as the escrow agent relies upon any certificate, cost estimate, or determination made by a licensed professional engineer or architect, as described in this act, the escrow agent shall have no liability whatever to the developer or to any purchaser, co-owner, or other interested party for any error in such certificate, cost estimate, or determination, or for any act or omission by the escrow agent in reliance thereon. The escrow agent shall be relieved of all liability upon release, in accordance with this section, of all amounts deposited with it pursuant to this act.\n\n(10) A licensed professional architect or engineer undertaking to make a certification under this section shall be held to the normal standard of care required of a member of that profession in determining substantial completion and the estimated cost of substantial completion under this act, but such architect or engineer shall not be required to have designed the improvement or item or to have inspected or to have otherwise exercised supervisory control thereof during the course of construction or installation of the improvement or item with respect to which the certificate is delivered. The certification by a licensed professional architect or engineer shall not be construed to limit the developer's liability for any defect in construction.\n\n(11) For purposes of this section, \"licensed professional engineer or architect\" means a member of those professions who satisfies all requirements of the laws of this state for the practice of the profession, and who is not an employee of the developer or of a firm in which the developer or an officer or director of the developer is a principal or holds 10% or more of the outstanding shares of that firm.\n\nHistory:Add. 1983, Act 113, Imd.
