Recording of the waiver is constructive notice of the waiver to all persons dealing with the mortgage or with property described in the mortgage from the date the waiver is recorded. A waiver recorded under this section must be recorded in the same manner as are discharges of mortgages, and the register of deeds is entitled to the same fee as is charged for recording a real estate mortgage under section 2567 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.2567.\n\nHistory:1929, Act 236, Eff.
