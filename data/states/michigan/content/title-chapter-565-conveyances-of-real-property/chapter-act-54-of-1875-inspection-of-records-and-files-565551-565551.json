However, the custodian of the records and files may make reasonable rules and regulations with reference to the inspection and examination of the records and files as is necessary to protect the records and files and to prevent interference with the regular discharge of the duties of the register of deeds.\n\n(2) If an individual requests a reproduction of a record or file of a register of deeds, the register of deeds shall do 1 of the following, at the register of deeds' option:\n\n(a) Reproduce the record or file for the individual pursuant to the records reproduction act, 1992 PA 116, MCL 24.401 to 24.406, using a medium selected by the register of deeds.

This subdivision does not apply unless the individual requests authorization to reproduce the record or file using equipment provided by that individual.\n\n(3) A register of deeds may prohibit the reproduction of an instrument temporarily left with the register of deeds to be recorded in the register of deeds' office.\n\n(4) Unless state or federal law, rule, regulation, or court order or rule requires that all or more than 4 sequential digits of the social security number appear in the record or file, if a record or file that contains a social security number is reproduced for or by an individual under subsection (2), the register of deeds may obscure or remove, or require that the individual obscure or remove all or at least the first 5 digits of the social security number from the reproduction before the individual removes the reproduction from the office of the register of deeds.\n\n(5) An individual whose social security number is contained in 1 or more instruments in a county's books of record may request that the register of deeds of that county obscure or remove all or at least the first 5 digits of his or her social security number from copies made of those instruments by recording an affidavit identifying the liber and page of those instruments.\n\nHistory:1875, Act 54, Imd.
