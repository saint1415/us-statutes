This exemption does not apply to a governmental subdivision of this state, except state supported colleges or universities, as to property held for charitable purposes other than or more limited or specific than its general public or corporate purposes. This act shall not apply to any nonprofit charitable corporation organized under the laws of this state whose operating funds are derived, in whole or in part, from community funds or united foundation sources but this act shall apply to such a charitable corporation as to funds or properties received by it as trustee of an inter vivos trust of a continuing nature.\n\n(b) The registration and periodic reporting requirements of this act shall not apply to any trust in which the interests of the charitable remainder beneficiaries are remote. For the purpose of this act the interests of charitable remainder beneficiaries of a trust shall be considered remote if under the maximum exercise of discretion by the trustee in favor of the charitable remainder beneficiaries of such trusts, the value of their interests in the aggregate assets, computed actuarially at 5% or less of the value of the property subject to the trust, such determination shall be made at the time of the creation of an irrevocable trust, or at the time a revocable trust becomes irrevocable, or at the death of the testator in case of a testamentary trust. When a remote charitable interest vests in present possession or enjoyment, registration and periodic reports shall be required for the first time under this act.\n\n(c) Unless the governing instrument provides otherwise, a trust, whether testamentary or inter vivos, shall not be deemed a charitable trust only for the purposes of registration, accounting and notice, in the case where the individual or individuals are the sole income beneficiaries of the trust and a charitable organization or organizations (none of which or the selection of which are under the dominion or control of the grantor, testator, executor or trustee, or any members of his family) are remaindermen, until the remainder interest of at least one charitable organization vests in enjoyment. This provision shall not apply in the case of a disputed last will and testament.\n\nHistory:1961, Act 101, Eff. Sept. 8, 1961 ;-- Am. 1965, Act 353, Eff. Mar. 31, 1966 ;-- Am. 1967, Act 295, Eff.

A judgment rendered in such proceedings without service of process and pleadings upon the attorney general, shall be voidable, unenforceable, and be set aside at the option of the attorney general upon his motion seeking such relief. The attorney general shall intervene in any proceedings affecting a charitable trust subject to this act, when requested to do so by the court having jurisdiction of the proceedings, and may intervene in any proceedings affecting a charitable trust when he determines that the public interest should be protected in such proceedings. With respect to such proceedings, no compromise, settlement agreement, contract or judgment agreed to by any or all parties having or claiming to have an interest in any charitable trust shall be valid unless the attorney general was made a party to such proceedings and joined in the compromise, settlement agreement, contract or judgment, or unless the attorney general, in writing, waives his right to participate therein. The attorney general is expressly authorized to enter into such compromise, settlement agreement, contract or judgment as in his opinion may be in the best interests of the people of the state and the uncertain or indefinite beneficiaries.\n\n(c) Whenever a petition is filed for probate of a last will and testament containing any residuary bequest or devise to a trustee, as hereinbefore defined, or if such will creates or purports to create a charitable trust, the petitioner shall serve notice upon the attorney general, charitable trust division, of the pendency of the proceedings, and the probate judge shall make available and shall forward to the attorney general a copy of the petition for probate of will and a copy of the instruments filed for admission to probate. The notice and documents shall be served by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 14 days before the hearing date. The judge of probate shall not pass upon the petition in the absence of filing of proof of mailing. Upon entering his appearance, the attorney general shall become a necessary party in interest in the estate proceedings, either in the probate court or by way of appeal.\n\n(d) The attorney general shall establish and maintain a register of charitable trusts and trustees subject to this act and of the particular trust or other relationship under which they hold property for charitable purposes and shall conduct whatever investigation is necessary, and shall obtain from public records, all courts of record, court officers, taxing authorities, trustees, and other sources, whatever information, copies of instruments, reports and records needed for the establishment and maintenance of the register and files. The attorney general shall be authorized to require the necessary information and documents, necessary to discharge the requirements of this act, and to require true or certified copies thereof to be furnished him, and all public officials shall provide same, without payment of any fee or charge whatsoever.\n\nHistory:1961, Act 101, Eff.

Whenever any trustee shall file any petition for disposition or distribution of the assets of the trust or render any account with any probate or circuit court of this state, the trustee shall mail to the attorney general by certified mail a true copy of such petition or account, together with notice of the date of hearing thereof, and file proof of such mailing thereof with the court.

He may classify charitable trusts as to purpose, nature of assets, duration of the charitable trust, amount of assets, amounts to be devoted to charitable purposes, nature of trustee, or otherwise, and may establish different rules for the different classes as to time and nature of the reports required to the ends (1) that he shall receive reasonably current, periodic reports as to all charitable trusts which will enable him to ascertain whether they are being properly administered, and (2) that periodic reports shall not unreasonably add to the expense of the administration of charitable trusts. The attorney general may suspend the filing of reports as to a particular charitable trust for a reasonable, specifically designated time upon written application of the trustee filed with the attorney general and after the attorney general has filed in the register of charitable trusts a written statement that the interests of the beneficiaries will not be prejudiced thereby and that periodic reports are not required for proper supervision by his office.\n\n(c) A copy of an account filed by the trustee in any court having jurisdiction of the charitable trust, if the account substantially complies with the rules and regulations of the attorney general, may be filed as a report required by this section.\n\n(d) The first report for a charitable trust, unless the filing thereof is suspended as herein provided, shall be filed not later than 1 year after any part of the income or principal is authorized or required to be applied to a charitable purpose.
