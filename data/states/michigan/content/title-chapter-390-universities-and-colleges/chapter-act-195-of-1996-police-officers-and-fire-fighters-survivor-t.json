For an individual who is a dependent of his or her parent, residency status shall be determined by the parent's residency. For an individual who is not a dependent, residency status is determined in the same manner as under 20 USC 1070 to 1070h.\n\n(c) The student applies to the department for a survivor's tuition grant under this act and provides evidence satisfactory to the department that he or she is an eligible student, that the course or courses for which he or she is seeking a survivor's tuition grant meet the requirements of subsection (3), and that he or she meets the other requirements of this section.\n\n(d) If the student is a child of a Michigan police officer or Michigan fire fighter who was killed in the line of duty, he or she applies for a survivor's tuition grant under subdivision (c) for the first time before the age of 26.\n\n(e) The financial aid officer at the state institution of higher education certifies to the department that the student's eligible tuition expenses exceed the total of all other gift aid available to the student; certifies the amount of that excess; and certifies that the tuition rate or rates used to determine the amount of that excess are not greater than the rate or rates charged to residents of this state.\n\n(f) The student maintains satisfactory academic progress, as defined by the state institution of higher education, for each term or semester in which he or she is enrolled. The satisfactory progress definition used by an institution for federal student assistance programs under 20 USC 1070 to 1070h is acceptable for the purposes of this act.\n\n(g) The student has not received a bachelor's degree and has received tuition assistance under this act for fewer than 124 semester credits or 180 term credits at an institution of higher education.\n\n(h) The student has not received a survivor's tuition grant in more than a total of 9 semesters or the equivalent number of terms or quarters.\n\n(3) The amount of a survivor's tuition grant in an academic year is the amount of the student's eligible tuition in that academic year less all other gift aid available to the eligible student. The department may reduce the amount of a survivor's tuition grant if it determines that the tuition rate or rates used by the state institution of higher education under subsection (2)(e) to determine the amount of the survivor's tuition grant are greater than the tuition rate or rates charged by the institution in that academic year to residents of this state.\n\nHistory:1996, Act 195, Imd.
