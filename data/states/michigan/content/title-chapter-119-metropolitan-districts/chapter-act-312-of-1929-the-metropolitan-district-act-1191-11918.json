If without its limits, the purchase must be incidental to the operation and maintenance of the public utility. A contract shall not bind the district unless the proposition on the contract shall receive the affirmative vote of 3/5 of the electors voting on the proposition at a regular or special election. In the event of any such purchase, the charter amendment and the contract to purchase shall provide for the creation of a sinking fund, into which shall be paid from time to time, from the earnings of the utility, sums sufficient to insure the payment of the purchase price and the performance of the obligations of the contract to the end that the entire cost of the public utility shall eventually be paid from its earnings. The powers in this subdivision are in addition to the other powers provided for in this act, and the exercise of these powers shall not impair or affect the right to exercise any other powers.\n\n(g) For the purchase, gift, or condemnation of private property for any public use or purpose provided for and within the scope of its power.
