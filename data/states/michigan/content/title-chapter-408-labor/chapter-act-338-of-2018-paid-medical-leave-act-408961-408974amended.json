If the employee’s need for the earned sick time is not foreseeable, an employer may require the employee to give notice of the intention as soon as practicable.\n\n(3) Earned sick time may be used in the smaller of hourly increments or the smallest increment that the employer’s payroll system uses to account for absences of use of other time.\n\n(4) For earned sick time of more than 3 consecutive days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the earned sick time has been used for a purpose described in subsection (1). Upon the employer’s request, the employee must provide the documentation to the employer in a timely manner. The employer shall not delay the commencement of earned sick time on the basis that the employer has not yet received documentation. Documentation signed by a health care professional indicating that earned sick time is necessary is reasonable documentation for purposes of this subsection. In cases of domestic violence or sexual assault, one of the following types of documentation selected by the employee shall be considered reasonable documentation: (a) a police report indicating that the employee or the employee’s family member was a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault; (b) a signed statement from a victim and witness advocate affirming that the employee or employee’s family member is receiving services from a victim services organization; or (c) a court document indicating that the employee or employee’s family member is involved in legal action related to domestic violence or sexual assault. An employer shall not require that the documentation explain the nature of the illness or the details of the violence. If an employer chooses to require documentation for earned sick time, the employer is responsible for paying all out-of-pocket expenses the employee incurs in obtaining the documentation. If the employee does have health insurance, the employer is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee by the health care provider for providing the specific documentation required by the employer.\n\n(5) An employer shall not require disclosure of details relating to domestic violence or sexual assault or the details of an employee’s or an employee’s family member’s medical condition as a condition of providing earned sick time under this act. If an employer possesses health information or information pertaining to domestic violence or sexual assault about an employee or employee’s family member, the employer shall treat that information as confidential and shall not disclose that information except to the affected employee or with the permission of the affected employee.\n\n(6) This act does not require an employer to provide earned sick time for any purposes other than as described in this section.\n\nHistory:2018, Act 338, Eff.
