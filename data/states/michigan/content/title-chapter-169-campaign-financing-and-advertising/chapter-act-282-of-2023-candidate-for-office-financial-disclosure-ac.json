Except as otherwise provided in this section, the secretary of state shall issue a declaratory ruling within 60 business days after receiving a request for a declaratory ruling. The secretary of state may refuse to issue a declaratory ruling or an interpretive statement under this act if the request is anonymous, the secretary of state determines that the subject matter of the request is frivolous on its face, or the request is indefinite or lacks specificity. If the secretary of state refuses to issue a declaratory ruling, the secretary of state shall notify the person making the request of the reasons for the refusal and issue an interpretive statement providing an informational response to the question presented within the 60-day period.

If the secretary of state determines whether there may be reason to believe that a violation of this act occurred or determines to terminate its proceedings, the secretary of state shall, within 30 days after that determination, post on the secretary of state's website any complaint, response, or rebuttal statement received under subsection (5) regarding that violation or alleged violation and any correspondence that is dispositive of that violation or alleged violation between the secretary of state and the complainant or the person against whom the complaint was filed. If the secretary of state determines there may be reason to believe that a violation of this act occurred, the secretary of state shall endeavor to correct the violation or prevent a further violation by using informal methods such as a conference, conciliation, or persuasion, and may enter into a conciliation agreement with the person involved. Unless violated, a conciliation agreement is a complete bar to any further civil action with respect to matters covered in the conciliation agreement. The secretary of state shall, within 30 days after a conciliation agreement is signed, post that agreement on the department's website.

The secretary of state shall deposit a civil fine imposed under this act in the general fund. The secretary of state may bring an action in circuit court to recover the amount of a civil fine.\n\n(12) The secretary of state shall review a report or statement filed under this act and may investigate an apparent violation of this act. If the secretary of state determines that there may be reason to believe a violation of this act occurred and the procedures prescribed in subsection (9) have been complied with, the secretary of state may commence a hearing under subsection (10) to determine whether a violation of this act occurred.\n\n(13) There is no private right of action, either in law or in equity, under this act. The remedies provided in this act are the exclusive means by which this act may be enforced and by which any harm resulting from a violation of this act may be redressed.\n\n(14) The secretary of state shall preserve a report filed under this act for 15 years after the date the report is filed. If the secretary of state or attorney general determines under this section that a violation of this act occurred, the secretary of state shall preserve all complaints, orders, decisions, or other documents related to that violation for 15 years after the date of the determination or the date the violation is corrected, whichever is later. Reports filed under this act may be reproduced under the records reproduction act, 1992 PA 116, MCL 24.401 to 24.406. After the required preservation period, the reports, or the reproductions of the reports, may be disposed of in the manner prescribed in the management and budget act, 1984 PA 431, MCL 18.1101 to 18.1594, and section 11 of the Michigan history center act, 2016 PA 470, MCL 399.811.\n\nHistory:2023, Act 282, Eff.
