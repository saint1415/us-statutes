      "text": "(1) The Michigan indigent defense commission is established within the department.\n\n(2) The MIDC is an autonomous entity within the department. Except as otherwise provided by law, the MIDC shall exercise its statutory powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities independently of the department. The department shall provide support and coordinated services as requested by the MIDC including providing personnel, budgeting, procurement, and other administrative support to the MIDC sufficient to carry out its duties, powers, and responsibilities.\n\n(3) The MIDC shall propose minimum standards for the local delivery of indigent criminal defense services providing effective assistance of counsel to adults throughout this state. These minimum standards must be designed to ensure the provision of indigent criminal defense services that meet constitutional requirements for effective assistance of counsel. However, these minimum standards must not infringe on the supreme court's authority over practice and procedure in the courts of this state as set forth in section 5 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963.\n\n(4) The commission shall convene a public hearing before a proposed standard is recommended to the department. A minimum standard proposed under this subsection must be submitted to the department for approval or rejection. Opposition to a proposed minimum standard may be submitted to the department in a manner prescribed by the department. An indigent criminal defense system that objects to a recommended minimum standard on the ground that the recommended minimum standard would exceed the MIDC's statutory authority shall state specifically how the recommended minimum standard would exceed the MIDC's statutory authority. A proposed minimum standard is final when it is approved by the department. A minimum standard that is approved by the department is not subject to challenge through the appellate procedures in section 15. An approved minimum standard for the local delivery of indigent criminal defense services within an indigent criminal defense system is not a rule as that term is defined in section 7 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.207.\n\n(5) Approval of a minimum standard proposed by the MIDC is considered a final department action subject to judicial review under section 28 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963 to determine whether the approved minimum standard is authorized by law. Jurisdiction and venue for judicial review are vested in the court of claims. An indigent criminal defense system may file a petition for review in the court of claims within 60 days after the date of mailing notice of the department's final decision on the recommended minimum standard. The filing of a petition for review does not stay enforcement of an approved minimum standard, but the department may grant, or the court of claims may order, a stay upon appropriate terms.\n\n(6) The MIDC shall identify and encourage best practices for delivering the effective assistance of counsel to indigent defendants charged with crimes.\n\n(7) The MIDC shall identify and implement a system of performance metrics to assess the provision of indigent defense services in this state relative to national standards and benchmarks. The MIDC shall provide an annual report to the governor, legislature, supreme court, and the state budget director on the performance metrics not later than December 15 of each year.\n\nHistory:2013, Act 93, Imd.

However, if the senate majority leader or the speaker of the house of representatives is the source of the nomination, 1 name must be submitted.

      "text": "(1) The MIDC shall establish minimum standards, rules, and procedures to effectuate the following:\n\n(a) The delivery of indigent criminal defense services must be independent of the judiciary but ensure that the judges of this state are permitted and encouraged to contribute information and advice concerning that delivery of indigent criminal defense services.\n\n(b) If the caseload is sufficiently high, indigent criminal defense services may consist of both an indigent criminal defender office and the active participation of other members of the state bar.\n\n(c) Trial courts shall assure that each criminal defendant is advised of his or her right to counsel. All adults, except those appearing with retained counsel or those who have made an informed waiver of counsel, must be screened for eligibility under this act, and counsel must be assigned as soon as an indigent adult is determined to be eligible for indigent criminal defense services.\n\n(2) The MIDC shall implement minimum standards, rules, and procedures to guarantee the right of indigent defendants to the assistance of counsel as provided under amendment VI of the Constitution of the United States and section 20 of article I of the state constitution of 1963. In establishing minimum standards, rules, and procedures, the MIDC shall adhere to the following principles:\n\n(a) Defense counsel is provided sufficient time and a space where attorney-client confidentiality is safeguarded for meetings with defense counsel's client.\n\n(b) Defense counsel's workload is controlled to permit effective representation. Economic disincentives or incentives that impair defense counsel's ability to provide effective representation must be avoided. The MIDC may develop workload controls to enhance defense counsel's ability to provide effective representation.\n\n(c) Defense counsel's ability, training, and experience match the nature and complexity of the case to which he or she is appointed.\n\n(d) The same defense counsel continuously represents and personally appears at every court appearance throughout the pendency of the case. However, indigent criminal defense systems may exempt ministerial, nonsubstantive tasks, and hearings from this prescription.\n\n(e) Indigent criminal defense systems employ only defense counsel who have attended continuing legal education relevant to counsels' indigent defense clients.\n\n(f) Indigent criminal defense systems systematically review defense counsel at the local level for efficiency and for effective representation according to MIDC standards.\n\n(3) The following requirements apply to the application for, and appointment of, indigent criminal defense services under this act:\n\n(a) A preliminary inquiry regarding, and the determination of, the indigency of any defendant, including a determination regarding whether a defendant is partially indigent, for purposes of this act must be made as determined by the indigent criminal defense system not later than at the defendant's first appearance in court. The determination may be reviewed by the indigent criminal defense system at any other stage of the proceedings. In determining whether a defendant is entitled to the appointment of counsel, the indigent criminal defense system shall consider whether the defendant is indigent and the extent of his or her ability to pay. Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, income or funds from employment or any other source, including personal public assistance, to which the defendant is entitled, property owned by the defendant or in which he or she has an economic interest, outstanding obligations, the number and ages of the defendant's dependents, employment and job training history, and his or her level of education. A trial court may play a role in this determination as part of any indigent criminal defense system's compliance plan under the direction and supervision of the supreme court, consistent with section 4 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963. If an indigent criminal defense system determines that a defendant is partially indigent, the indigent criminal defense system shall determine the amount of money the defendant must contribute to his or her defense. An indigent criminal defense system's determination regarding the amount of money a partially indigent defendant must contribute to his or her defense is subject to judicial review. Nothing in this act prevents a court from making a determination of indigency for any purpose consistent with article VI of the state constitution of 1963.\n\n(b) A defendant is considered to be indigent if he or she is unable, without substantial financial hardship to himself or herself or to his or her dependents, to obtain competent, qualified legal representation on his or her own. Substantial financial hardship is rebuttably presumed if the defendant receives personal public assistance, including under the food assistance program, temporary assistance for needy families, Medicaid, or disability insurance, resides in public housing, or earns an income less than 140% of the federal poverty guideline. A defendant is also rebuttably presumed to have a substantial financial hardship if he or she is currently serving a sentence in a correctional institution or is receiving residential treatment in a mental health or substance abuse facility.\n\n(c) A defendant not falling below the presumptive thresholds described in subdivision (b) must be subjected to a more rigorous screening process to determine if his or her particular circumstances, including the seriousness of the charges being faced, his or her monthly expenses, and local private counsel rates would result in a substantial hardship if he or she were required to retain private counsel.\n\n(d) A determination that a defendant is partially indigent may only be made if the indigent criminal defense system determines that a defendant is not fully indigent. An indigent criminal defense system that determines a defendant is not fully indigent but may be partially indigent must utilize the screening process under subdivision (c). The provisions of subdivision (e) apply to a partially indigent defendant.\n\n(e) The MIDC shall promulgate objective standards for indigent criminal defense systems to determine whether a defendant is indigent or partially indigent. These standards must include availability of prompt judicial review, under the direction and supervision of the supreme court, if the indigent criminal defense system is making the determination regarding a defendant's indigency or partial indigency.\n\n(f) The MIDC shall promulgate objective standards for indigent criminal defense systems to determine the amount a partially indigent defendant must contribute to his or her defense. The standards must include availability of prompt judicial review, under the direction and supervision of the supreme court, if the indigent criminal defense system is making the determination regarding how much a partially indigent defendant must contribute to his or her defense.\n\n(g) A defendant is responsible for applying for indigent defense counsel and for establishing his or her indigency and eligibility for appointed counsel under this act. Any oral or written statements made by the defendant in or for use in the criminal proceeding and material to the issue of his or her indigency must be made under oath or an equivalent affirmation.\n\n(4) The MIDC shall establish standards for trainers and organizations conducting training that receive MIDC funds for training and education. The standards established under this subsection must require that the MIDC analyze the quality of the training, and must require that the effectiveness of the training be capable of being measured and validated.\n\n(5) An indigent criminal defense system may include in its compliance plan a request that the MIDC serve as a clearinghouse for experts and investigators. If an indigent criminal defense system makes a request under this subsection, the MIDC may develop and operate a system for determining the need and availability for an expert or investigator in individual cases.\n\nHistory:2013, Act 93, Imd.

A plan submitted under this subsection must specifically address how the minimum standards established by the MIDC under this act will be met and must include a cost analysis for meeting those minimum standards. The standards to be addressed in the annual plan are those approved not less than 180 days before the annual plan submission date.

If the MIDC disapproves any part of the plan, the cost analysis, or both the plan and the cost analysis, the indigent criminal defense system shall consult with the MIDC and, for any disapproved portion, submit a new plan, a new cost analysis, or both within 60 calendar days of the mailing date of the official notification of the MIDC's disapproval. If after 3 submissions a compromise is not reached, the dispute must be resolved as provided in section 15. All approved provisions of an indigent criminal defense system's plan and cost analysis must not be delayed by any disapproved portion and must proceed as provided in this act. The MIDC shall not approve a cost analysis or portion of a cost analysis unless it is reasonably and directly related to an indigent defense function.\n\n(5) The MIDC shall submit a report to the governor, the senate majority leader, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the appropriations committees of the senate and house of representatives requesting the appropriation of funds necessary to implement compliance plans after all the systems compliance plans are approved by the MIDC. For standards approved after January 1, 2018, the MIDC shall include a cost analysis for each minimum standard in the report and shall also provide a cost analysis for each minimum standard approved on or before January 1, 2018, if a cost analysis for each minimum standard approved was not provided and shall do so not later than October 31, 2018. The amount requested under this subsection must be equal to the total amount required to achieve full compliance as agreed upon by the MIDC and the indigent criminal defense systems under the approval process provided in subsection (4). The information used to create this report must be made available to the governor, the senate majority leader, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the appropriations committees of the senate and house of representatives.\n\n(6) The MIDC shall submit a report to the governor, the senate majority leader, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the appropriations committees of the senate and house of representatives not later than October 31, 2021 that includes a recommendation regarding the appropriate level of local share, expressed in both total dollars and as a percentage of the total cost of compliance for each indigent criminal defense system.\n\n(7) Except as provided in subsection (9), an indigent criminal defense system shall maintain not less than its local share. If the MIDC determines that funding in excess of the indigent criminal defense system's share is necessary in order to bring its system into compliance with the minimum standards established by the MIDC, that excess funding must be paid by this state. The legislature shall appropriate to the MIDC the additional funds necessary for a system to meet and maintain those minimum standards, which must be provided to indigent criminal defense systems through grants as described in subsection (8). The legislature may appropriate funds that apply to less than all of the minimum standards and may provide less than the full amount of the funds requested under subsection (5). Notwithstanding this subsection, it is the intent of the legislature to fund all of the minimum standards contained in the report under subsection (5) within 3 years of the date on which the minimum standards were adopted.\n\n(8) An indigent criminal defense system must not be required to provide funds in excess of its local share. The MIDC shall provide grants to indigent criminal defense systems to assist in bringing the systems into compliance with minimum standards established by the MIDC.\n\n(9) An indigent criminal defense system is not required to expend its local share if the minimum standards established by the MIDC may be met for less than that share, but the local share of a system that expends less than its local share under these circumstances is not reduced by the lower expenditure.\n\n(10) This state shall appropriate funds to the MIDC for grants to the local units of government for the reasonable costs associated with data required to be collected under this act that is over and above the local unit of government's data costs for other purposes.\n\n(11) Within 180 days after receiving funds from the MIDC under subsection (8), an indigent criminal defense system shall comply with the terms of the grant in bringing its system into compliance with the minimum standards established by the MIDC for effective assistance of counsel. The terms of a grant may allow an indigent criminal defense system to exceed 180 days for compliance with a specific item needed to meet minimum standards if necessity is demonstrated in the indigent criminal defense system's compliance plan. The MIDC has the authority to allow an indigent criminal defense system to exceed 180 days for implementation of items if an unforeseeable condition prohibits timely compliance.\n\n(12) If an indigent criminal defense system is awarded no funds for implementation of its plan under this act, the MIDC shall nevertheless issue to the system a zero grant reflecting that it will receive no grant funds.\n\n(13) The MIDC may apply for and obtain grants from any source to carry out the purposes of this act. All funds received by MIDC, from any source, are state funds and must be appropriated as provided by law.\n\n(14) The MIDC shall ensure proper financial protocols in administering and overseeing funds utilized by indigent criminal defense systems, including, but not limited to, all of the following:\n\n(a) Requiring documentation of expenditures.\n\n(b) Requiring each indigent criminal defense system to hold all grant funds in a fund that is separate from other funds held by the indigent criminal defense system.\n\n(c) Requiring each indigent criminal defense system to comply with the standards promulgated by the governmental accounting standards board.\n\n(15) If an indigent criminal defense system does not fully expend a grant toward its costs of compliance, its grant in the second succeeding fiscal year must be reduced by the amount equal to the unexpended funds. Identified unexpended grant funds must be reported by indigent criminal defense systems on or before October 31 of each year. Funds subject to extension under subsection (11) must be reported but not included in the reductions described in this subsection. Any grant money that is determined to have been used for a purpose outside of the compliance plan must be repaid to the MIDC, or if not repaid, must be deducted from future grant amounts.\n\n(16) If an indigent criminal defense system expends funds in excess of its local share and the approved MIDC grant to meet unexpected needs in the provision of indigent criminal defense services, the MIDC shall recommend the inclusion of the funds in a subsequent year's grant if all expenditures were reasonably and directly related to indigent criminal defense functions.\n\n(17) The court shall collect contribution or reimbursement from individuals determined to be partially indigent under applicable court rules and statutes. Reimbursement under this subsection is subject to section 22 of chapter XV of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 775.22. The court shall remit 100% of the funds it collects under this subsection to the indigent criminal defense system in which the court is sitting. Twenty percent of the funds received under this subsection by an indigent criminal defense system must be remitted to the department in a manner prescribed by the department and reported to the MIDC by October 31 of each year. The funds received by the department under this subsection must be expended by the MIDC in support of indigent criminal defense systems in this state. The remaining 80% of the funds collected under this subsection may be retained by the indigent criminal defense system for purposes of reimbursing the costs of collecting the funds under this subsection and funding indigent defense in the subsequent fiscal year. The funds collected under this subsection must not alter the calculation of the local share made pursuant to section 3(i).\n\nHistory:2013, Act 93, Imd. Eff. July 1, 2013 ;-- Am. 2016, Act 441, Imd.

The state court administrator, as authorized by the supreme court, shall appoint a mediator agreed to by the parties within 30 calendar days of the mailing date of the official notification of the third disapproval by the MIDC under section 13(4) to mediate the dispute and shall facilitate the mediation process. The MIDC shall immediately send the state court administrative office a copy of the official notice of that third disapproval. If the parties do not agree on the selection of the mediator, the state court administrator, as authorized by the supreme court, shall appoint a mediator of his or her choosing. Mediation must commence within 30 calendar days after the mediator is appointed and terminate within 60 calendar days of its commencement. Mediation costs associated with mediation of the dispute must be paid equally by the parties.\n\n(2) If the parties do not come to a resolution of the dispute during mediation under subsection (1), all of the following apply:\n\n(a) The mediator may submit his or her recommendation of how the dispute should be resolved to the MIDC within 30 calendar days of the conclusion of mediation for the MIDC's consideration.\n\n(b) The MIDC shall consider the recommendation of the mediator, if any, and shall approve a final plan or the cost analysis, or both, in the manner the MIDC considers appropriate within 30 calendar days, and the indigent criminal defense system shall implement the plan as approved by the MIDC.\n\n(c) The indigent criminal defense system that is aggrieved by the final plan, cost analysis, or both, may bring an action seeking equitable relief as described in subsection (3).\n\n(3) The MIDC, or an indigent criminal defense system may bring an action seeking equitable relief in the circuit court only as follows:\n\n(a) Within 60 days after the MIDC's issuance of an approved plan and cost analysis under subsection (2)(b).\n\n(b) Within 60 days after the system receives grant funds under section 13(8), if the plan, cost analysis, or both, required a grant award for implementation of the plan.\n\n(c) Within 30 days of the MIDC's determination that the indigent criminal defense system has breached its duty to comply with an approved plan.\n\n(d) The action must be brought in the judicial circuit where the indigent criminal defense service is located. The state court administrator, as authorized by the supreme court, shall assign an active or retired judge from a judicial circuit other than the judicial circuit where the action was filed to hear the case. Costs associated with the assignment of the judge must be paid equally by the parties.\n\n(e) The action must not challenge the validity, legality, or appropriateness of the minimum standards approved by the department.\n\n(4) If the dispute involves the indigent criminal defense system's plan, cost analysis, or both, the court may approve, reject, or modify the submitted plan, cost analysis, or the terms of a grant awarded under section 13(8) other than the amount of the grant, determine whether section 13 has been complied with, and issue any orders necessary to obtain compliance with this act. However, the system must not be required to expend more than its local share in complying with this act.\n\n(5) If a party refuses or fails to comply with a previous order of the court, the court may enforce the previous order through the court's enforcement remedies, including, but not limited to, its contempt powers, and may order that the state undertake the provision of indigent criminal defense services in lieu of the indigent criminal defense system.\n\n(6) If the court determines that an indigent criminal defense system has breached its duty under section 17(1), the court may order the MIDC to provide indigent criminal defense on behalf of that system.\n\n(7) If the court orders the MIDC to provide indigent criminal defense services on behalf of an indigent criminal defense system, the court shall order the system to pay the following amount of the state's costs that the MIDC determines are necessary in order to bring the indigent criminal defense system into compliance with the minimum standards established by the MIDC:\n\n(a) In the first year, 20% of the state's costs.\n\n(b) In the second year, 40% of the state's costs.\n\n(c) In the third year, 60% of the state's costs.\n\n(d) In the fourth year, 80% of the state's costs.\n\n(e) In the fifth year, and any subsequent year, not more than the dollar amount that was calculated under subdivision (d).\n\n(8) An indigent criminal defense system may resume providing indigent criminal defense services at any time as provided under section 13. When a system resumes providing indigent criminal defense services, it is no longer required to pay an assessment under subsection (7) but must be required to pay no less than its share.\n\nHistory:2013, Act 93, Imd.
