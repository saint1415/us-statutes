No. 1997-9, Eff. Sept. 6, 1997Compiler's Notes:In the third paragraph of this section, the phrase “Act No. 223 of the Public of 1976” evidently should read “Act No. 223 of the Public Acts of 1976.”In the paragraph numbered “5.”, the phrase “for the reminder of the fiscal year” evidently should read “for the remainder of the fiscal year.”",
