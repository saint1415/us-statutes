If the lender determines that the proposed buyer or transferee meets the lender's customary credit standards, the lender may charge the proposed buyer or transferee a loan processing fee in connection with and to be paid at the time of the amendment to the loan contract as provided in section 4. The total amount of the fees permitted by this subsection shall not exceed 1/2 of 1% of the outstanding balance of the residential window period loan plus the actual cost of an endorsement to the lender's policy of title insurance plus the actual cost of transfer of any private mortgage insurance. Other than the fees provided by this subsection, a lender shall not charge any amount for any reason for a transaction governed by sections 3 to 5.\n\n(3) Except as provided in section 6, a lender may enforce a due-on-sale clause in a residential window period loan if any of the following apply:\n\n(a) The borrower and the proposed buyer or transferee fail to follow in a timely manner the procedures set forth in subsection (1).\n\n(b) The proposed buyer or transferee fails to timely pay a fee charged by the lender under subsection (2).\n\n(c) The lender, in good faith and in accordance with its customary procedures for evaluating creditworthiness, determines that the proposed buyer or transferee does not meet the lender's customary credit standards.\n\n(d) Enforcement is justified by a threat to a legitimate interest of the lender, which includes preventing the impairment or loss of the lender's security.\n\n(4) A lender shall not enforce a due-on-sale clause under either this section or section 4 in a residential window period loan if the lender fails to follow in a timely manner the procedures set forth in subsection (1).\n\nHistory:1984, Act 351, Eff.

At the end of the blended rate period, the monthly payments of principal and interest shall be adjusted to an amount sufficient to repay the loan plus interest on the balance outstanding from time to time at the rate effective after the blended rate period in equal monthly payments over the remaining original amortization period for the loan.\n\n(4) If the borrower accepts an offer by a lender to amend a loan as provided in subsection (1), the amendment shall be executed and delivered at or before the sale or transfer, and shall be effective beginning on the date of the sale or transfer. If for reasons other than acts of the lender the amendment is not executed and delivered before the sale or transfer, then upon consummation of a sale or transfer the lender may enforce a due-on-sale clause.
