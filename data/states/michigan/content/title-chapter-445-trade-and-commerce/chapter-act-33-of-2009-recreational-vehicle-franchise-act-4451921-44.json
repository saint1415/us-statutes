The demand for mediation shall include a brief statement of the dispute and the relief sought by the party making the demand.

If a complaint, petition, protest, or other action is filed before that meeting, the court shall enter an order suspending the proceeding or action until the mediation meeting has occurred and may, if all of the parties to the proceeding or action stipulate in writing that they wish to continue to mediate under this section, enter an order suspending the proceeding or action for as long a period as the court considers appropriate. The court may modify, extend, or revoke a suspension order issued under this subsection if it considers that action appropriate.\n\n(6) Each of the parties to the mediation under this section is responsible for its own attorney fees.
