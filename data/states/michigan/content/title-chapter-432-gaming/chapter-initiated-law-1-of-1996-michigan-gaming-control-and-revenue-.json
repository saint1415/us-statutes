If the board determines that a casino licensee that makes an application under this subsection has been fully operational and in compliance with its development agreement that is in existence on July 1, 2004 or a subsequent original development agreement, for at least 30 consecutive days, the board shall certify the casino licensee under this subsection, and the tax imposed on the casino licensee under subsection (5), as adjusted, if applicable, by subsection (6), shall be, retroactive to the first day of the 30 consecutive day period that the casino licensee was fully operational, reduced to 1% and must be allocated entirely to the city where the licensee operates its casino.\n\n(8) If the McCauley-Traxler-Law-Bowman-McNeely lottery act, 1972 PA 239, MCL 432.1 to 432.47, is amended to allow the operation of video lottery at horse racetracks in this state, and if video lottery is being conducted at horse racetracks in this state, the casino licensee is no longer obligated to pay the wagering tax under subsections (5) to (7).\n\n(9) Notwithstanding section 9b, if the McCauley-Traxler-Law-Bowman-McNeely lottery act, 1972 PA 239, MCL 432.1 to 432.47, is amended to allow the operation of video lottery at horse racetracks in this state, and if video lottery is being conducted at horse racetracks in this state, a casino licensee may, after obtaining approval from the board, apply to the racing commissioner for authorization to simulcast horse races under the horse racing law of 1995, 1995 PA 279, MCL 431.301 to 431.336.

Simulcasting and wagering under this subsection are under the primary control of the racing commissioner, and the racing commissioner may revoke or suspend the authorization of or take other disciplinary action against the casino licensee for failing to comply with a law, rule, permit, or order as required by this subsection. However, the simulcasting and wagering under this subsection is part of the licensee's casino operation under this act and subject to the same control by the board as are other parts of the licensee's casino operation. The board may take disciplinary action under section 4a against a casino licensee for failure to comply with a law, rule, permit, or order as required by this subsection.\n\n(10) A casino licensee is entitled to the same commission from money wagered on horse races simulcast by the licensee as a race meeting licensee is entitled to receive from wagering on simulcast horse races under the horse racing law of 1995, 1995 PA 279, MCL 431.301 to 431.336. The same taxes, fees, and other deductions must be subtracted and paid from the licensee's commission as are subtracted and paid from a race meeting licensee's commission under the horse racing law of 1995, 1995 PA 279, MCL 431.301 to 431.336.\n\n(11) Payments to a city under 1 of the methods in subsection (4) must be made in a manner, at those times, and subject to reporting requirements and penalties and interest for delinquent payment as may be provided for in the development agreement if the payment is required under a development agreement, or by ordinance if the payment is required for a tax levied by the city.

Payments to a city under the method described in subsection (4) must be used by the city for the purposes listed in subsection (3)(a).\n\n(12) Approval by the city of a development agreement or adoption of an ordinance approving either casino gaming or the levy of a local excise tax does not constitute the granting of a franchise or license by the city for purposes of any statutory, charter, or constitutional provision.\n\n(13) The taxes imposed under this section and any tax imposed under section 13(2) must be administered by the department of treasury in accordance with 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and this act. In case of conflict between the provisions of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and this act, the provisions of this act prevail.\n\n(14) Funds from this act must not be used to supplant existing state appropriations or local expenditures.\n\n(15) If internet sports betting or other forms of internet gaming are authorized and regulated by other laws of this state, any taxes, payments, and fees relating to such internet wagers received by a casino licensee and such internet gaming are subject to those other laws of this state.\n\n(16) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (15), and in lieu of the taxes and fees that otherwise would be imposed under this act on sports betting, a wagering tax of 8.4% is imposed on the qualified adjusted gross receipts received by a casino licensee from any form of sports betting conducted under this act. Wagering taxes paid under this subsection must be allocated as provided in subsection (3).

All information provided under this section is confidential and proprietary and is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.\n\n(20) This section does not impair the contractual rights under an existing development agreement between a city and a casino licensee.\n\n(21) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Fully operational\" means that a certificate of occupancy has been issued to the casino licensee for the operation of a hotel with not fewer than 400 guest rooms and, after issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the casino licensee's casino, casino enterprise, and 400-guest-room hotel have been opened and made available for public use at their permanent location and maintained in that status.\n\n(b) \"Michigan agriculture equine industry development fund\" means the Michigan agriculture equine industry development fund created in section 20 of the horse racing law of 1995, 1995 PA 279, MCL 431.320.\n\nHistory:1996, Initiated Law 1, Eff.

Such reports shall be available for examination and inspection by any creditor or party in interest and, in addition, the board may direct that copies of the reports be mailed to designated creditors or other persons and that summaries of any reports be published in designated newspapers of general circulation.\n\nHistory:Add. 1997, Act 69, Imd.
