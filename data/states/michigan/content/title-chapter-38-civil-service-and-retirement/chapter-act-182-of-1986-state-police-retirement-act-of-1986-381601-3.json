The interest rate must equal the actuarially assumed rate of investment return for the state fiscal year in which payment is made.\n\n(4) For each fiscal year that begins on or after October 1, 2003, if the actuarial valuation prepared under this section for each fiscal year demonstrates that as of the beginning of a fiscal year, and after all credits and transfers required by this act for the previous fiscal year have been made, the sum of the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions exceeds the actuarial present value of benefits, the amount based on the annual level percent of payroll contribution rate under subsections (1) and (2) may be deposited into the health advance funding subaccount created by section 42.\n\n(5) Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2022 until the pension and retiree health care payroll growth assumption rate is zero, the payroll growth assumption rate must be reduced by 50 basis points. Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, the office of retirement services within the department of technology, management, and budget and the retirement board may agree to reduce the rate described in this subsection by any number of additional basis points.\n\n(6) Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the normal cost contribution rate must not be less than the normal cost contribution rate in the immediately preceding fiscal year. Additionally, the employer portion of the contribution rate must not be less than the employer portion of the contribution rate in the immediately preceding fiscal year.\n\n(7) Subject to this subsection, beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and for each subsequent fiscal year until the unfunded actuarial accrued liability is paid off, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution sum and due payable must not be less than the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution sum and due payable in the immediately preceding fiscal year. The unfunded actuarial accrued liability must be paid off no later than September 30, 2038. Additionally, the employer portion of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution sum and due payable must not be less than the employer portion of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution sum and due payable in the immediately preceding fiscal year.\n\n(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if the retirement board establishes an arrangement and fund as described in section 6 of the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1686, the benefits that are required to be paid from that fund must be paid from a portion of the employer contributions described in this section or other eligible funds.

      "text": "(1) This section is enacted under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, that imposes certain administrative requirements and benefit limitations for qualified governmental plans. This state intends that the retirement system be a qualified pension plan created in trust under section 401 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, and that the trust be an exempt organization under section 501 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501. The department shall administer the retirement system to fulfill this intent.\n\n(2) The retirement system must be administered in compliance with section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to governmental plans and, beginning January 1, 2010, applicable provisions of the final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on April 5, 2007. Employer-financed benefits provided by the retirement system under this act must not exceed the applicable limitations set forth in section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue under section 415(d) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, to reflect cost of living increases, and the retirement system must adjust the benefits, including benefits payable to retirants and retirement allowance beneficiaries, subject to the limitation each calendar year to conform with the adjusted limitation. For purposes of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, the applicable limitation applies to aggregated benefits received from all qualified pension plans for which the office of retirement services coordinates administration of that limitation. If there is a conflict between this section and another section of this act, this section prevails.\n\n(3) The assets of the retirement system must be held in trust and invested for the sole purpose of meeting the legitimate obligations of the retirement system and must not be used for any other purpose. The assets must not be used for or diverted to a purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members, deferred members, retirants, and beneficiaries before satisfaction of all retirement system liabilities.\n\n(4) The retirement system shall return post-tax member contributions made by a member and received by the retirement system to a member upon retirement, pursuant to Internal Revenue Service regulations and approved Internal Revenue Service exclusion ratio tables.\n\n(5) The required beginning date for retirement allowances and other distributions must not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70-1/2 or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires. The required minimum distribution requirements imposed by section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, apply to this act and must be administered in accordance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the required minimum distribution requirements for all years to which the required minimum distribution requirements apply to this act.\n\n(6) If the retirement system is terminated, the interest of the members, deferred members, retirants, and beneficiaries in the retirement system is nonforfeitable to the extent funded as described in section 411(d)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 411, and related internal revenue service regulations applicable to governmental plans.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary that would limit a distributee's election under this act, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the retirement board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Beginning October 1, 2010, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have any portion of an amount payable under this act that is an eligible rollover distribution treated as a direct rollover that will be paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 408, that is established for the purpose of receiving a distribution on behalf of the beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity pursuant to section 402(c)(11) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 402.\n\n(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the compensation of a member of the retirement system must be taken into account for any year under the retirement system only to the extent that it does not exceed the compensation limit established in section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue. This subsection applies to any person who first becomes a member of the retirement system on or after October 1, 1996.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided under the retirement system in accordance with section 414(u) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 414. This subsection applies to all qualified military service on or after December 12, 1994. Effective January 1, 2007, in accordance with section 401(a)(37) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, if a member dies while performing qualified military service for purposes of determining any death benefits payable under this act, the member is treated as having resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.\n\nHistory:Add. 1995, Act 192, Imd.

An appeal must be in writing and filed with the retirement board within 30 days after receipt of the order of retirement.

The amount of retirement allowance under subdivision (b), (c), or (d) is the actuarial equivalent of the amount of retirement allowance under subdivision (a). The options are as follows:\n\n(a) The retirant will be paid a straight retirement allowance for life computed under section 24. An additional retirement allowance payment will not be made on the retirant's death.\n\n(b) The retirant will be paid a reduced retirement allowance for life with a provision that on the retirant's death, payment of the reduced retirement allowance will be continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member or deferred member designated in a writing filed with the retirement board at the time of election of this option. A member or deferred member may elect this option and designate a retirement allowance beneficiary under the conditions set forth in subsection (5).\n\n(c) A retirant must be paid a reduced retirement allowance for life with the provision that on the retirant's death, payment of 1/2 of the reduced retirement allowance is continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member designated in a writing filed with the retirement board at the time of election of the option.\n\n(d) A retirant must be paid a reduced retirement allowance for life with the provision that on the retirant's death, payment of 75% of the reduced retirement allowance is continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member designated in a writing filed with the retirement board at the time of election of the option.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the retirement allowance beneficiary selected under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) must not be changed on or after the effective date of the retirement allowance and must be either a spouse, brother, sister, parent, or child, including an adopted child, of the member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member entitled to make the election under this act. Another retirement allowance beneficiary must not be selected. If a member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the retirement allowance effective date, an election under subsection (4), other than an election under subsection (4)(b), naming the spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary, is not effective unless the election is signed by the spouse, except that this requirement may be waived by the board if the signature of a spouse cannot be obtained because of extenuating circumstances. For purposes of this subsection, \"spouse\" means the individual to whom the member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the retirement allowance effective date. Payment to a retirement allowance beneficiary must start the first day of the month following the retirant's death.\n\n(6) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (9), if the retirement allowance beneficiary selected under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) predeceases the retirant, the retirant's benefit must revert to a straight retirement allowance including postretirement adjustments, if any; is effective the first of the month following the death; and must be paid during the remainder of the retirant's life.\n\n(7) If a retirant receiving a reduced retirement allowance under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) is divorced from the spouse who had been designated as the retirant's retirement allowance beneficiary under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d), the election of a reduced retirement allowance payment option is considered void by the retirement system if the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1681 to 38.1689, and dated after June 27, 1991 provides that the election of a reduced retirement allowance payment option under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) is to be considered void by the retirement system and the retirant provides a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, to the retirement system. If the election of a reduced retirement allowance payment option under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) is considered void by the retirement system under this subsection, the retirant's retirement allowance must revert to a straight retirement allowance, including postretirement adjustments, if any, subject to an award or order of the court as described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1681 to 38.1689. The retirement allowance must revert to a straight retirement allowance under this subsection effective the first of the month after the date the retirement system receives a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court. This subsection does not supersede a judgment of divorce or award or order of the court in effect on June 27, 1991. This subsection does not require the retirement system to distribute or pay retirement assets on behalf of a retirant in an amount that exceeds the actuarially determined amount that would otherwise become payable if a judgment of divorce had not been rendered.\n\n(8) A retirant, who is divorced after payment of his or her retirement allowance begins and whose former spouse is his or her retirement allowance beneficiary, may change his or her survivor option to the straight life option only if an order of the court states that the election of a survivor option under subsection (4) is considered void by the retirement system. A retirant who subsequently remarries may elect a survivor retirement allowance option for his or her spouse of 100%, 75%, or 50% of his or her actuarially reduced monthly payments, unless otherwise precluded by court order.\n\n(9) If the retirement allowance payments terminate before an aggregate amount equal to the retirant's accumulated contributions has been paid, the difference between the retirant's accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments made must be paid to the person designated in a writing filed with the retirement board on a form provided by the retirement board. If the designated person does not survive the retirant or retirement allowance beneficiary, the difference must be paid to the deceased recipient's estate or to the legal representative of the deceased recipient.\n\n(10) A retirant who selected a retirement allowance beneficiary under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) may change his or her retirement allowance beneficiary if all of the following apply:\n\n(a) The first retirement allowance beneficiary is a spouse.\n\n(b) The first retirement allowance beneficiary predeceases the retirant after the retirement allowance effective date.\n\n(c) The retirant marries another spouse after the retirement allowance effective date.\n\n(d) Except as otherwise provided in an applicable collective bargaining agreement, the retirant files a written request with the retirement system to name his or her current spouse as a retirement allowance beneficiary not earlier than 180 days and not later than 1 year after the marriage of the retirant and the current spouse, except that a retirant whose first retirement allowance beneficiary predeceases the retirant after the retirement allowance effective date and before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection has 180 days from the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection to file a written request with the retirement system.\n\n(11) A retirant who was not married on his or her retirement allowance effective date and who did not select a payment option provided in this section may select an optional form of benefit payment under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) and designate a retirement allowance beneficiary subject to all of the following:\n\n(a) The retirant marries after his or her retirement allowance effective date.\n\n(b) The retirement allowance beneficiary is the retirant's spouse.\n\n(c) The retirement allowance beneficiary is only designated as the retirement allowance beneficiary for that portion of the retirant's retirement allowance that is not subject to an eligible domestic relations order assigning a previous spouse a reduced benefit under section 4(b) of the eligible domestic relations order act, 1991 PA 46, MCL 38.1704.\n\n(d) Except as otherwise provided in an applicable collective bargaining agreement, the retirant files a written request with the retirement system to select the optional form of benefit payment under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) and to designate his or her spouse as the retirement allowance beneficiary, not earlier than 180 days and not later than 1 year after the retirant's marriage except that a retirant who marries after the retirement allowance effective date and before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection has 180 days from the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection to file a written request with the retirement system.\n\n(e) A spouse who is added as a survivor under this subsection is not eligible for the payment of insurance premiums under section 42.\n\n(12) The retirement allowance of the retirant who makes an election under subsection (10) or (11) must not be greater than the actuarial equivalent of the retirement allowance as determined by the retirement board that the retirant would otherwise be entitled to under subsection (4)(a) and must become effective the first day of the month following the filing of the written request with the retirement system.\n\n(13) For purposes of determining actuarial equivalent retirement allowances under this section, the actuarially assumed interest rate is determined by the director of the department and the retirement board in consultation with the actuary with utilization of the mortality tables adopted by the department and the retirement board.\n\n(14) If the retirant dies no later than 12 months after the effective date of his or her election under subsection (8), (10), or (11), the retirement allowance for the surviving spouse established under subsection (8), (10), or (11) must terminate 12 months after the death of the retirant.\n\n(15) Unless otherwise provided in an applicable collective bargaining agreement, or by order of the director of the department of state police, a retirement allowance must not be paid under this section if at the time the member submits his retirement application the member is on suspension without pay for conduct involving the breach of the public trust.\n\nHistory:1986, Act 182, Eff.

      "text": "(1) A deferred retirement option plan is established within the defined benefit plan that is part of the retirement system, and it is to be administered by the office of retirement services. Exclusively represented members of the retirement system may only participate in the deferred retirement option plan pursuant to notice from their collective bargaining agent that the agent agrees to the terms of the deferred retirement option plan. For each fiscal year that begins on or after October 1, 2004, the director of state police and the retirement board may elect to discontinue accepting applications for the deferred retirement option plan.\n\n(2) An officer who has 25 years or more of credited service under this act or former act 1935 PA 251, or both, may elect to participate in the deferred retirement option plan by executing the application provided by the office of retirement services. Once the application is accepted by the office of retirement services, the officer's participation in the deferred retirement option plan is irrevocable and he or she becomes a DROP participant. The officer is solely responsible for any federal, state, or local tax due as a result of his or her participation in the deferred retirement option plan.\n\n(3) Participation in the deferred retirement option plan does not guarantee continued employment. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an officer who elects to participate in the deferred retirement option plan will remain an active employee eligible to receive any applicable wage changes and benefits, will be subject to civil service rules and regulations, and will be subject to the policies and procedures of the department of state police and subject to removal by the governor, if applicable, in the same manner as if he or she had not elected to participate in the deferred retirement option plan.\n\n(4) An officer shall indicate on the application for the deferred retirement option plan the number of years that the officer wants to participate in the deferred retirement option plan, up to a maximum of 6 years. As a condition for participation, the officer agrees to retire at the conclusion of his or her participation in the deferred retirement option plan.\n\n(5) A deferred retirement option plan account shall be created in the accounting records of the retirement system for each DROP participant. Each deferred retirement option plan account shall earn interest at the rate of 3% per annum, prorated for any fraction of a year. The deferred retirement option plan account of a DROP participant shall be credited with the following percentage of his or her monthly retirement allowance as calculated pursuant to section 24 as if he or she had retired on the day prior to becoming a DROP participant:\n\n(a) 100% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 6 years.\n\n(b) 90% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 5 years but less than 6 years.\n\n(c) 80% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 4 years but less than 5 years.\n\n(d) 70% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 3 years but less than 4 years.\n\n(e) 60% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 2 years but less than 3 years.\n\n(f) 50% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 1 year but less than 2 years.\n\n(g) 30% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for less than 1 year.\n\n(6) A DROP participant shall not receive a monthly retirement allowance, as calculated pursuant to section 24, until termination of his or her deferred retirement option plan participation and commencement of retirement. A DROP participant shall not have any claim to any funds in his or her deferred retirement option plan account until he or she retires at the termination of his or her deferred retirement option plan participation.\n\n(7) Upon termination of the deferred retirement option plan participation and commencement of retirement, the former DROP participant shall select 1 or more of the following options with regard to his or her deferred retirement option plan account:\n\n(a) A total lump-sum distribution.\n\n(b) A partial lump-sum distribution.\n\n(c) A lump-sum direct rollover to another qualified plan if allowed by federal law and subject to the procedures of the retirement system.\n\n(d) Maintain the funds in the account.\n\nA former DROP participant shall remove all funds from his or her deferred retirement option plan account no later than April 1 following the later of the calendar year in which the DROP participant attains 70 years, 6 months of age or the calendar year in which the DROP participant is retired.\n\n(8) If a DROP participant or former DROP participant dies before removing all funds from his or her deferred retirement option plan account, the former DROP participant's designated beneficiary shall receive any remaining balances. If the former DROP participant has not named a beneficiary for his or her deferred retirement option plan account, the amount in the deferred retirement option plan account shall be paid to the beneficiary of the former DROP participant's retirement allowance. If the former DROP participant has not named a beneficiary to his or her retirement allowance, the balance in the former DROP participant's account shall be paid to the former DROP participant's estate.\n\n(9) If a DROP participant is found to be disabled under section 29, his or her participation in the deferred retirement option plan shall immediately cease and he or she shall be retired.\n\n(10) The deferred retirement option plan shall be administered in compliance with section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to a governmental deferred retirement option plan. If there is a conflict between this subsection and another subsection of this section, this subsection prevails.\n\n(11) A deferred retirement option plan shall not be implemented until the civil service commission adopts rules to regulate all of the following:\n\n(a) A DROP participant's payment for sick leave, annual leave, longevity, and related items.\n\n(b) A DROP participant's accrual of sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time, and related items.\n\n(c) A DROP participant's payment of group insurance plan premiums.\n\n(12) If the department receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that this section or any portion of this section will cause the retirement system to be disqualified for tax purposes under the internal revenue code, 26 USC 1 to 1789, then the portion that will cause the disqualification does not apply.\n\nHistory:Add. 2004, Act 83, Imd.

The retirement allowance must be equal to 60% of the member's final average compensation. On the death of the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse at the time of the death of the member, the retirement allowance must be paid to the children of the member under the age of 18 years, share and share alike.
