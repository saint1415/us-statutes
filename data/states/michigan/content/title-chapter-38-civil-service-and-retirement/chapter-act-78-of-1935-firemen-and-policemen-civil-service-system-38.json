If the nominee is certified by the commission as qualified, after a noncompetitive examination, he or she may be appointed temporarily to fill the vacancy until a selection and appointment can be made after a competitive examination, and in the manner prescribed in this act. However, the temporary appointment shall not continue for more than 3 months, nor shall successive temporary appointments be made to the same position.

No question in any form of application or in any examination shall be so framed as to elicit information concerning the political or religious opinions or affiliations of any applicant; nor shall inquiries be made concerning those opinions or affiliations; and all disclosures thereof shall be discouraged. Discrimination shall not be exercised, threatened, or promised by any person in the fire or police department against or in favor of an eligible applicant or employee in fire or police departments under this act because of his or her political or religious opinions or affiliations.\n\n(2) Vacancies in positions in the fire and police departments above the rank of fire fighter or police officer shall be competitive and shall be filled by promotions from among persons holding positions in the next lower rank in the departments who have completed 2 years in that rank and who have at least 5 years in the department. If there are more vacancies than there are persons with 5 years in the department, the commission may lower the requirements to 3 years in the department. If no person or persons have completed 2 years in the next lower rank, the commission may hold examinations among persons in such rank as to all intent and purposes as though 2 years of service had been completed by those persons. Promotions shall be based upon merit to be ascertained by tests to be provided by the civil service commission and upon the superior qualifications of the persons promoted as shown by his or her previous service and experience. In the event of only 1 person in the next lower rank, 1 or more persons in the second lower rank who have completed at least 5 years in the department may compete for the vacancy. Whenever a position becomes vacant for which examinations are held, the appointing power shall ask the commission for the name of the person eligible for appointment. The commission shall certify the name of the person highest on the eligible list at preceding examinations held under this act within a period of 2 years next preceding the date of the appointment for the class to which the vacant position has been allocated, who is willing to accept employment. If more than 1 vacancy is to be filled, an additional name shall be certified for each additional vacancy. The appointing power immediately shall appoint the person to the position. To enable the appointing power to exercise a choice in the filling of positions of promotion in the fire or police service, a promotion shall not be considered complete until after the expiration of a period of 6 months' probationary service, and if at the end of the probationary period the appointing authority finds that the conduct or capacity of the probationer has not been satisfactory, the appointing authority shall notify the probationer and the commission in writing. Otherwise, his or her retention in the higher position shall be equivalent to receiving full status and regular employment in the higher position. The probationer, upon receiving notice that his or her conduct or capacity has not been satisfactory in the higher position, may demand a written statement of particulars of reasons for that determination and may demand a hearing before the commission. The demands shall be in writing. In such a case, the probationer shall be entitled to a hearing before the commission and to a statement of particulars to be served not less than 7 days before the date of the hearing. The commission may affirm or reverse the decision of the appointing authority or may order an additional probation period not to exceed 6 months. The decision of the commission shall be final. If the probationer does not receive full status and regular employment in the higher position, he or she shall resume the duties of his or her former position, and the appointing power shall be entitled to another certification of eligibles in accordance with this act.\n\nHistory:1935, Act 78, Imd.

However, a member of any fire or police department encompassed by this act shall not be removed, discharged, reduced in rank or pay, suspended, or otherwise punished except for cause, and in no event until he or she has been furnished with a written statement of the charges and the reasons for the actions. In addition, all charges shall be void unless filed within 90 days after the date the violation occurred, except in the case of a probationer, whose violations may accumulate for the probationary period. In each case where charges have been made a copy of the statement of the reasons for the charges and the answers thereto, if the person sought to be removed desires to file a written answer, shall be furnished to the civil service commission and entered upon its records. The answer shall be filed by the member within 5 days after service of the charges upon him or her. If the person sought to be removed or reduced demands it, the civil service commission shall grant him or her a public hearing, which hearing shall be held within a period of 10 days after the filing of the charges in writing and a written answer thereto. Pending the period between the making of the charges as a basis for removal and the decision thereon by the commission, the member shall remain in office. At the hearing, the burden shall be upon the removing officer to justify his or her action. If the removing officer fails to make charges to the satisfaction of a member or members of a fire or police department in a city, village, or municipality, the member or members of the fire or police department may present the information to the civil service commission. If the civil service commission fails to justify the action of the removing officer, then the person sought to be removed shall be reinstated with full pay for the entire period during which time he or she may have been prevented from performing his or her usual employment, and no charges shall be officially recorded against his or her record. A written record of all testimony taken at the hearing shall be kept and preserved by the civil service commission, which record shall be sealed and not be made available for public inspection if an appeal is not taken from the action of the commission. If the civil service commission sustains the action of the removing officer, the person removed shall have an immediate right of appeal to the circuit court of the county in which the city, village, or municipality is situated. The appeal shall be taken within 90 days after the date the civil service commission enters its final order. If an appeal is made, the circuit court shall hear the appeal upon the original record, and additional proof shall not be offered into evidence. The circuit court's decision shall be final. However, the employee has the right to petition the supreme court for a review of the court's decision. The removing officer and the person sought to be removed at all times, both before the civil service commission and upon appeal, may employ counsel to represent either of them before the civil service commission and, upon appeal, before the circuit court.\n\n(2) If for reasons of economy it shall be deemed necessary by any city, village, or municipality to reduce the number of full-time paid members of any fire or police department, the municipality shall follow the following procedure: Removals shall be accomplished by suspending in numerical order, commencing with the last employee appointed to the fire or police department, all recent appointees to the fire or police department until the reductions are made. However, if the fire or police department increases in numbers to the strength existing before the reductions were made, the fire fighters or police officers suspended last under this act shall be reinstated before any new appointments to the fire or police department are made.\n\nHistory:1935, Act 78, Imd.
