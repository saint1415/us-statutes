Except as provided in this subsection and section 23c, a retirement allowance shall not exceed 64% of the salary stated in the application. Effective January 1, 1987, however, a member who first becomes a member on or before January 1, 1995 and who has 16 or more years of service shall also be entitled to a longevity allowance of 1.0% of the member's salary for each year of service beyond 16 years but, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not to exceed 20 years. Except as provided in this subsection and section 23c, the retirement allowance of a member entitled to a longevity allowance under this subsection shall not exceed 68% of the salary stated in the application. Beginning January 1, 1989, a member who first becomes a member on or before January 1, 1995, who has 20 or more years of service, and who meets the age and service requirements or service requirements to be eligible to receive a retirement allowance under this act shall be entitled to a longevity allowance of 1.0% of the member's salary for each year of service beyond 20 years.\n\n(6) A member who first becomes a member on or after January 2, 1995 and who becomes a retirant under this act is entitled to an annual retirement allowance equal to the product of the following:\n\n(a) The salary stated in his or her application.\n\n(b) Years and fraction of a year of service.\n\n(c) Three percent.\n\n(7) A retirant who elects to purchase military service credit pursuant to section 11(2) shall have his or her retirement allowance recalculated to include the military service credit purchased pursuant to that section. The first payment of the recalculated retirement allowance shall be made effective with the first check after the recalculation is made.\n\n(8) The retirement allowance of a retirant who, on January 1, 1987, satisfied the conditions required by section 9(3) shall have his or her retirement allowance recalculated to reflect the increase in salary for those years permitted by section 9(3) before the member became a retirant.\n\n(9) Within 30 days after becoming 55 years of age, a deferred vested member may elect to defer receipt of the retirement allowance to which the member is entitled under this act to a date certain, not to exceed 70-1/2 years of age. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, at the date the member designates to begin receipt of his or her retirement allowance, the member's retirement allowance shall be actuarially recomputed to reflect the member's age and life expectancy at initial receipt of the deferred retirement allowance. Upon request of the deferred vested member who elects to begin receiving his or her retirement allowance, the retirement board may pay to the member a lump sum payment of an amount equal to the sum of the retirement allowance that was deferred pursuant to this subsection. The retirement board shall not actuarially recompute the member's retirement allowance upon payment of a lump sum under this subsection. If a deferred vested member has elected to defer receipt of his or her retirement allowance under section 23(9)(a) and subsequently dies before retirement, 100% of his or her deferred benefit shall be paid in accordance with a beneficiary designation that the member shall have filed with the board.\n\n(10) Notwithstanding subsection (1), a member or deferred vested member may retire with a retirement allowance computed according to the applicable provisions of this section if all of the following apply:\n\n(a) The member or deferred vested member files a written application with the retirement board stating a date, not less than 30 nor more than 90 days after the execution and filing of the application, on which the member or deferred vested member desires to retire.\n\n(b) On the last day of the month immediately preceding the retirement allowance effective date stated in the application, the member's or deferred vested member's combined age and length of credited service is equal to or greater than 70 years and the member or deferred vested member is 50 years of age or older.\n\n(11) A member who retires before January 1, 1987 or a deferred vested member who leaves service before January 1, 1987 and becomes a retirant shall, in addition to the retirement allowance calculated under subsection (3) or (4), be entitled to a longevity allowance if the retirant or deferred vested member has more than 16 years of service. The longevity allowance is 1.0% of the former member's salary stated in the application for each year of service beyond 16 years but, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not to exceed 20. A member who retires before January 1, 1987 or a deferred vested member who leaves service before January 1, 1987 and becomes a retirant shall, in addition to the retirement allowance calculated under subsection (3) or (4), be entitled to a longevity allowance of 1.0% of the former member's salary stated in the application for each year of service beyond 20 years that was served after the member met the age and service requirements or service requirements to be eligible to receive a retirement allowance under this act. The retirement allowance of a retirant who satisfies the conditions under this subsection shall have his or her retirement allowance recalculated to reflect the longevity allowance for those years permitted by this subsection effective January 1, 1987 or the date of retirement, whichever is later. The application of the longevity allowance to the retirant's retirement allowance under this subsection shall be applied before the provisions of section 23c are applied to that retirement allowance. Except as provided in this subsection and section 23c, a retirement allowance shall not exceed 68% of the salary stated in the application.\n\nHistory:1957, Act 261, Eff.

The board of trustees shall administer the retirement system to fulfill this intent.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the retirement system shall be administered in compliance with section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to governmental plans and beginning January 1, 2010, applicable portions of the final regulations issued by the internal revenue service on April 5, 2007.

For purposes of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, the applicable limitation shall apply to aggregated benefits received from all qualified pension plans for which the office of retirement services coordinates administration of that limitation. If there is a conflict between this section and another section of this act, this section prevails.\n\n(3) The assets of the retirement system shall be held in trust and invested for the sole purpose of meeting the legitimate obligations of the retirement system and shall not be used for any other purpose. The assets shall not be used for or diverted to a purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members, vested former members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries before satisfaction of all retirement system liabilities.\n\n(4) The retirement system shall return post-tax member contributions made by a member and received by the retirement system to a member upon retirement, pursuant to internal revenue service regulations and approved internal revenue service exclusion ratio tables.\n\n(5) The required beginning date for retirement allowances and other distributions shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70-1/2 or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires.

This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.\n\n(8) For purposes of determining actuarial equivalent retirement allowances under this act, the actuarially assumed interest rate shall be 7% with utilization of the 1971 group annuity and mortality table.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the compensation of a member of the retirement system shall be taken into account for any year under the retirement system only to the extent that it does not exceed the compensation limit established in section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401(a)(17), as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue. This subsection applies to any person who first becomes a member of the retirement system on or after October 1, 1996.\n\n(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided under the retirement system in accordance with section 414(u) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 414(u).
