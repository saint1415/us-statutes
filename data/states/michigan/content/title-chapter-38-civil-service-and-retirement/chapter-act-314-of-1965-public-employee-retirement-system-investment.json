consideration for his or her own personal account from any party dealing with the system in connection with a transaction involving the assets of the system.\n\n(10) This section does not prohibit an investment fiduciary from doing any of the following:\n\n(a) Receiving any benefit to which he or she may be entitled as a participant or participant's beneficiary of the system.\n\n(b) Receiving any

The fiduciary shall continue the correspondence on a semiannual basis.\n\n(c) For each company newly identified in subdivision (a) with active business operations, not later than 60 days after the company is newly identified, the fiduciary shall send a written notice informing the company of its scrutinized company status and that it may become subject to divestment by the fiduciary. The notice shall offer the company the opportunity to clarify its Iran-related activities and shall encourage the company, within 90 days, to either cease its scrutinized business operations through substantial action or convert such operations to inactive business operations in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by the fiduciary.\n\n(d) If, within 90 days following the fiduciary's first engagement with a company pursuant to subdivision (c), that company announces a plan of substantial action, the company shall be removed from the scrutinized companies list and this section shall cease to apply to it unless it fails to implement its plan of substantial action within the designated time frame. If, within 90 days following the fiduciary's first engagement, the company converts its active business operations to inactive business operations, the company shall be subject to this section.\n\n(e) If, after 90 days following the fiduciary's first engagement with a company pursuant to subdivision (c), the company continues to have active business operations, and only while the company continues to have active business operations, the fiduciary shall sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities of the company, according to the following schedule:\n\n(i) At least 50% of the assets shall be removed from the fiduciary's assets under management within 9 months after the company's most recent appearance on the scrutinized companies list.\n\n(ii) 100% of the assets shall be removed from the fiduciary's assets under management within 15 months after the company's most recent appearance on the scrutinized companies list.\n\n(f) Except as provided in subdivisions (g) and (h), at no time shall the fiduciary acquire securities of companies on the scrutinized companies list that have active business operations.\n\n(g) No company which the United States government affirmatively declares to be excluded from its present or any future federal sanctions regime relating to Iran shall be subject to divestment or investment prohibition pursuant to subdivisions (e) and (f).\n\n(h) Subdivisions (e) and (f) shall not apply to indirect holdings in actively managed investment funds. For purposes of this section, actively managed investment funds include private equity funds and publicly traded funds. Before the fiduciary invests in a new private equity fund or publicly traded fund that is not in the fiduciary's portfolio as of July 17, 2008, the fiduciary shall perform due diligence to prevent investment in any private equity fund or publicly traded fund where the offering memorandum or prospectus identifies a purpose of the private equity fund or publicly traded fund as investing in scrutinized companies with active business operations in Iran. The fiduciary is not required to identify holdings in private equity funds or submit engagement letters to those funds. If the manager of a publicly traded, actively managed fund that is in the fiduciary's portfolio on July 17, 2008 creates a similar publicly traded, actively managed fund with indirect holdings devoid of identified scrutinized companies with scrutinized active business operations as defined in this section, the fiduciary shall replace all applicable investments with investments in the similar fund in an expedited time frame consistent with prudent investment standards.\n\n(6) The fiduciary shall file a publicly available report to the legislature that includes the scrutinized companies list within 30 days after the list is created. Annually thereafter, the fiduciary shall file a publicly available report to the legislature that includes all of the following:\n\n(a) A summary of correspondence with companies engaged by the fiduciary under this section.\n\n(b) All investments sold, redeemed, divested, or withdrawn in compliance with this section.\n\n(c) All prohibited investments under this section.\n\n(d) Any progress made under subsection (5)(h).\n\n(7) This section is no longer effective upon the occurrence of 1 or more of the following:\n\n(a) The Congress or President of the United States affirmatively and unambiguously states, through legislation, executive order, or written certification from the President to Congress, that the government of Iran has ceased to acquire weapons of mass destruction and support international terrorism.\n\n(b) The United States revokes all sanctions imposed against the government of Iran.\n\n(c) The Congress or President of the United States affirmatively and unambiguously states, through legislation, executive order, or written certification from the President to Congress, that mandatory divestment of the type provided for in this section interferes with the conduct of United States foreign policy.\n\n(8) With respect to actions taken in compliance with this section, including all good faith determinations regarding companies as required by this section, the fiduciary shall be exempt from any conflicting statutory or common law obligations, including any obligations in respect to choice of asset managers, investment funds, or investments for the fiduciary's securities portfolios.\n\n(9) The fiduciary, members of an investment advisory committee, and any person with decision-making authority with regard to investments of the fiduciary shall not be held liable for any action undertaken for the purpose of complying with or executing the mandates required under this section.\n\n(10) Scrutinized company does not include a company that the federal government has affirmatively excluded from federal sanctions for business the scrutinized company conducts relating to Iran, or that has consistently obtained applicable licenses or approvals to conduct transactions with Iran. If the fiduciary becomes aware at any time that a company that has not been affirmatively excluded from federal sanctions for business it conducts relating to Iran and has not received from the United States government applicable licenses or approvals to conduct transactions with Iran, that company is immediately subject to subsection (5).\n\n(11) If any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this legislation or its application to any person or circumstance is found to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable, or unconstitutional, the same is hereby declared to be severable and the balance of this legislation shall remain effective and functional notwithstanding such invalidity, illegality, unenforceability, or unconstitutionality.\n\nHistory:Add. 2008, Act 232, Imd.
