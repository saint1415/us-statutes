An irrevocable trust established under this subsection shall at all times be established and administered in accordance with section 115 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 115.\n\n(2) The governing board of each retirement system shall be the grantor and shall administer the irrevocable trust created for that retirement system in order to pay retirement health care benefits to its past members and their funding account dependents and reimburse medical expenses to its past members and their health reimbursement account dependents. The members of the retirement system board shall act as the trustees of the irrevocable trust for that retirement system. The trustees shall adopt a written trust agreement that meets all of the requirements set forth in section 9. The trustees of the irrevocable trust may establish and adopt policies and procedures for administering the irrevocable trust.\n\n(3) Each trust shall be managed and operated separately and independent of the other retirement system trusts.

This subsection does not apply to assets contributed or credited to a health reimbursement account.\n\n(5) Each trust shall receive state appropriations, employer contributions, mandatory contributions, voluntary contributions, investment earnings, refunds and reimbursements, and other permitted deposits, and shall make distributions for the payment of retirement health care benefits and reimbursement of medical expenses authorized by the trustees for the administration of such trust. However, an amount in excess of twice the annual current obligations of the trust shall not be deposited in or received by the trust unless the state treasurer certifies that the proposed deposit will not materially reduce the amount of federal funds received by this state to support payments made under the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b. The trustees are authorized to establish an administrative and investment fee structure to be charged against the funding account and the health reimbursement accounts within the trust to defray the costs of administering the trust.
