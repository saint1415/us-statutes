      "text": "(1) There is created the employees' savings fund, employer's accumulation fund, annuity reserve fund, pension reserve fund, income fund, expense fund, and health insurance reserve fund.\n\n(2) The employees' savings fund is the fund in which shall be accumulated at regular interest the contributions to the retirement system deducted from the compensation of members. The retirement board shall provide for the maintenance of an individual account for each member that shows the amount of the member's contributions together with interest on those contributions. The accumulated contributions of a member returned to the member upon his or her withdrawal from service, or paid to the member's estate or designated beneficiary in the event of the member's death, as provided in this act, shall be paid from the employees' savings fund. Any accumulated contributions not claimed by a member or the member's legal representative as provided in this act within 5 years after the member's separation from state service shall be transferred from the employees' savings fund to the income fund. The accumulated contributions of a member, upon the member's retirement, shall be transferred from the employees' savings fund to the pension reserve fund.\n\n(3) The employer's accumulation fund is the fund in which shall be accumulated the reserves derived from money provided by this state for the payment of all retirement allowances to be payable to retirants and beneficiaries as provided in this act. The amounts paid by this state shall be credited to the employer's accumulation fund. Upon the retirement of a member, or upon the member's death, if a beneficiary is entitled to a retirement allowance payable from funds of the retirement system, the difference between the reserve for the retirement allowance to be paid on account of the member's retirement or death and the member's accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in the employees' savings fund at the time of his or her retirement or death shall be transferred from the employer's accumulation fund to the pension reserve fund. If, in any year, the pension reserve fund is insufficient to cover the reserves for retirement allowances and other benefits being paid from the fund, the amount or amounts of the insufficiency or insufficiencies shall be transferred from the employer's accumulation fund to the pension reserve fund.\n\n(4) The annuity reserve fund is the fund from which shall be paid all annuities, or benefits in lieu of annuities, because of which reserves have been transferred from the employees' savings fund to the annuity reserve fund. Upon the adoption of this act, the balance in the annuity reserve fund shall be transferred to the pension reserve fund, and the annuities heretofore payable from the annuity reserve fund shall thereafter become payable from the pension reserve fund.\n\n(5) The pension reserve fund is the fund from which shall be paid all retirement allowances and benefits in lieu of pensions, as provided in this act. For a disability retirant returned to active service with this state, his or her pension reserve, computed as of the date of return, shall be transferred from the pension reserve fund to the employees' savings fund and the employer's accumulation fund in the proportion that this reserve, as of the date of his or her retirement, was transferred to the pension reserve fund from the employees' savings fund and from the employer's accumulation fund. The amounts transferred to the employees' savings fund under this section shall be credited to the member's individual account in the fund.\n\n(6) An income fund is created for the purpose of crediting regular interest on the amounts in the various other funds of the retirement system with the exception of the expense fund, and to provide a contingent fund out of which special requirements of any of the other funds may be covered. Transfers for special requirements shall be made only when the amount in the income fund exceeds the ordinary requirements of the fund as evidenced by a resolution of the retirement board recorded in its minutes. The retirement board shall annually allow regular interest for the preceding year to each of the funds enumerated in subsections (2), (3), (4), (5), and (8), and the amount allowed under this subsection shall be due and payable to each of these funds and shall be annually credited to the funds by the retirement board and paid from the income fund. However, interest on contributions from members within a calendar year shall begin on the first day of the next calendar year, and shall be credited at the end of the calendar year. Except as provided in this subsection, income, interest, and dividends derived from the deposits and investments authorized by this act shall be paid into the income fund. The retirement system shall determine the share of income, interest, and dividends attributable to the balance in the health advance funding subaccount created under subsection (9) and the share of income, interest, and dividends attributable to the health advance funding subaccount balance shall be paid into the health advance funding subaccount. The retirement board is authorized to accept gifts and bequests. Any funds that come into the possession of the retirement system as a gift or bequest, or any funds that may be transferred from the employees' savings fund by reason of lack of claimant, or because of a surplus in any fund created by this act, or any other money the disposition of which is not otherwise provided for in this act shall be credited to the income fund.\n\n(7) The expense fund is the fund from which shall be paid the expenses of the administration of this act, exclusive of amounts payable as retirement allowances and other benefits provided for in this act. The legislature shall appropriate the funds necessary to defray and cover the expenses of administering this act.\n\n(8) The health insurance reserve fund is the fund into which appropriations made by the legislature, subscriber co-payments, and payments by the retirement system under section 68 for health, dental, and vision insurance premiums are paid. Health, dental, and vision insurance premiums payable pursuant to sections 20d and 68 shall be paid from the health insurance reserve fund. The assets and any earnings on the assets contained in the health insurance reserve fund and the health advance funding subaccount described in subsection (9) are not to be treated as pension assets for any purpose.\n\n(9) The health advance funding subaccount is the account to which amounts transferred pursuant to sections 20d, 38(6), and 52 are credited. Any amounts received in the health advance funding subaccount and accumulated earnings on those amounts shall not be expended until the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 20d is at least 100% funded. The department may expend funds or transfer funds to another account to expend for health benefits under section 20d if the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 20d is at least 100% funded. For each fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 20d is at least 100% funded by the health advance funding subaccount, amounts received in the health advance funding subaccount and accumulated earnings on those amounts may be expended or credited to fund health benefits under section 20d as provided in section 38(3). For the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2003 only, the general fund portion of all amounts received in the health advance funding subaccount as of October 1, 2002 and accumulated earnings on those amounts shall be transferred to the general fund. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department may transfer amounts from the health advance funding subaccount to the employer's accumulation fund created under this section if the department does both of the following:\n\n(a) At least 45 days before the intended transfer, submits a request to the chairs of the senate and house appropriations committees and, at least 15 days before the intended transfer, obtains the approval of both the senate and house appropriations committees.\n\n(b) Ensures that the request submitted to the senate and house appropriations committees contains an actuarial valuation prepared pursuant to section 38 that demonstrates that as of the beginning of a fiscal year, and after all credits and transfers required by this act for the previous fiscal year have been made, the sum of the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions does not exceed the actuarial present value of benefits.\n\n(10) The description of the various funds in this section shall be interpreted to refer to the accounting records of the retirement system and not to the segregation of assets credited to the various funds of the retirement system.\n\nHistory:1943, Act 240, Eff.

The employees may use service previously performed as an employee of this state in meeting the service requirements for the retirement allowances and death benefits provided by the retirement system. However, the prior service must not be used in computing the amount of a retirement allowance to be paid by the retirement system unless the employee pays to the retirement system the amount the employee's contributions would have been had the employee become a member immediately on employment by the state with interest compounded annually at the regular rate from a date 1 year after the date of employment by this state to the date of payment. An individual who draws compensation as a state employee of a political subdivision of this state is eligible for the benefits provided by this act to the extent of the individual's compensation paid by this state. An individual who meets the requirements of section 44a is a member of the retirement system.\n\n(2) Elected or appointed state officials may elect not to become or continue as members of the retirement system by filing written notice with the retirement board.

Upon the retirant's death, his or her reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member nominated by written designation executed and filed with the retirement board before the effective date of his or her retirement.\n\n(b) Option B. Upon the retirant's death, 1/2 of his or her reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member nominated by written designation executed and filed with the retirement board before the effective date of his or her retirement.\n\n(c) Option C.

A retirement allowance beneficiary designated under this section shall not be changed on or after the effective date of the retirement allowance, and shall be either a spouse, brother, sister, parent, child, including an adopted child, or grandchild of the person making the designation. Payment to a retirement allowance beneficiary shall begin on the first day of the month following the death of the retirant or member.\n\n(3) If the retirement allowance beneficiary named under a payment option under subsection (1) predeceases the retirant, the retirant's benefit shall revert to the regular retirement allowance, effective with the first day of the month following the retirement allowance beneficiary's death. For a retirant whose effective date of retirement was on or before June 28, 1976, this subsection shall apply, but the regular retirement allowance is not payable for any month beginning before the later of the retirement allowance beneficiary's death or January 1, 1986. A retirant who on January 1, 1986 is receiving a reduced retirement allowance because the retirant designated a retirement allowance beneficiary and the retirement allowance beneficiary predeceased the retirant is eligible to receive the regular retirement allowance beginning January 1, 1986, but the regular retirement allowance is not payable for any month beginning before January 1, 1986.\n\n(4) A member who continues in the employ of this state on and after the date he or she acquires 10 years of service credit or becomes eligible for deferred retirement as provided by section 20(4) or (5), whichever occurs first, may by written declaration executed and filed with the retirement board elect option A, provided for in subsection (1)(a), and nominate a retirement allowance beneficiary in the same manner as if the member were then retiring from service, notwithstanding that the member may not have attained 60 years of age. If the beneficiary's death or divorce from the member occurs before the effective date of the member's retirement, the member's election of option A and nomination of retirement allowance beneficiary shall be automatically revoked and the member may again elect option A and nominate a retirement allowance beneficiary at any time before the effective date of retirement. If a member who has made an election and nominated a retirement allowance beneficiary as provided in this subsection dies before the effective date of his or her retirement, then the retirement allowance beneficiary shall immediately receive the retirement allowance that he or she would have been entitled to receive under option A if the member had been regularly retired on the date of the member's death. Except as otherwise provided by subsection (5), if a member who has made an election under this subsection subsequently retires under this act, his or her election of option A shall take effect at the time of retirement. Subject to the requirements of subsection (5), the member, before the effective date of retirement, but not after the effective date of retirement, may revoke his or her previous election of option A and elect to receive his or her retirement allowance as a regular retirement allowance or under option B or C as provided for in subsection (1). A retirement allowance shall not be paid under this subsection on account of the death of a member if any benefits are paid under section 27 on account of his or her death. If a deferred member who has an option A election in effect dies before the effective date of his or her retirement, the retirement allowance payable under option A shall be paid to the retirement allowance beneficiary at the time the deceased deferred member otherwise would have been eligible to begin receiving benefits.\n\n(5) If a member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the effective date of the retirement allowance, an election under this section, other than an election of a payment option under subsection (1) naming the spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary, shall not be effective unless the election is signed by the spouse. However, this requirement may be waived by the retirement board if the signature of a spouse cannot be obtained because of extenuating circumstances. As used in this subsection, \"spouse\" means the person to whom the member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the effective date of the retirement allowance.\n\n(6) Until July 1, 1991, upon request in a form as determined by the retirement board, a nonduty disability retirant who retired under section 24 may change his or her election to receive a disability retirement allowance computed as a regular retirement allowance and elect to receive the actuarial equivalent at the time of the election pursuant to this subsection of his or her disability retirement allowance in a reduced retirement allowance payable to the retirant and the retirant's spouse pursuant to the provisions of a payment option as provided in subsection (1), if the disability retirement allowance effective date was before November 12, 1985 and the retirant had 25 or more years of credited service on the disability retirement allowance effective date. The nonduty disability retirant shall begin to receive the reduced retirement allowance under this subsection effective the first day of the month following the month in which the retirant makes the election pursuant to this subsection. As used in this subsection, \"spouse\" means the person to whom the nonduty disability retirant was married on the effective date of his or her disability retirement allowance and on the date the retirant makes the election pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(7) If a member who continues in the employ of this state on and after the date he or she acquires 10 years of service credit, or on and after the date he or she becomes eligible for deferred retirement as provided by section 20(4) or (5), whichever occurs first, and who does not have an election of option A in force as provided in subsection (4), dies before the effective date of retirement and leaves a surviving spouse, the spouse shall receive a retirement allowance computed in the same manner as if the member had retired effective the day before the date of his or her death, elected option A, and nominated the spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary. When the retirement allowance beneficiary dies, his or her retirement allowance shall terminate. If the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments received by the beneficiary is less than the accumulated contributions credited to the member's account in the employees' savings fund at the time of the member's death, the difference between the accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments received by the beneficiary shall be transferred from the employer's accumulation fund or pension reserve fund to the employees' savings fund and paid pursuant to section 29. A retirement allowance shall not be paid under this subsection on account of the death of a member if benefits are paid under section 27 on account of his or her death. If the other requirements of this subsection are met but a surviving spouse does not exist, each of the deceased member's surviving children less than 18 years of age shall receive an allowance of an equal share of the retirement allowance that would have been paid to the spouse if living at the time of the deceased member's death. Payments under this subsection shall cease upon the surviving child's marriage, adoption, or becoming 18 years of age, which occurs first.\n\n(8) If a retirant receiving a reduced retirement allowance under a payment option under subsection (1) is divorced from the spouse who had been designated as the retirant's retirement allowance beneficiary under the option, the election of the payment option shall be considered void by the retirement system if the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act and dated after June 27, 1991 provides that the election of the payment option under subsection (1) is to be considered void by the retirement system and the retirant provides a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, to the retirement system. If the election of a payment option under subsection (1) is considered void by the retirement system under this subsection, the retirant's retirement allowance shall revert to a regular retirement allowance, including postretirement adjustments, if any, subject to an award or order of the court as described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act. The retirement allowance shall revert to a regular retirement allowance under this subsection effective the first of the month after the date the retirement system receives a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court. This subsection does not supersede a judgment of divorce or award or order of the court in effect on June 27, 1991. This subsection does not require the retirement system to distribute or pay retirement assets on behalf of a retirant in an amount that exceeds the actuarially determined amount that would otherwise become payable if a judgment of divorce had not been rendered.\n\nHistory:1943, Act 240, Eff.

An annual actuarial valuation shall be made of the retirement system in order to determine the actuarial condition of the retirement system and the required contribution to the retirement system. The actuary shall report to the legislature by April 15 of each year on the actuarial condition of the retirement system as of the end of the previous fiscal year and on the projections of state contributions for the next fiscal year. The actuary shall certify in the report that the techniques and methodologies used are generally accepted within the actuarial profession and that the assumptions and cost estimates used fall within the range of reasonable and prudent assumptions and cost estimates. An annual actuarial gain-loss experience study of the retirement system shall be made in order to determine the financial effect of variations of actual retirement system experience from projected experience.\n\n(2) The contribution rate for monthly benefits payable in the event of the death of a member before retirement or the disability of a member shall be computed using an individual projected benefit entry age normal cost method of valuation.\n\n(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the contribution rate for benefits shall be computed using an individual projected benefit entry age normal cost method of valuation. For the 1995-96 state fiscal year and for each subsequent fiscal year in which the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits is less than 100% funded, the contribution rate for benefits provided under section 20d shall be computed using a cash disbursement method with the payment schedule for the employer being based upon and applied to the combined payrolls of the employees who are members and qualified participants. Beginning in the fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 20d is at least 100% funded by the health advance funding subaccount created under section 11(9), and continuing for each subsequent fiscal year, the contribution rate for health benefits provided under section 20d shall be computed using an individual projected benefit entry age normal cost method of valuation. The contribution rate for service that may be rendered in the current year, the normal cost contribution rate, shall be equal to the aggregate amount of individual entry age normal costs divided by 1% of the aggregate amount of active members' valuation compensation. The unfunded actuarial accrued liability shall be equal to the actuarial present value of benefits reduced by the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions and the actuarial value of assets on the valuation date. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability shall be amortized in accordance with generally accepted governmental accounting standards over a period equal to or less than 40 years, with the payment schedule for the employer being based upon and applied to the combined payrolls of the employees who are members and qualified participants.\n\n(4) The legislature annually shall appropriate to the retirement system the amount determined pursuant to subsections (2) and (3). The state treasurer shall transfer monthly to the retirement system an amount equal to the product of the contribution rates determined in subsections (2) and (3) times the aggregate amount of active member or qualified participant compensation, as appropriate, paid during that month. Not later than 60 days after the termination of each state fiscal year, the executive secretary of the retirement board shall certify to the director of the department of technology, management, and budget the actual aggregate compensations paid to active members and qualified participants during the preceding state fiscal year.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), the difference, if any, shall be submitted in the executive budget to the legislature for appropriation in the next succeeding state fiscal year. This subsection does not apply for those fiscal years in which a deposit occurs pursuant to subsection (6).\n\n(5) For differences occurring in fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 1991, a minimum of 20% of the difference between the estimated and the actual aggregate compensation and the estimated and the actual contribution rate described in subsection (4), if any, may be submitted in the executive budget to the legislature for appropriation in the next succeeding state fiscal year and a minimum of 25% of the remaining difference shall be submitted in the executive budget to the legislature for appropriation in each of the following 4 state fiscal years, or until 100% of the remaining difference is submitted, whichever first occurs. In addition, interest shall be included for each year that a portion of the remaining difference is carried forward. The interest rate shall equal the actuarially assumed rate of investment return for the state fiscal year in which payment is made. This subsection does not apply for those fiscal years in which a deposit occurs pursuant to subsection (6).\n\n(6) For each fiscal year that begins on or after October 1, 2001, if the actuarial valuation prepared pursuant to this section for each fiscal year demonstrates that as of the beginning of a fiscal year, and after all credits and transfers required by this act for the previous fiscal year have been made, the sum of the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions exceeds the actuarial present value of benefits, the annual level percent of payroll contribution rate as determined pursuant to subsections (1), (2), and (3) may be deposited into the health advance funding subaccount created under section 11(9).\n\n(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if the retirement board establishes an arrangement and fund as described in section 6 of the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1686, the benefits that are required to be paid from that fund shall be paid from a portion of the employer contributions described in this section or other eligible funds.

      "text": "(1) This section is enacted under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, which imposes certain administrative requirements and benefit limitations for qualified governmental plans. This state intends that the retirement system be a qualified pension plan created in trust under section 401 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, and that the trust be an organization exempt from taxation under section 501 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501. The department shall administer the retirement system to fulfill this intent.\n\n(2) The retirement system shall be administered in compliance with section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to governmental plans and, beginning January 1, 2010, applicable provisions of the final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on April 5, 2007. Employer-financed benefits provided by the retirement system under this act must not exceed the applicable limitations set forth in section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue under section 415(d) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, to reflect cost-of-living increases, and the retirement system shall adjust the benefits, including benefits payable to retirants and retirement allowance beneficiaries, subject to the limitation each calendar year to conform with the adjusted limitation. For purposes of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, the applicable limitation applies to aggregated benefits received from all qualified pension plans for which the office of retirement services coordinates administration of that limitation. If there is a conflict between this section and another section of this act, this section prevails.\n\n(3) The assets of the retirement system must be held in trust and invested for the sole purpose of meeting the legitimate obligations of the retirement system and must not be used for any other purpose. The assets must not be used for or diverted to a purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members, vested former members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries before satisfaction of all retirement system liabilities.\n\n(4) The retirement system shall return post-tax member contributions made by a member and received by the retirement system to a member on retirement, under Internal Revenue Service regulations and approved Internal Revenue Service exclusion ratio tables.\n\n(5) The required beginning date for retirement allowances and other distributions must not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70-1/2 or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires. The required minimum distribution requirements imposed by section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, apply to this act and must be administered in accordance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the required minimum distribution requirements for all years to which the required minimum distribution requirements apply to the retirement system.\n\n(6) If the retirement system is terminated, the interest of the members, vested former members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries in the retirement system is nonforfeitable to the extent funded as described in section 411(d)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 411, and related Internal Revenue Service regulations applicable to governmental plans.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary that would limit a distributee's election under this act, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the retirement board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. This subsection applies to distributions made after December 31, 1992. Beginning October 1, 2010, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have any portion of an amount payable under this act that is an eligible rollover distribution treated as a direct rollover that will be paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 408, that is established for the purpose of receiving a distribution on behalf of the beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity under section 402(c)(11) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 402.\n\n(8) For purposes of determining actuarial equivalent retirement allowances under sections 31(1) and 20(2), the actuarially assumed interest rate must be determined by the director of the department of technology, management, and budget and the retirement board in consultation with the actuary using the mortality tables adopted by the department of technology, management, and budget and the retirement board.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, the compensation of a member of the retirement system must be taken into account for any year under the retirement system only to the extent that it does not exceed the compensation limit established in section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue. This subsection applies to an individual who first becomes a member of the retirement system after September 30, 1996.\n\n(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service must be provided under the retirement system in accordance with section 414(u) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 414. This subsection applies to all qualified military service after December 11, 1994. Beginning on January 1, 2007, in accordance with section 401(a)(37) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, if a member dies while performing qualified military service for purposes of determining death benefits payable under this act, the member is treated as having resumed and then terminated employment because of death.\n\nHistory:Add. 1995, Act 176, Imd.
