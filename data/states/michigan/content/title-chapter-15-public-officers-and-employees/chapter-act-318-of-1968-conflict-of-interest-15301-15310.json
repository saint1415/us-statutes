In the case of a corporation, the actual knowledge must be that of a person or body finally approving the contract for the corporation. All actions to avoid any contract hereunder shall be brought within 1 year after discovery of circumstances suggesting the existence of a violation of the constitutional provision as implemented by this act. In order to meet the ends of justice any such decree shall provide for the reimbursement of any person, firm, corporation or trust for the reasonable value of all moneys, goods, materials, labor or services furnished under the contract, to the extent that the state or political subdivision has benefited thereby.
