If the work is thereafter resold to a third party who is a bona fide purchaser before the consignor has been paid in full, the work of fine art ceases to be trust property and the proceeds of the resale are trust funds in the hands of the consignee for the benefit of the consignor to the extent necessary to pay any balance still due to the consignor.
