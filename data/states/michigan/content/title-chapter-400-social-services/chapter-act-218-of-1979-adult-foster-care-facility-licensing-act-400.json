This subsection applies for 5 years after the suspension, revocation, or nonrenewal of the former licensee's license or the denial of the convicted person's license.

The decision of the director or his or her designee shall be issued as soon as practicable after the hearing and forwarded to the protesting party by registered mail. The formal notice and hearing requirement in this subsection does not apply if the licensee and the department comply with section 22a.\n\n(5) A license shall not be denied, suspended, or revoked, a renewal shall not be refused, and a regular license shall not be modified to a provisional license unless the department gives the licensee or applicant written notice of the grounds of the proposed denial, revocation, refusal to renew, or modification. If the licensee or applicant appeals the denial, revocation, refusal to renew, or modification by filing a written appeal with the director within 30 days after receipt of the written notice, the director or the director's designated representative shall conduct a contested case hearing at which the licensee or applicant may present testimony and confront witnesses.

If required under this subdivision, the adult foster care facility shall provide on-site supervision of an individual in the facility on a conditional basis under this subsection by an individual who has undergone a criminal history check conducted in compliance with this section. An adult foster care facility may permit an individual in the facility on a conditional basis under this subsection to have regular direct access to or provide direct services to residents in the adult foster care facility without supervision if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(i) The adult foster care facility, at its own expense and before the individual has direct access to or provides direct services to residents of the facility, conducts a search of public records on that individual through the internet criminal history access tool maintained by the department of state police and the results of that search do not uncover any information that would indicate that the individual is not eligible to have regular direct access to or provide direct services to residents under this section.\n\n(ii) Before the individual has direct access to or provides direct services to residents of the adult foster care facility, the individual signs a statement in writing that he or she has resided in this state without interruption for at least the immediately preceding 12-month period.\n\n(iii) If applicable, the individual provides to the department of state police a set of fingerprints on or before the expiration of 10 business days following the date the individual was conditionally employed under this subsection.\n\n(7) The department shall develop and distribute the model form for the statements required under subsection (6)(b) and (c).

An adult foster care facility or staffing agency or an employee of the adult foster care facility or staffing agency shall not disclose criminal history record information obtained under this section to a person who is not directly involved in evaluating the individual's qualifications for employment or independent contract. An individual who knowingly uses or disseminates the criminal history record information obtained under subsection (3), (4), or (5) in violation of this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both. Except for a knowing or intentional release of false information, an adult foster care facility or staffing agency has no liability in connection with a criminal history check conducted in compliance with this section or the release of criminal history record information under this subsection.\n\n(11) Upon consent of an individual as required in subsection (3) and upon request from an adult foster care facility or staffing agency that has made a good-faith offer of employment or an independent contract to the individual, the relevant licensing or regulatory department shall review the criminal history record information, if any, and notify the requesting adult foster care facility or staffing agency of the information in the manner prescribed in subsection (4) or (5). Until the Federal Bureau of Investigation implements an automatic notification system similar to the system required of the state police under subsection (14) and federal regulations allow the federal criminal record to be used for subsequent authorized uses, as determined in an order issued by the department, an adult foster care facility or staffing agency may rely on the criminal history record information provided by the relevant licensing or regulatory department under this subsection and a request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make a subsequent determination of the existence of any national criminal history pertaining to the individual is not necessary if all of the following requirements are met:\n\n(a) The criminal history check was conducted during the immediately preceding 24-month period.\n\n(b) The individual has been continuously employed by an adult foster care facility, mental health facility, or covered health facility, or the staffing agency since the criminal history check was conducted in compliance with this section or meets the continuous employment requirement of this subdivision other than being on layoff status for less than 1 year from an adult foster care facility, mental health facility, or covered health facility.\n\n(c) The individual can provide evidence acceptable to the relevant licensing or regulatory department that he or she has been a resident of this state for the immediately preceding 12-month period.\n\n(12) As a condition of continued employment, each employee or independent contractor shall do both of the following:\n\n(a) Agree in writing to report to the adult foster care facility or staffing agency immediately upon being arraigned on 1 or more of the criminal offenses listed in subsection (1)(a) to (g), upon being convicted of 1 or more of the criminal offenses listed in subsection (1)(a) to (g), upon becoming the subject of an order or disposition described under subsection (1)(h), and upon becoming the subject of a substantiated finding described under subsection (1)(i). Reporting of an arraignment under this subdivision is not cause for termination or denial of employment.\n\n(b) If a set of fingerprints is not already on file with the department of state police, provide the department of state police with a set of fingerprints.\n\n(13) In addition to sanctions set forth in this act, a licensee, owner, administrator, or operator of an adult foster care facility or staffing agency who knowingly and willfully fails to conduct the criminal history checks as required under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 1 year or a fine of not more than $5,000.00, or both.\n\n(14) In collaboration with the department of state police, the department of technology, management, and budget shall establish and maintain an automated fingerprint identification system database that would allow the department of state police to store and maintain all fingerprints submitted under this section and would provide for an automatic notification at the time a subsequent criminal arrest fingerprint card submitted into the system matches a set of fingerprints previously submitted under this section. Upon notification, the department of state police shall immediately notify the department and the department shall immediately contact each respective adult foster care facility or staffing agency with which that individual is associated. Information in the database established under this subsection is confidential, is not subject to disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246, and shall not be disclosed to any person except for purposes of this act or for law enforcement purposes.\n\n(15) If an individual independently contracts with an adult foster care facility, subsections (1) and (2) do not apply if the individual is not under the adult foster care facility's control and the contractual work performed by the individual is not directly related to the clinical, health care, or personal services delivered by the adult foster care facility or if the individual's duties are not performed on an ongoing basis with direct access to residents.
