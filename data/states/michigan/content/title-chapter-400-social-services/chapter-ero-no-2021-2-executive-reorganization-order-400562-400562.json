      "text": "Michigan’s population is rapidly aging. Already, residents 50 and older make up 37 percent of the state’s population. By 2025 – 10 years ahead of the national projection – Michigan residents 65 and older will outnumber those younger than 18.\n\nActive aging is a life-long process and state government has an important role to play in ensuring that Michigan is a leader among states in healthy and active aging for all. Our Department of Health and Human Services plays a critical role ensuring that services to the aging are delivered holistically and effectively. However, these services are currently divided between multiple agencies within MDHHS, including the Medical Services Administration and the Aging and Adult Services Agency. Bringing these services together under the umbrella of the newly established Health and Aging Services Administration will strengthen the continuum of support and services by improving collaboration and efficiency among programs serving an aging population.\n\nGovernor Milliken recognized the importance of having an effective and visible advocate for aging and older persons in all government decisions when he signed the Older Michiganians Act, 1981 PA 180, creating the Commission on Services to the Aging. This order maintains the independence of the Commission, while elevating the voices of the aging community to the highest levels of the Department. Going forward, in addition to its responsibilities developing the state plan on aging, the Commission will advise the Director on how to best support an aging population in developing and implementing the Department’s strategic priorities.\n\nSection 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the governor.\n\nSection 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that the governor considers necessary for efficient administration.\n\nActing under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:\n\n1.
