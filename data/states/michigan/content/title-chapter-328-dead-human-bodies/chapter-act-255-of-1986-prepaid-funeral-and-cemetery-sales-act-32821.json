If the contract price is paid in installments, the commission retained by the contract seller or the provider shall not exceed the rate of the commission charged in the prepaid contract for each installment. On cancellation, a contract buyer is entitled to a refund as provided in section 13(1) or (2).\n\n(4) Only the following persons may serve as the escrow agent of funds under this section:\n\n(a) If the prepaid contract is a nonguaranteed price contract, the contract seller or provider of that nonguaranteed price contract.\n\n(b) If the prepaid contract is either a guaranteed or nonguaranteed price contract, a depository, a trust company, or a Michigan nonprofit corporation or association, in which the majority interest is held by 250 or more funeral establishments licensed under article 18 of the occupational code, 1980 PA 299, MCL 339.1801 to 339.1812, or a Michigan nonprofit corporation or association, in which the majority interest is held by 30 or more cemeteries registered and operated pursuant to the cemetery regulation act, 1968 PA 251, MCL 456.521 to 456.543.

The expenses and fees paid to the escrow agent shall not exceed 1% of the aggregate balance of principal and prior earned income from each account annually. If a fee is charged for reasonable expenses for the administration costs under an escrow agreement, the amount may be paid to the escrow agent periodically or may be accumulated in the account and paid at the time of death or upon cancellation of the contract. A cemetery that has elected the escrowing option for cemetery merchandise provided in subsection (2) may provide by written agreement with the escrow agent to be paid accumulated income generated solely by the investment of funds received for the cemetery merchandise. Such payments to a cemetery may not be made more frequently than once in a 12-month period and shall not exceed the net amount of income earned in the previous 12 months less any amounts paid to the escrow agent for expenses and fees described in this subsection and an amount equal to any increase in the Detroit consumer price index.\n\n(9) Amounts of principal and income held by an escrow agent other than the contract seller or provider of a nonguaranteed price contract may be commingled with principal and income derived from other prepaid accounts. However, a separate accounting of principal and income shall be maintained for each prepaid contract under the name of the contract beneficiary.\n\n(10) The escrow agent shall send to the contract buyer a notice stating the date, amount of the deposit, and the name of the escrow agent with whom the funds are deposited.\n\n(11) Upon the death of the contract beneficiary and upon performance by the provider of its obligation to furnish merchandise or funeral or cemetery services pursuant to the prepaid contract, funds held by the escrow agent shall be disbursed as follows:\n\n(a) If the prepaid contract is a nonguaranteed price contract, the principal and income shall first be disbursed by the escrow agent to the provider of the merchandise or funeral or cemetery services in payment of all reasonable charges. Thereafter, not less than 90% of the remaining balance of principal and income, if any, shall be disbursed to the person, other than the provider or the contract seller, designated in the prepaid contract or authorized by law to receive the surplus, and the remainder, if any, shall be disbursed to the provider as final compensation for its services. The amount paid to the person entitled to receive the surplus shall be as follows:\n\n(i) If no commission has been charged pursuant to this section, at least 90% of the remaining balance of principal and income in the escrow account.\n\n(ii) If a commission of 5% or less of the contract price has been charged, at least 95% of the remaining principal and income in the escrow account.\n\n(iii) If a commission of greater than 5% of the contract price has been charged, 100% of the remaining principal and income in the escrow account.\n\n(b) If the prepaid contract is a guaranteed price contract, the principal and income held by the escrow agent shall be disbursed to the provider, its designee, or its successor.\n\n(c) If the escrow agent is notified that there is a dispute as to whether the provider has performed all its obligations under the prepaid contract, the escrow agent shall file an action for interpleader or shall obtain an impartial arbitrator to determine the rights of the parties. Expenses of arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator.\n\n(12) A Michigan nonprofit corporation or association, in which the majority interest is held by 250 or more funeral establishments or by 30 or more cemeteries registered and operated under the cemetery regulation act, 1968 PA 251, MCL 456.521 to 456.543, may be designated as the escrow agent under this section only if the contract buyer has expressly authorized that designation in writing. If the contract buyer authorizes the appointment as escrow agent of a Michigan nonprofit corporation or association in the prepaid contract, the authorization shall be set forth in a separate paragraph which shall not be effective unless separately signed or initialed by a contract buyer and which shall state that the contract buyer may elect to require that a depository or a trust company be designated as the escrow agent.\n\n(13) If a prepaid contract is canceled, the escrow agent shall disburse the principal and income in accordance with section 13.\n\n(14) At least annually, unless waived in writing by a contract buyer, a contract buyer shall be furnished a statement indicating the current balance, the fees or expenses charged since the last statement, the amount of the refund to which a buyer is entitled if the contract is canceled, and the name and address of the escrow agent from whom additional information may be obtained about the account. The cost of the statement required by this subsection may be paid from the income and may be in addition to any other fee or charge authorized by this act.\n\nHistory:1986, Act 255, Eff.

The contract seller or provider shall promptly notify the escrow agent of the cancellation and of its effective date, if the escrow agent is other than the contract seller or the provider. After receipt of the notice of cancellation, except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), the escrow agent shall disburse not less than 90% of the principal and income in the escrow account to the contract buyer pursuant to this subsection and shall disburse the remainder of the principal and income, if any, to the contract seller or the provider.

Upon cancellation, the contract buyer shall receive a refund as determined pursuant to subsection (1).\n\n(4) After the death of the contract beneficiary, the contract buyer or the contract buyer's estate may cancel the prepaid contract only where there are no remains of the deceased; where the remains of the deceased cannot be recovered; or where a prepaid contract was not utilized due to lack of knowledge by the person or persons entitled to make funeral arrangements of the existence of the prepaid contract. After such a cancellation, the contract buyer or the contract buyer's estate shall receive a refund in accordance with subsection (1) or (2) within 30 days after receipt by the contract seller or the provider of a request for payment from the contract buyer or the contract buyer's estate. Contracts may be upgraded after the death of the contract beneficiary by a person on behalf of the contract beneficiary's estate or by a person entitled to make funeral or cemetery arrangements. This subsection does not prevent the transfer of a contract from 1 provider to another provider upon the request of those entitled to make funeral arrangements.\n\n(5) Prior to the death of the contract beneficiary and in the case of a prepaid contract or multiple prepaid contracts containing any of the merchandise or services escrowed under section 12(1) together with cemetery merchandise escrowed under section 12(2), the buyer may cancel that portion of the contract pertaining to the cemetery merchandise alone, without canceling the remaining portions. Such cancellation is subject to refund pursuant to section 13(2).\n\n(6) A contract seller or a provider that assigns or transfers its obligations under a prepaid contract to another provider shall notify the contract buyer of the assignment in writing. If the contract buyer cancels the contract within 30 days of the notification of the assignment, the buyer shall be entitled to a refund of 100% of the remaining principal and income plus the commission, if any, charged in accordance with section 12(1) or (2). An assignment or transfer of a provider's obligations under a prepaid contract that is made in connection with the sale of a business is subject to this subsection only if more than 50% of the ownership interest in the business is transferred to another person or persons within a 12-month period. Upon sale of the business, the notice requirement of this subsection is the responsibility of the purchaser. This subsection does not apply to an assignment of a financial interest in an installment contract to a financial institution. At the time that the contract seller or provider receives payment in exchange for selling or assigning its financial interest in an installment contract to a financial institution, the contract seller or provider shall be required to place in escrow the amount required by this act. This subsection does not apply to burial rights or other land interests, crypts, inscribed grave memorials, or niches, for which no refunds are available.\n\nHistory:1986, Act 255, Eff.

The family independence agency or department of community health shall advise the applicant for or recipient of assistance, or the patient or a legal guardian of a patient that additional merchandise or funeral or cemetery services subject to contract under this act will not be paid by the family independence agency or department of community health but shall not specify or require approval of particular merchandise or funeral or cemetery services selected by the applicant for or recipient of assistance, or patient or a legal guardian of a patient.\n\n(2) A prepaid contract approved by the family independence agency or department of community health shall not be revoked or canceled by the contract seller, contract provider, contract buyer, or their successors, or the estate of the contract beneficiary either before or after the death of the contract beneficiary. This subsection does not prevent those legally entitled to make arrangements for a contract beneficiary from reallocating the amount paid under the prepaid contract to different funeral or cemetery services and merchandise. A contract seller or provider shall assign an irrevocable prepaid contract to another provider upon the written request of the contract beneficiary, his or her successor, or those legally entitled to make arrangements for the contract beneficiary so long as the written request is received before a provider's obligations have been performed. An irrevocable contract shall not be considered in determining the eligibility of an applicant or recipient for assistance given under the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b. An irrevocable prepaid contract made under this section is not subject to the cancellation provision of section 13 or to the provisions of section 15(6).\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act, funds paid in connection with an irrevocable prepaid contract may, at the option of the provider, be held and deposited in the manner prescribed for a nonguaranteed price contract.\n\n(4) The family independence agency and department of community health may promulgate rules under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, to provide for the uniform administration of this section.\n\nHistory:1986, Act 255, Eff.
