      "text": "It is hereby found and declared that inadequate and insufficient facilities exist, both governmental and non-governmental, for research into the causes of physical and mental disease, for the training of students in medicine, psychiatry, dentistry, and nursing; that the lack of these facilities makes it difficult, if not impossible, to secure enough competent personnel for these professions; that the centralization of the resources of a number of institutions, governmental and non-governmental, into a medical center district would create better conditions for research and training; that in order to secure a centralization of facilities a medical center commission is necessary to interest the needed institutions in such an arrangement and to acquire the land needed for a medical center district; that in order to select the most favorable location it is necessary for cities and villages to exercise their power of eminent domain to acquire land for the use of both governmental and non-governmental medical institutions; that, since medical institutions find it difficult to finance the acquisition of land or the construction of buildings, a medical center commission is necessary as a centralized method of obtaining funds from whatever sources may be available; and the necessity in the public interest for provisions herein enacted is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination to be a public purpose and a public use.\n\nHistory:1949, Act 154, Eff.
