Local offices are encouraged but not required to translate vital documents into other languages for populations of less than the 3% or 500 thresholds described in this subparagraph, based on knowledge of the local community served.\n\n(d) Designating a language access liaison who will report to the officer or employee designated by the office of global Michigan as responsible for statewide language access coordination.\n\n(e) Any additional means necessary to achieve meaningful language access to public services.\n\nHistory:2023, Act 241, Eff.
