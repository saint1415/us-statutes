All such partnership associations shall elect their managers annually, and the entire number of managers shall be balloted for at 1 and the same time and not separately: Provided, That the by-laws of any such partnership association shall not be so amended as to reduce the number of managers of such partnership association, in case the votes of a sufficient number of shares are recorded against such proposed amendment, which, if cumulatively voted as herein provided, would elect 1 or more managers where the same number of shares, if cumulatively voted, would not be sufficient to elect the same number of managers of the reduced board of managers.\n\nHistory:1909, Act 45, Eff.
