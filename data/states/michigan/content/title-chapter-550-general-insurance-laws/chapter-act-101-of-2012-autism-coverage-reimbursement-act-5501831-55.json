The department shall develop and implement the use of an application form to be used by carriers and third party administrators who seek reimbursement for the coverage of autism spectrum disorders. The program standards, guidelines, templates, and any other forms used by the department to implement this program shall be published and available on the department's website.\n\n(3) Subject to the limitations provided under this section, the program shall, as approved by the department, reimburse carriers and third party administrators in an amount equal to the amount of paid claims that are paid 180 days after the effective date of this act by the carrier or third party administrator. A carrier or third party administrator shall apply, on the form prescribed by the department, for approval of funding associated with paid claims. As part of the application, the applicant shall include the results from a completed autism diagnostic observation schedule or the results from any other annual development evaluation and documentation verifying those paid claims for which they are seeking reimbursement under this program. In determining whether to approve an application for the reimbursement of paid claims under this section, the department may review whether the treatment for which the paid claims were paid is consistent with current protocols and cost-containment practices as described in section 416e of the nonprofit health care corporation reform act, 1980 PA 350, MCL 550.1416e, or section 3406s of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3406s.
