The assigned independent review organization must be approved under this act to conduct external reviews. The assigned independent review organization shall provide a written recommendation to the director on whether to uphold or reverse the adverse determination or the final adverse determination.\n\n(8) If a request is accepted for external review, does not appear to involve issues of medical necessity or clinical review criteria, and appears to only involve purely contractual provisions of a health benefit plan, such as covered benefits or accuracy of coding, the director may keep the request and conduct his or her own external review or may assign an independent review organization as provided in subsection (7) at the time the request is accepted for external review. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (18), if the director keeps a request, he or she shall review the request and issue a decision upholding or reversing the adverse determination or final adverse determination within the same time limits and subject to all other requirements of this act for requests assigned to an independent review organization.

Immediately upon making the decision to reverse its adverse determination or final adverse determination, the health carrier shall notify the covered person, if applicable the covered person's authorized representative, if applicable the assigned independent review organization, and the director in writing of its decision.
