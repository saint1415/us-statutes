The department may also require a licensee under this section to file a financial statement with the department showing all assets and liabilities and any other information the department may prescribe, to be filed within 30 days after the date requested. If there is a change of more than 50% of ownership or control or a change in the general partnership of a licensee, the department may require that licensee to file a new application for a license or an updated financial statement.\n\n(8) Each place of business of a retailer, and any place of business or other nonresidential building, office, or facility licensed under this section, must display the name and address of the retailer or licensee in a manner that is readily visible to the general public from outside the place of business, nonresidential building, office, or facility, as applicable.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, the following requirements apply to a secondary wholesaler, vending machine operator, or wholesaler, as applicable:\n\n(a) A secondary wholesaler may purchase or acquire a tobacco product for resale in this state only if that purchase or acquisition is directly from a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer that is licensed under this act and the tax imposed under this act has been paid on that tobacco product.\n\n(b) Except for a secondary wholesaler described in section 2(z)(ii), a secondary wholesaler shall maintain an established place of business in this state where a substantial portion of the business is the sale of tobacco products and related merchandise at wholesale and where, at all times, a substantial stock of tobacco products and related merchandise is available for sale to retailers for resale.\n\n(c) A wholesaler shall maintain an established place of business in this state where substantially all of the business is the sale of tobacco products and related merchandise at wholesale and where, at all times, a substantial stock of tobacco products and related merchandise is available for sale to retailers for resale.\n\n(d) A vending machine operator may purchase a tobacco product only from a secondary wholesaler, a wholesaler, or an unclassified acquirer that is licensed under this act.\n\nHistory:1993, Act 327, Eff.

      "text": "(1) A manufacturer, wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, vending machine operator, transportation company, unclassified acquirer, or retailer shall keep a complete and accurate record of each tobacco product manufactured, purchased, or otherwise acquired. Except for a manufacturer, the records must include a written statement containing the name and address of both the seller and the purchaser, the date of delivery, the quantity, the trade name or brand, and the price paid for each tobacco product purchased or otherwise acquired. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a licensee shall keep as part of the records a true copy of all purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading, and other written matter substantiating the purchase or acquisition of each tobacco product at the location where the tobacco product is stored or offered for sale. For an unclassified acquirer that does not maintain a place of business where tobacco products are sold, brought, or kept, the records required by this section must be kept at the physical address licensed under section 3. A retailer shall keep as part of the records a true copy of all purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading, and other written matter substantiating the purchase or acquisition of each tobacco product and related to any tobacco products subject to subsection (15), if applicable, at the location where the tobacco product is offered for sale for a period of 4 months from the date of purchase or acquisition. The department may, by giving prior written approval, authorize a person licensed under this act or a retailer to maintain records in a manner other than that required by this subsection. Other records shall be kept by these persons as the department reasonably prescribes.\n\n(2) A manufacturer, wholesaler, unclassified acquirer, and secondary wholesaler shall deliver with each sale or consignment of a tobacco product a written statement containing the name or trade name and address of both the seller and the purchaser, the date of delivery, the quantity, and the trade name or brand of the tobacco product, correctly itemizing the prices paid for each brand purchased, and shall retain a duplicate of each statement.\n\n(3) A vending machine operator shall keep a detailed record of each vending machine owned for the sale of tobacco products showing the location of the machine, the date of placing the machine on the location, the quantity of each tobacco product placed in the machine, the date when placed there, and the amount of the commission paid or earned on sales through the vending machine. When filling or refilling the vending machine, the operator shall deliver to the owner or tenant occupying the premises where the machine is located a written statement containing the operator's own name and address, the name and address of the owner or the tenant, the date when the machine was filled, and the quantity of each brand of tobacco product sold from the machine since the date when tobacco products were last placed in the machine. A person in possession of premises where a vending machine is located shall keep a record of each tobacco product sold through the vending machine located on the premises and the amount of commission paid by the person operating the vending machine. The records must consist of written statements required to be given by each person operating a vending machine for the sale of tobacco products as provided in this section.\n\n(4) A licensee under this act shall not issue or accept a written statement or invoice that is known to the licensee to contain a statement or omission that falsely indicates the name of the customer, the type, trade name, or brand of merchandise, the quantity of each type, trade name, or brand of merchandise, the prices, the discounts, the date of the transaction, or the terms of sale. A person shall not use a device or game of chance to aid, promote, or induce sales or purchases of a tobacco product, or give a tobacco product in connection with a device or game of chance.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), all statements and other records required by this section must be in a form prescribed by the department and must be preserved for a period of 4 years from the date of purchase or acquisition of the tobacco product and offered for inspection at any time upon oral or written demand by the department or its authorized agent by every wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, vending machine operator, unclassified acquirer, and retailer.\n\n(6) A licensee or retailer in possession or control of a tobacco product that has not preserved the statements and records required by this section because the licensee or retailer claims the tobacco product was purchased or acquired more than 4 years ago has the burden of proving that the tobacco product was purchased or acquired more than 4 years ago. A licensee or retailer that fails to preserve documentation sufficient to meet this burden of proof is in violation of the record-keeping requirements under this section for that tobacco product.\n\n(7) A shipping case or container of a tobacco product other than cigarettes received or acquired within this state by a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer from a manufacturer or any person located outside this state must bear either the name and address of the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer that made the first purchase of that shipping case or container or any other markings the department prescribes. The point at which a shipping case or container is considered to be received or acquired in this state is to be determined based on the facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, all of the following:\n\n(a) Ownership of the shipping case or container when it enters this state's borders or when it is delivered to the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer.\n\n(b) The risk of loss.\n\n(c) The use of a common carrier or a vehicle owned or leased by the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer to import or transport the shipping case or container into this state or deliver the shipping case or container to the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer.\n\n(8) A wholesaler or unclassified acquirer, licensed under this act, shall place or otherwise affix the markings prescribed by the department on every shipping case or container of a tobacco product other than cigarettes that is sold, transferred, shipped, or delivered by the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer to a retailer or another licensee, in this state.\n\n(9) If a marking prescribed by the department is to be affixed to a shipping case or container of tobacco products other than cigarettes by means of a mechanical or other device that applies the marking, the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer must obtain prior approval from the department to purchase, possess, or otherwise be permitted to use such a device. A wholesaler or unclassified acquirer whose license is revoked, is terminated, or has expired shall return all such devices in its possession to the department within 60 days of the revocation, termination, or expiration of its license. In addition to any other fine or any civil or criminal penalty or charge allowed by law, a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer that fails to return each device in its possession as required by this subsection is liable for a fine of $500.00 for each device not timely returned.\n\n(10) The markings required by this section on shipping cases and containers of tobacco products other than cigarettes must not be affixed in a manner that makes the markings illegible or that covers up, in whole or in part, or that otherwise obstructs or makes illegible the information or markings described in subsection (7).\n\n(11) If a tobacco product other than cigarettes is found in a place of business or otherwise in the possession of a wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, vending machine operator, unclassified acquirer, transporter, or retailer without the markings prescribed by the department or the information required by this section on the shipping case or container of the tobacco product, if required by this section, or if an individual package of cigarettes is found without a stamp affixed as provided under this act or if a tobacco product is found, or was acquired, imported, transferred, or sold, without proper substantiation by invoices or other records as required by this section, the presumption shall be that the tobacco product is kept in violation of this act and constitutes contraband subject to seizure and forfeiture under section 9. Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, if any tobacco product is adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been lawfully seized under this act, and if the adjudication of lawful seizure survives the exhaustion or lapse of any appeal rights, the tobacco product shall be automatically forfeited to this state and the person from whom that tobacco product was seized shall be liable for the tax imposed under this act on that tobacco product.\n\n(12) If a tobacco product is to be or is being transported on a public highway, road, or street in this state for shipment outside this state, as indicated by the bills of lading, invoices, packing slips, or other documentation related to that shipment, the licensee shipping the tobacco product shall cause to be placed on every shipping case or container in which the tobacco product is shipped the name and address of the consignee or purchaser to whom the shipment is made outside of the state and, for tobacco products other than cigarettes, the marking prescribed by the department unless the shipping case or other container already bears that marking from the licensee. A tobacco product that was located in this state is considered to have been shipped outside this state for purposes of this subsection if the tobacco product crosses the border of this state regardless of whether the tobacco product is delivered to or accepted by the consignee or purchaser to whom the shipment is made outside this state.\n\n(13) The department may require reports from a common carrier who transports a tobacco product to a point within this state from another person who, under contract, transports a tobacco product, or from a bonded warehouseperson or bailee who has in his or her possession a tobacco product. A carrier, bailee, warehouseperson, or other person shall permit the inspection of the tobacco products and examination by the department or its duly authorized agent of any records relating to the shipment of a tobacco product into, from, or within this state.\n\n(14) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (15), any person transporting, possessing, or acquiring for the purpose of transporting a tobacco product upon a public highway, road, or street of this state shall be licensed under this act as a transporter, unless that person is licensed under this act as an unclassified acquirer, wholesaler, transportation company, vending machine operator, or secondary wholesaler, and shall have in the person's actual possession invoices or bills of lading containing the name and address of both the seller and the purchaser, the actual or estimated date of delivery, the person's name and address, the quantity and trade name or brand of each tobacco product, the price paid for each trade name or brand in the person's possession or custody, and a copy of the license as prescribed under this act.\n\n(15) Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, a retailer in this state, or other person acting on behalf of a retailer in this state, is not required to be licensed under this act to transport a tobacco product upon a public highway, road, or street of this state for the purpose of delivering a tobacco product to a consumer in this state if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) The tobacco product was purchased by the consumer from the retailer at retail.\n\n(b) The consumer has paid for the tobacco product in full before the shipment and delivery of the tobacco product to the consumer.\n\n(c) The retailer or other person making the delivery has in its possession, at all times during which the tobacco product is being transported on a public highway, road, or street of this state, an invoice, receipt, or other documentation substantiating the sale to the consumer that states the name and address of the retailer, the name and address of the consumer, the delivery date, the trade name or brand of the tobacco product, the quantity, and the price paid for the tobacco product.\n\nHistory:1993, Act 327, Eff.

If approved by the department, a stamp may be placed in a location other than the bottom of each individual package of cigarettes.\n\n(3) Stamps must be firmly affixed in such a manner that the stamps cannot be removed without being mutilated or destroyed. A stamp must be affixed to each individual package in an aggregate denomination equal to the amount of the tax upon the contents of the individual package of cigarettes.

This inspection may also verify that all the stamps were produced under the authority of the department and that shipping cases and containers of tobacco products other than cigarettes bear any markings required by this act. Unless otherwise approved by the department, the regular business hours of a secondary wholesaler or vending machine operator are those hours disclosed on that secondary wholesaler's or vending machine operator's license application as required under section 3.

The department may require wholesalers, unclassified acquirers, secondary wholesalers, vending machine operators and retailers to discontinue offering for sale any unsold individual packages of cigarettes bearing a prior version of the stamp that the department has withdrawn from circulation. The department may set a reasonable timeline after which the prior version of the stamp may no longer be offered for sale and the new version of the stamp is required. A secondary wholesaler, retailer, or vending machine operator may return cigarette packages bearing discontinued stamps to a wholesaler for credit. A wholesaler or unclassified acquirer may take credit on its tax returns for individual packages of cigarettes bearing discontinued stamps that are returned to the manufacturer for credit less the appropriate discount paid.\n\n(10) Except as provided in subsection (11), a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer shall not give, sell, or lend any unaffixed stamps to another person and except as otherwise provided in this act, a person shall not accept, purchase, or borrow any unaffixed stamps from another person.\n\n(11) Upon written authorization of the department, a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer licensed under this act may appoint a stamping agent to affix stamps to individual packages of cigarettes.\n\n(12) Stamps may only be affixed to an individual package of cigarettes if the manufacturer of the cigarettes is identified on the lists of participating manufacturers or nonparticipating manufacturers maintained by the department pursuant to sections 6c and 6d.\n\n(13) The department of state police shall initiate inquiries to or otherwise access data from the department to support or in furtherance of its enforcement activities under this act.\n\nHistory:Add. 1997, Act 187, Imd.

The purpose of the equity assessment is to fund enforcement and administration of 1999 PA 244, MCL 445.2051 to 445.2052, and this act. The equity assessment is in addition to all other fees, assessments, and taxes levied by law. The equity assessment shall be collected by the department from each nonparticipating manufacturer selling cigarettes in this state. The equity assessment shall be collected and reconciled by April 15 of each year for cigarettes sold in the previous calendar year. The department shall credit a nonparticipating manufacturer with any prepayment made by the nonparticipating manufacturer pursuant to subsection (5) for that calendar year.\n\n(5) Except as provided in subsection (2), a nonparticipating manufacturer selling cigarettes in this state, whether directly or through a licensee or other distributor, retailer, or similar intermediary, shall prepay the equity assessment imposed in subsection (4) not later than March 1 for all cigarettes that are anticipated to be sold in the current calendar year. The prepayment amount shall be determined by multiplying 17.5 mills times the number of cigarettes that the department reasonably determines that the nonparticipating manufacturer will sell in this state in the current calendar year or $10,000.00, whichever is more. The department may require a nonparticipating manufacturer to provide any information reasonably necessary to determine the equity assessment prepayment amount. Not later than February 15 of each year, the department shall notify the nonparticipating manufacturer of the amount of the prepayment due for the current year.

The department shall certify the amount and the state treasurer shall pay that amount out of the proceeds of the tax.\n\n(10) A person liable for the tax may reimburse itself by adding to the price of the tobacco products an amount equal to the tax levied under this act.\n\n(11) A wholesaler, unclassified acquirer, or other person shall not sell or transfer any unaffixed stamps acquired by the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer from the department.

If the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer has unaffixed unsalable stamps, the department shall exchange with the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer new stamps in the same quantity as the unaffixed unsalable stamps. An application for refund of the tax must be filed on a form and in the manner prescribed by the department for that purpose, within 4 years from the date the stamps were originally acquired from the department. A wholesaler or unclassified acquirer shall make available for inspection by the department the unused or spoiled stamps and the stamps affixed to unsalable individual packages of cigarettes. The department may, at its own discretion, witness and certify the destruction of the unused or spoiled stamps and unsalable individual packages of cigarettes that are not returnable to the manufacturer.

      "text": "(1) A tobacco product held, owned, possessed, transported, or in control of a person in violation of this act, and a vending machine, vehicle, and other tangible personal property containing a tobacco product in violation of this act and any related books and records are contraband and may be seized and confiscated by the department as provided in this section.\n\n(2) If an authorized inspector of the department or a police officer has reasonable cause to believe and does believe that a tobacco product is being acquired, possessed, transported, kept, sold, or offered for sale in violation of this act for which the penalty is a felony, the inspector or police officer may investigate or search the vehicle of transportation in which the tobacco product is believed to be located. If a tobacco product is found in a vehicle searched under this subsection or in a place of business inspected under this act, the tobacco product, vending machine, vehicle, other than a vehicle owned or operated by a transportation company otherwise transporting tobacco products in compliance with this act, or other tangible personal property containing those tobacco products and any books and records in possession of the person in control or possession of the tobacco product may be seized by the inspector or police officer and are subject to forfeiture as contraband as provided in this section.\n\n(3) As soon as possible, but not more than 5 business days after seizure of any alleged contraband, the person making the seizure shall deliver personally or by registered mail to the last known address of the person from whom the seizure was made, if known, an inventory statement of the property seized. A copy of the inventory statement must also be filed with the state treasurer. The inventory statement must also contain a notice to the effect that unless demand for hearing as provided in this section is made within 10 business days, the designated property is forfeited to the state. If the person from whom the seizure was made is not known, the person making the seizure shall cause a copy of the inventory statement, together with the notice provided for in this subsection, to be published at least 3 times in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the seizure was made. Within 10 business days after the date of service of the inventory statement, or in the case of publication, within 10 business days after the date of last publication, the person from whom the property was seized or any person claiming an interest in the property may by registered mail, facsimile transmission, or personal service file with the state treasurer a demand for a hearing before the state treasurer or a person designated by the state treasurer for a determination as to whether the property was lawfully subject to seizure and forfeiture. The person shall verify a request for hearing filed by facsimile transmission by also providing a copy of the original request for hearing by registered mail or personal service. The person or persons are entitled to appear before the department, to be represented by counsel, and to present testimony and argument. Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the department shall hold the hearing within 15 business days. The hearing is not a contested case proceeding and is not subject to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. After the hearing, the department shall render its decision in writing within 10 business days of the hearing and, by order, shall either declare the seized property subject to seizure and forfeiture, or declare the property returnable in whole or in part to the person entitled to possession. If, within 10 business days after the date of service of the inventory statement, the person from whom the property was seized or any person claiming an interest in the property does not file with the state treasurer a demand for a hearing before the department, the property seized is considered forfeited to the state by operation of law and may be disposed of by the department as provided in this section. If, after a hearing before the state treasurer or person designated by the state treasurer, the department determines that the property is lawfully subject to seizure and forfeiture and the person from whom the property was seized or any persons claiming an interest in the property do not take an appeal to the circuit court of the county in which the seizure was made within the time prescribed in this section, the property seized shall be considered forfeited to the state by operation of law and may be disposed of by the department as provided in this section.\n\n(4) If a person is aggrieved by the decision of the department, that person may appeal to the circuit court of the county where the seizure was made to obtain a judicial determination of the lawfulness of the seizure and forfeiture. The action must be commenced within 20 days after notice of the department's determination is sent to the person or persons claiming an interest in the seized property. The court shall hear the action and determine the issues of fact and law involved in accordance with rules of practice and procedure as in other in rem proceedings. If a judicial determination of the lawfulness of the seizure and forfeiture cannot be made before deterioration of any of the property seized, the court shall order the destruction or sale of the property with public notice as determined by the court and require the proceeds to be deposited with the court until the lawfulness of the seizure and forfeiture is finally adjudicated.\n\n(5) The department shall destroy all cigarettes forfeited to this state. The department may sell all tobacco products, except cigarettes, and other property forfeited pursuant to this section at public sale. Public notice of the sale must be given at least 5 days before the day of sale. The department may pay an amount not to exceed 25% of the proceeds of the sale to the local governmental unit whose law enforcement agency performed the seizure. The balance of the proceeds derived from the sale by the department must be credited to the general fund of the state.\n\n(6) The seizure and destruction or sale of a tobacco product or other property under this section does not relieve a person from a fine, imprisonment, or other penalty for violation of this act.\n\n(7) A person who is not an employee or officer of this state or a political subdivision of this state who furnishes to the department or to any law enforcement agency original information concerning a violation of this act, which information results in the collection and recovery of any tax or penalty or leads to the forfeiture of any cigarettes, or other property, may be awarded and paid by the state treasurer, compensation of not more than 10% of the net amount received from the sale of any forfeited cigarettes or other property, but not to exceed $5,000.00 which must be paid out of the receipts from the sale of the property. If any amount is issued to the local governmental unit under subsection (5), the amount awarded under this subsection to a person who provides original information that results in a seizure of cigarettes or other property by a local law enforcement agency must be paid from that amount issued under subsection (5). If in the opinion of the attorney general and the director of the department of state police it is considered necessary to preserve the identity of the person furnishing the information, the attorney general and the director of the department of state police shall file with the state treasurer an affidavit setting forth that necessity and a warrant may be issued jointly to the attorney general and the director of the department of state police. Upon payment to the person furnishing that information, the attorney general and the director of the department of state police shall file with the state treasurer an affidavit that the money has been by them paid to the person entitled to the money under this section.\n\n(8) If a retailer possesses or sells cigarettes on which the tax imposed under this act has not been paid or accrued to a wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, or unclassified acquirer licensed under this act, the retailer shall be prohibited from purchasing, possessing, or selling any cigarettes or other tobacco products as follows:\n\n(a) For a first violation, for a period of not more than 6 months.\n\n(b) For a second violation within a period of 5 years, for a period of at least 6 months and not more than 36 months.\n\n(c) For a third or subsequent violation within a period of 5 years, for a period of at least 1 year and not more than 5 years.\n\n(9) The prohibition described in subsection (8) is effective upon service by certified mail or personal service on the retailer of notice issued by the department ordering the retailer to cease all sales and purchases of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Upon receipt of this notice, the retailer may return any tobacco products in the possession of the retailer upon which the tax imposed by this act has been paid or accrued to a wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, or unclassified acquirer licensed under this act. The department shall notify all licensed wholesalers, manufacturers, secondary wholesalers, vending machine operators, and unclassified acquirers of any retailer who has been prohibited from purchasing cigarettes or other tobacco products and the duration of the prohibition. A wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, or unclassified acquirer shall not sell cigarettes or other tobacco products to a retailer after receipt of notice from the department that the retailer is prohibited from purchasing tobacco products. Any cigarettes or other tobacco products found on the premises of the retailer during the period of prohibition are considered contraband and subject to seizure under this section, and constitute an additional improper possession under this subsection. The retailer may contest the order prohibiting purchase, possession, or sale of tobacco products in accordance with the appeal procedures and time limits provided in subsection (3) of this section. After completion of the appeals provided or upon expiration of the period to request such appeal, the department shall issue a final order and make service upon the retailer of an order to cease all purchases, possession, and sale of all cigarettes and other tobacco products for a specified period as appropriate. This order does not relieve the retailer from seizure and sale of a tobacco product or other property under this section, or relieve the retailer from a fine, imprisonment, or other penalty for violation of this act.\n\nHistory:1993, Act 327, Eff.
