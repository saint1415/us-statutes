The Tax Tribunal shall exercise its prescribed statutory power, duties, and functions of rule making, licensing, and registration, including the prescription of rules, rates, regulations, standards, and adjudications, independently of the Director of the Department of Commerce.\n\n(3) All records, personnel, property, and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds used, held, employed, available, or to be made available to the Tax Tribunal for the activities transferred to the Department of Commerce by this Executive Order are hereby transferred to the Department of Commerce.\n\n(4) The Chairperson of the Tax Tribunal, designated by the Governor, shall make internal organizational changes as may be administratively necessary to complete the realignment of responsibilities prescribed by this Executive Order.\n\n(5) The Director of the Department of Commerce and the State Treasurer shall immediately initiate coordination to facilitate the transfer and develop a memorandum of record identifying any pending settlements, issues of compliance with applicable federal and State laws and regulations, or other obligations to be resolved by the Tax Tribunal.\n\n(6) All rules, orders, contracts, and agreements relating to the assigned functions lawfully adopted prior to the effective date of this Executive Order shall continue to be effective until revised, amended, or repealed.\n\n(7) Any suit, action, or other proceeding lawfully commenced by, against, or before any entity affected by this Executive Order shall not abate by reason of the taking effect of this Executive Order. Any suit, action, or other proceeding may be maintained by, against, or before the appropriate successor of any entity affected by this Executive Order.\n\nIn fulfillment of the requirement of Article V, Section 2, of the Constitution of the State of Michigan of 1963, the provisions of this Executive Order shall become effective 60 days after the filing of this Executive Order.\n\nHistory:1991, E.R.O.
