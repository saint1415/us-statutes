      "text": "(1) The use or consumption of mobile wireless services is subject to the tax levied under this act in the same manner as tangible personal property regardless of where the mobile wireless services originate, terminate, or pass through, subject to all of the following:\n\n(a) Mobile wireless services provided to a customer, the charges for which are billed by or for the customer's home service provider, are considered to be provided by the customer's home service provider if the customer's place of primary use for the mobile wireless services is in this state. If the customer's place of primary use for mobile wireless services is outside of this state, the mobile wireless services are not subject to the tax levied under this act.\n\n(b) A home service provider is responsible for obtaining and maintaining a record of the customer's place of primary use. Subject to subsection (2), in obtaining and maintaining a record of the customer's place of primary use, a home service provider may do all of the following:\n\n(i) Rely in good faith on information provided by a customer as to the customer's place of primary use.\n\n(ii) Treat the address used for a customer under a service contract or agreement in effect on August 1, 2002 as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of the service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of the service contract or agreement.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding section 9 and subject to subsection (5), if the department chooses to create or provide a database that complies with the provisions of 4 USC 119, a home service provider shall use that database to determine the assignment of the customer's place of primary use to this state. If a database is not provided by the department, a home service provider may use an enhanced zip code to determine the assignment of the customer's place of primary use to this state. A home service provider that uses a database provided by the department is not liable for any tax that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an error or omission in that database. A home service provider that uses an enhanced zip code is not liable for any tax that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to another state if the home provider exercised due diligence to ensure that the appropriate street addresses are assigned to this state.\n\n(d) If a customer believes that the amount of the tax levied under this act or that the home service provider's record of the customer's place of primary use is incorrect, the customer shall notify the home service provider in writing and provide all of the following information:\n\n(i) The street address of the customer's place of primary use.\n\n(ii) The account name and number for which the customer requests the correction.\n\n(iii) A description of the error asserted by the customer.\n\n(iv) Any other information that the home service provider reasonably requires to process the request.\n\n(e) Not later than 60 days after the home service provider receives a request under subdivision (d) or subsection (5)(b), the home service provider shall review its record of the customer's place of primary use and the customer's enhanced zip code to determine the correct amount of the tax levied under this act. If the home service provider determines that the tax levied under this act or its record of the customer's place of primary use is incorrect, the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit any tax erroneously collected from the customer. A refund under this subdivision shall not exceed a period of 4 years. If the home service provider determines that the tax levied under this act and the customer's place of primary use are correct, the home service provider shall provide a written explanation of that determination to the customer. The procedures prescribed in this subdivision and in subdivision (d) are the first course of remedy available to a customer requesting a correction of the provider's record of place of primary use or a refund of taxes erroneously collected by the home service provider.\n\n(2) If the department makes a final determination that the home service provider's record of a customer's place of primary use is incorrect, the home service provider shall change its records to reflect that final determination. The corrected record of a customer's place of primary use shall be used to calculate the tax levied under this act prospectively, from the date of the department's final determination. The department shall not make a final determination under this subsection before the department has notified the customer that the department has found that the home service provider's record of the customer's place of primary use is incorrect and the customer has been afforded an opportunity to appeal that finding. An appeal to the department shall be conducted according to the provision of section 22 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.22.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding section 8 and subject to section 5, if the department makes a final determination under subsection (2) that a customer's place of primary use is incorrect, a home service provider is not liable for any taxes that would have been levied under this act if the customer's place of primary use had been correct.\n\n(4) If charges for mobile wireless services and other billed services not subject to the tax levied under this act are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges for mobile wireless services that are subject to the tax levied under this act, the nontaxable mobile wireless services and other billed services are subject to the tax levied under this act unless the home service provider can reasonably identify billings for services not subject to the tax levied under this act from its books and records kept in the regular course of business.\n\n(5) If charges for mobile wireless services and other billed services not subject to the tax levied under this act are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges for mobile wireless services that are subject to the tax levied under this act, a customer may not rely upon the exempt status for those mobile wireless services and other billed services unless 1 or more of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n(a) The customer's home service provider separately states the charges for mobile wireless services that are exempt and other exempt billed services from taxable mobile wireless services.\n\n(b) The home service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required by the home service provider, to identify the exempt mobile wireless services and other exempt billed services by reference to the home service provider's books and records kept in the regular course of business.\n\n(6) This section is repealed as of the date of entry of a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that substantially limits or impairs the essential elements of sections 116 to 126 of title 4 of the United States Code, 4 USC 116 to 126, and that final judgment is no longer subject to appeal.\n\n(7) For an air-ground radiotelephone service, the tax under this act is imposed at the location of the origination of the air-ground radiotelephone service in this state as identified by the home service provider or information received by the home service provider from its servicing carrier.\n\n(8) All of the following apply in the case of a bundled transaction that includes telecommunications service, ancillary service, internet access, or audio or video programming:\n\n(a) If the purchase price is attributable to products that are taxable and products that are nontaxable, the portion of the purchase price attributable to the nontaxable products may be subject to tax unless the provider can identify by reasonable and verifiable standards that portion from its books and records kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including, but not limited to, nontax purposes.\n\n(b) If the purchase price is attributable to products that are subject to tax at different tax rates, the total purchase price may be treated as attributable to the products subject to tax at the highest tax rate unless the provider can identify by reasonable and verifiable standards the portion of the purchase price attributable to the products subject to tax at the lower rate from its books and records kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including, but not limited to, nontax purposes.\n\n(c) The provisions of this subsection shall apply unless otherwise provided by federal law.\n\n(9) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Air-ground radiotelephone service\" means that term as defined in 47 CFR part 22.\n\n(b) \"Commercial mobile radio service\" means that term as defined in 47 CFR 20.3.\n\n(c) \"Charge\", \"charges\", or \"charge for mobile wireless services\" means any charge for, or associated with, the provision of commercial mobile radio service, or any charge for, or associated with, a service provided as an adjunct to a commercial mobile radio service, that is billed to a customer by or for the customer's home service provider regardless of whether individual transmissions originate or terminate within the licensed service area of the home service provider.\n\n(d) \"Customer\" means 1 of the following, but does not include a reseller or a serving carrier:\n\n(i) The person who contracts with the home service provider for mobile wireless services.\n\n(ii) If the end user of mobile wireless services is not the contracting party, then the end user of the mobile wireless service.

      "text": "(1) In computing the amount of tax levied under this act for any month, a seller may deduct the amount of bad debts from his or her gross sales, rentals, or services used for the computation of the tax. The amount of gross sales, rentals, or services deducted must be charged off as uncollectible on the books and records of the seller at the time the debt becomes worthless and deducted on the return for the period during which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and must be eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this section, a claimant who is not required to file a federal income tax return may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which the bad debt becomes worthless and is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax return. If a consumer or other person pays all or part of a bad debt with respect to which a seller claimed a deduction under this section, the seller is liable for the amount of taxes deducted in connection with that portion of the debt for which payment is received and shall remit these taxes in his or her next payment to the department. Any payments made on a bad debt shall be applied proportionally first to the taxable price of the property and the tax on the property and second to any interest, service, or other charge.\n\n(2) Any claim for a bad debt deduction under this section shall be supported by that evidence required by the department. The department shall review any change in the rate of taxation applicable to any taxable sales, rentals, or services by a seller claiming a deduction pursuant to this section and shall ensure that the deduction on any bad debt does not result in the seller claiming the deduction recovering any more or less than the taxes imposed on the sale, rental, or service that constitutes the bad debt.\n\n(3) After September 30, 2009, if a taxpayer who reported the tax and a lender execute and maintain a written election designating which party may claim the deduction, a claimant is entitled to a deduction or refund of the tax related to a sale at retail that was previously reported and paid if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) No deduction or refund was previously claimed or allowed on any portion of the account receivable.\n\n(b) The account receivable has been found worthless and written off by the taxpayer that made the sale or the lender on or after September 30, 2009.\n\n(4) If a certified service provider assumed filing responsibility under the streamlined sales and use tax administration act, 2004 PA 174, MCL 205.801 to 205.833, the certified service provider may claim, on behalf of the seller, any bad debt allowable to the seller and shall credit or refund that amount of bad debt allowed or refunded to the seller.\n\n(5) If the books and records of a seller under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement under the streamlined sales and use tax administration act, 2004 PA 174, MCL 205.801 to 205.833, that claims a bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts among member states of that agreement, the seller may allocate the bad debts.\n\n(6) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Bad debt\" means any portion of a debt resulting from a seller's collection of the use tax under this act on the purchase of tangible personal property or services that is not otherwise deductible or excludable and that is eligible to be claimed, or could be eligible to be claimed if the seller kept accounts on an accrual basis, as a deduction pursuant to section 166 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 166. A bad debt does not include any of the following:\n\n(i) Interest, finance charge, or use tax on the purchase price.\n\n(ii) Uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is paid.\n\n(iii) Expenses incurred in attempting to collect any account receivable or any portion of the debt recovered.\n\n(iv) Any accounts receivable that have been sold to and remain in the possession of a third party for collection.\n\n(v) Repossessed property.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), \"lender\" includes any of the following:\n\n(i) Any person who holds or has held an account receivable which that person purchased directly from a taxpayer who reported the tax.\n\n(ii) Any person who holds or has held an account receivable pursuant to that person's contract directly with the taxpayer who reported the tax.\n\n(iii) The issuer of the private label credit card.\n\n(c) \"Lender\" does not include the issuer of a credit card or instrument that can be used to make purchases from a person other than the vendor whose name or logo appears on the card or instrument or that vendor's affiliates.\n\n(d) \"Private label credit card\" means any charge card, credit card, or other instrument serving a similar purpose that carries, refers to, or is branded with the name or logo of a vendor and that can only be used for purchases from the vendor.\n\n(e) \"Seller\" means a person who has remitted use tax directly to the department on the specific sales, rental, or service transaction for which the bad debt is recognized for federal income tax purposes or, after September 30, 2009, a lender holding the account receivable for which the bad debt is recognized, or would be recognized if the claimant were a corporation, for federal income tax purposes.\n\nHistory:Add. 1999, Act 117, Imd.

However, this amendatory act is not intended to affect a refund required by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction for which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or have expired if the refund is payable without interest and after September 30, 2009 and before November 1, 2009.\"",

These records must be retained for a period of 4 years after the tax imposed under this act to which the records apply is due or as otherwise provided by law.\n\n(2) If the department considers it necessary, the department may require a person, by notice served upon that person, to make a return, render under oath certain statements, or keep certain records the department considers sufficient to show whether or not that person is liable for the tax under this act.\n\n(3) A person knowingly making a sale of tangible personal property for the purpose of resale at retail to another person not licensed under this act is liable for the tax imposed under this act unless the transaction is exempt under the provisions of section 4i.\n\n(4) If a taxpayer fails to file a return or to maintain or preserve sufficient records as prescribed in this section, or the department has reason to believe that any records maintained or returns filed are inaccurate or incomplete and that additional taxes are due, the department may assess the amount of the tax due from the taxpayer based on an indirect audit procedure or any other information that is available or that may become available to the department. That assessment is considered prima facie correct for the purpose of this act and the burden of proof of refuting the assessment is upon the taxpayer. An indirect audit of a taxpayer under this subsection must be conducted in accordance with 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and the standards published by the department under section 21 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.21, and must include all of the following elements:\n\n(a) A review of the taxpayer's books and records.

That assessment is considered prima facie correct for the purpose of this act and the burden of proof of refuting the assessment is upon the taxpayer. An indirect audit of a taxpayer under this subsection must be conducted in accordance with 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and the standards published by the department under section 21 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.21, and must include all of the following elements:\n\n(a) A review of the taxpayer's books and records.
