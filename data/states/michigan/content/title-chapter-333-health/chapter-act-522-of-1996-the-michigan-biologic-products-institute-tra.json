      "text": "The legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n\n(a) That increasing regulatory costs, the need to replace manufacturing facilities, the need to develop and the cost of developing new biologic products, the changing pediatric vaccine market, and the need to serve other markets outside the borders of this state have adversely affected the ability of the state to sustain a viable, self-supporting operation for the manufacture and distribution of vaccines and blood derivative products.\n\n(b) That allowing the Michigan biologic products institute to be conveyed to a private enterprise would assist the institute to become self-sustaining, avoid the need for future state general fund subsidies, retain the employment of many employees of the institute, and assure the state's access to biologic products to protect Michigan's citizens from infectious disease.\n\n(c) That the conveyance of the assets associated with the institute will not impair the public health mission of the department of community health and, if the institute is not conveyed to a private enterprise, the operations of the institute could be discontinued. If the operations of the institute are discontinued, the legislature recognizes the need for the disposal of the facilities and the expense to the state of costs related to employee separation from the institute and of costs related to disposal of the assets associated with the institute, both of which the legislature desires to offset by authorizing the conveyance of the assets associated with the institute to a private enterprise.\n\nHistory:1996, Act 522, Imd.
