Nor shall the state penalize, prosecute, or otherwise take adverse action against someone for aiding or assisting a pregnant individual in exercising their right to reproductive freedom with their voluntary consent.\n\n(2) In determining whether an abortion is medically indicated to protect the life or physical or mental health of a pregnant individual under subsection (1)(c), the attending health care professional may consider any factor that the attending health care professional considers relevant to the well-being of the pregnant individual, including, but not limited to, the pregnant individual's age and physical, emotional, psychological, and familial considerations.\n\nHistory:2023, Act 286, Eff.
