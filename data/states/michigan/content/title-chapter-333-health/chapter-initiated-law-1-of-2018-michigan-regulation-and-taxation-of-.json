In an action alleging a violation of subsection (1) involving a minor, proof that the licensee demanded and was shown a government-issued photographic identification appearing to be genuine and showing the minor to be 21 years of age or older, is a complete defense to the action.\n\n(7) It is presumed that a licensee, other than the licensee that last sold or transferred marihuana to a minor or visibly intoxicated person, is not a proximate cause of an injury that gave rise to a cause of action under subsection (2). This presumption may be overcome by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n(8) A minor or alleged visibly intoxicated individual does not have a cause of action under this section. A person does not have a cause of action against a licensee for any loss or damage sustained resulting from the injury or death of the minor or visibly intoxicated person.\n\n(9) An individual who suffers damage or who is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person as a result of a violation of subsection (1) has the right to recover actual damages in a sum of not less than $50.00 in each case in which the court or jury determines that intoxication was a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death.\n\n(10) A licensee authorized to sell or otherwise transfer marihuana under this act or a rule promulgated under this act must maintain insurance coverage provided by a licensed and admitted insurance company in Michigan in a minimum amount of $50,000.00 for actions brought under subsection (2).\n\n(11) This section provides the exclusive remedy for money damages against a licensee and the licensee's clerks, agents, and employees arising out of a violation of subsection (1). This subsection does not apply to a remedy available under law to lawful users of marihuana for liability resulting from the manufacture, distribution, transportation, or sale of adulterated marihuana.\n\n(12) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a civil action against a licensee is subject to the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.101 to 600.9947.\n\n(13) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Adulterated marihuana\" means a product sold as marihuana that contains any unintended substance or chemical or biological matter other than marihuana that causes adverse reaction after ingestion or consumption.\n\n(b) \"Minor\" means an individual who is younger than 21 years of age.\n\n(c) \"Visibly intoxicated\" means displaying obvious, objective, and visible evidence of intoxication that would be apparent to an ordinary observer.\n\n(d) \"Written notice\" means a communication in writing that does all of the following:\n\n(i) Identifies the minor or alleged visibly intoxicated person by name and address.\n\n(ii) States all of the following:\n\n(A) The date of the alleged violation of subsection (1).\n\n(B) The name and address of the injured or killed individual.\n\n(C) The location and circumstances of the accident or event that caused injury or death.\n\n(D) The date of retention of the person or law firm giving the notice.\n\nHistory:Add. 2021, Act 55, Eff.
