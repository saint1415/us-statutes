      "text": "The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development regulates the processing, distribution, and sale of hemp, while the Marijuana Regulatory Agency regulates the processing, distribution, and sale of marijuana.\n\nConsolidating the regulation of the processing, distribution and sale of marijuana and hemp into a single state agency will allow for more effective and efficient administration and enforcement of state laws relating to cannabis. The expertise of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development necessitates their continued regulation of the cultivation of hemp.\n\nChanging the organization of the executive branch of state government is necessary in the interests of efficient administration and effectiveness of government.\n\nSection 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the governor.\n\nSection 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that are necessary for efficient administration.\n\nActing under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:\n\n1.

Section 8 of the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act (\"MRTMA\"), 2018 IL 1, MCL 333.27958, grants the Agency the authority to promulgate rules to regulate the cultivation, processing, distribution, and sale of industrial hemp.\n\n(b) The authorities, powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of the Agency to promulgate rules to regulate the cultivation of industrial hemp under section 8 of MRTMA are transferred by Type II transfer to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\n(c) The Agency must exercise all of the authorities, powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities transferred to the Agency by this order or otherwise vested in the Agency by law.\n\n(d) The Agency is responsible for implementing the transfers to the Agency under this order and has the powers and duties necessary to exercise the powers and duties vested in the Agency by this order or otherwise by law.\n\n3.
