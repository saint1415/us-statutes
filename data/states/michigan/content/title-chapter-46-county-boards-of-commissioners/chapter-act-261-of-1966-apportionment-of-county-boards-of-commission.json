Mar. 28, 2012Constitutionality:The Michigan Supreme Court reversed a Court of Appeals ruling which held that the first sentence in section 1(2) of 2011 PA 280, MCL 46.401, violates section 29 of article IV of the state constitution of 1963. The Court of Appeals ruled that the provision constituted an improperly enacted local act and should be stricken from the act (Frank Houston et al. v Governor and Oakland County Board of Commissioners, Nos. 308724 and 308725). The Michigan Supreme Court, in its holding that the law is constitutional, stated that while the law may apply only to Oakland county immediately, the law could apply to any county in the future that meets the population requirements.",
