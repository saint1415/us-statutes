MILLIKEN, Governor of the State of Michigan, pursuant to the authority vested in me by Article V, Section 2, of the Constitution of the State of Michigan, do hereby order the following:\n\nSection 1.

All other functions and authority, including but not limited to all non-highway related functions, shall be retained by the Public Service Commission.\n\nSection 3. Of the total of 138 positions currently appropriated in fiscal year 1981-82 for motor carrier enforcement related responsibilities, the equivalent of 133 positions are transferred to the Department of State Police to perform the functions set forth above. The equivalent of 5 positions are retained by the Public Service Commission to provide the non-highway enforcement and investigative activity essential to the achievement of comprehensive motor carrier regulation.\n\nSection 4. Except as provided in Section 3, all records, property, personnel and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations and other funds used, held, employed, available, or to be made available to the Michigan Public Service Commission for the activities transferred to the Department of State Police by this Order are hereby transferred to the Department of State Police.\n\nSection 5. After the effective date of this order, the Department of Commerce and the Department of State Police shall make internal organizational changes as may be administratively necessary to complete the realignment of responsibilities prescribed by this order. It is intended, however, that the personnel changes authorized by this order shall be achieved without adversely affecting the existing rights and interests of individual employees.\n\nIn fulfillment of the requirement of Article V, Section 2, of the Constitution of the State of Michigan, the provisions of this Executive Order shall become effective October 1, 1982.\n\nHistory:1982, E.R.O.
