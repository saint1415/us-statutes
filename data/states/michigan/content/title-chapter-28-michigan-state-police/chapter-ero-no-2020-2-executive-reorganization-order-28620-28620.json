      "text": "Effective policing that promotes safety, security, and justice for all Michiganders requires participation in setting policing standards from a broad range of individuals, including Michigan residents from outside the law enforcement community.\n\nAdding members to the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards, which develops the licensing and training standards for law enforcement officers in this state, will bring a more diverse range of voices to this important task and promote democratic accountability.\n\nSection 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the governor.\n\nSection 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that the governor considers necessary for efficient administration.\n\nActing under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:\n\n1. The Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (the Commission) created by section 3 of the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards Act (the MCOLES Act), 1965 PA 203, as amended, MCL 28.603, is expanded to include the following additional members:\n\n(a) The director of the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, or his or her designated representative from within that department.\n\n(b) Three residents of this state appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Michigan Senate.\n\n2. A member appointed under section 1(b) of this order must not be a law enforcement officer, a Michigan tribal law enforcement officer, or be employed by or otherwise affiliated with a law enforcement agency or a law enforcement training academy.\n\n3. Of the Commission members initially appointed under section 1(b) of this order, one must be appointed for an initial term expiring on December 31, 2021, one must be appointed for an initial term expiring on December 31, 2022, and one must be appointed for an initial term expiring on December 31, 2023. After the initial term, the members will be appointed for terms of four years. A vacancy occurring other than by expiration of a term will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment for the remainder of the unexpired term.\n\n4. As used in this order, \"law enforcement agency\", \"law enforcement officer\", \"law enforcement training academy\", and \"Michigan tribal law enforcement officer\" mean those terms as defined in section 2 of the MCOLES Act, MCL 28.602.\n\n5. Consistent with section 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, this order is effective on August 12, 2020 at 12:01 a.m.\n\nHistory:2020, E.R.O. No. 2020-2, Eff.
