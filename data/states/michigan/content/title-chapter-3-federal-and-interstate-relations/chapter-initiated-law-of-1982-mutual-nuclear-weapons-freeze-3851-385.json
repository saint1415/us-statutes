      "text": "Finding and Declarations. We, the people of the State of Michigan, do hereby find and declare that the safety and security of the United States must be paramount in the concerns of the American people. The substantial and growing danger of nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, which would result in millions of deaths of the people of Michigan and throughout the nation, can be reduced by an agreement that both countries immediately halt the testing, production, and further deployment of all nuclear weapons, missiles, and delivery systems in a way that can be checked and verified by both sides. This measure is necessary to reduce the threat of nuclear war to the health and well-being of the citizens of Michigan and the entire country. This measure is also necessary to increase the economic well-being of the people of the State of Michigan, whose economy is adversely effected by money needlessly spent of nuclear weapons systems.\n\nHistory:1982, Initiated Law, Eff.
