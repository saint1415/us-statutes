The interlocal agreement may also provide a method or formula equitably providing for and allocating revenues derived from a federal or state grant or loan, or from a gift, bequest, grant, or loan from a private source.

This subsection does not extend the time limits as provided in subsection (5).\n\n(9) If multiple labor organizations assert the right to represent all or part of the workforce of the joint exercise of power or where a substantial portion of the transferred employees were not previously represented, in the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, at the request of any party or on the initiative of the Michigan employment relations commission, the Michigan employment relations commission shall conduct a representation election.\n\n(10) In the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, the workforce of the joint exercise of power shall be merged by using a single seniority list for each of the same or similar classifications.

Disputes concerning the single seniority list or use of the single seniority list shall be heard by a single arbitrator appointed by the Michigan employment relations commission.\n\n(11) Nothing in this section requires a public agency or a joint exercise of power to assume a collective bargaining agreement between another public agency and its employees.\n\nHistory:1967, Ex.
