A local government shall initiate the neutral evaluation process by providing notice by certified mail of a request for neutral evaluation process to all interested parties. If the local government does not provide notice under this subsection to all interested parties within 7 days after selecting the neutral evaluation process option, the treasurer may require the local government to go into receivership and proceed under section 9.\n\n(2) An interested party shall respond within 10 business days of receipt of notice of the local government's request for neutral evaluation process.\n\n(3) The local government and the interested parties agreeing to participate in the neutral evaluation process shall, through a mutually agreed-upon process, select a neutral evaluator to oversee the neutral evaluation process and facilitate all discussions in an effort to resolve their disputes.\n\n(4) If the local government and interested parties fail to agree on a neutral evaluator within 7 days after the interested parties have responded to the notification sent by the local government, the local government shall, within 7 days, select 5 qualified neutral evaluators and provide their names, references, and backgrounds to the participating interested parties. Within 3 business days, a majority of participating interested parties may disqualify up to 4 names from the list. If a majority of participating interested parties disqualify 4 names from the list, the remaining candidate shall be the neutral evaluator. If the majority of participating parties disqualify fewer than 4 names, the local government shall choose which of the remaining candidates shall be the neutral evaluator.\n\n(5) If an interested party objects to the qualifications of the neutral evaluator after the process for selection in subsection (4) is complete, the interested party may appeal to the state treasurer to determine if the neutral evaluator meets the qualifications under subsection (6). If the state treasurer determines that the qualifications have been met, the neutral evaluation process shall continue. If the state treasurer determines that the qualifications have not been met, the state treasurer shall select the neutral evaluator.\n\n(6) A neutral evaluator shall have experience and training in conflict resolution and alternative dispute resolution and have at least 1 of the following qualifications:\n\n(a) At least 10 years of high-level business or legal experience involving bankruptcy or service as a United States bankruptcy judge.\n\n(b) At least 10 years of combined professional experience or training in municipal finance in 1 or more of the following areas:\n\n(i) Municipal organization.\n\n(ii) Municipal debt restructuring.\n\n(iii) Municipal finance dispute resolution.\n\n(iv) Chapter 9 bankruptcy.\n\n(v) Public finance.\n\n(vi) Taxation.\n\n(vii) Michigan constitutional law.\n\n(viii) Michigan labor law.\n\n(ix) Federal labor law.\n\n(7) The neutral evaluator's performance shall be impartial, objective, independent, and free from prejudice. The neutral evaluator shall not act with partiality or prejudice based on any participant's personal characteristics, background, values, or beliefs, or performance during the neutral evaluation process.\n\n(8) The neutral evaluator shall avoid a conflict of interest and the appearance of a conflict of interest during the neutral evaluation process. The neutral evaluator shall make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether there are any facts that a reasonable individual would consider likely to create a potential or actual conflict of interest. Notwithstanding subsection (16), if the neutral evaluator is informed of the existence of any facts that a reasonable individual would consider likely to create a potential or actual conflict of interest, the neutral evaluator shall disclose these facts in writing to the local government and all interested parties involved in the neutral evaluation process. If any participating interested party to the neutral evaluation process objects to the neutral evaluator, that interested party shall notify the local government and all other participating interested parties to the neutral evaluation process, including the neutral evaluator, within 15 days of receipt of the notice from the neutral evaluator. The neutral evaluator shall withdraw, and a new neutral evaluator shall be selected as provided in subsections (3) and (4).\n\n(9) Before commencing a neutral evaluation process, the neutral evaluator shall not establish another fiscal or fiduciary relationship with any of the interested parties or the local government in a manner that would raise questions about the integrity of the neutral evaluation process, except that the neutral evaluator may conduct further neutral evaluation processes regarding other potential local public entities that may involve some of the same or similar constituents to a prior mediation.\n\n(10) The neutral evaluator shall conduct the neutral evaluation process in a manner that promotes voluntary, uncoerced decision making in which each participant makes free and informed choices regarding the neutral evaluation process and outcome.\n\n(11) The neutral evaluator shall not impose a settlement on the participants. The neutral evaluator shall use his or her best efforts to assist the participants to reach a satisfactory resolution of their disputes. Subject to the discretion of the neutral evaluator, the neutral evaluator may make oral or written recommendations for a settlement or plan of readjustment to a participant privately or to all participants jointly.\n\n(12) The neutral evaluator shall inform the local government and all participants of the provisions of chapter 9 relative to other chapters of title 11 of the United States Code, 11 USC 101 to 1532. This instruction shall highlight the limited authority of United States bankruptcy judges in chapter 9, including, but not limited to, the restriction on federal bankruptcy judges' authority to interfere with or force liquidation of a local government's property and the lack of flexibility available to federal bankruptcy judges to reduce or cram down debt repayments and similar efforts not available to reorganize the operations of the local government that may be available to a corporate entity.\n\n(13) The neutral evaluator may request from the participants documentation and other information that the neutral evaluator believes may be helpful in assisting the participants to address the obligations between them. This documentation may include the status of funds of the local government that clearly distinguishes between general funds and special funds and the proposed plan of readjustment prepared by the local government. The participants shall respond to a request from the neutral evaluator in a timely manner.\n\n(14) The neutral evaluator shall provide counsel and guidance to all participants, shall not be a legal representative of any participant, and shall not have a fiduciary duty to any participant.\n\n(15) If a settlement with all interested parties and the local government occurs, the neutral evaluator may assist the participants in negotiating a pre-petitioned, pre-agreed-upon plan of readjustment in connection with a potential chapter 9 filing.\n\n(16) If at any time during the neutral evaluation process the local government and a majority of the representatives of the interested parties participating in the neutral evaluation process wish to remove the neutral evaluator, the local government or any interested party may make a request to the other interested parties to remove the neutral evaluator.

Each representative shall have the authority to settle and resolve disputes or shall be in a position to present any proposed settlement or plan of readjustment to the participants in the neutral evaluation process.\n\n(19) The local government and the participating interested parties shall maintain the confidentiality of the neutral evaluation process and shall not at the conclusion of the neutral evaluation process or during any bankruptcy proceeding disclose statements made, information disclosed, or documents prepared or produced unless a judge in a chapter 9 bankruptcy proceeding orders that the information be disclosed to determine the eligibility of a local government to proceed with a bankruptcy proceeding under chapter 9, or as otherwise required by law.\n\n(20) A neutral evaluation process authorized by this act shall not last for more than 60 days following the date the neutral evaluator is initially selected, unless the local government or a majority of participating interested parties elect to extend the neutral evaluation process for up to 30 additional days.
