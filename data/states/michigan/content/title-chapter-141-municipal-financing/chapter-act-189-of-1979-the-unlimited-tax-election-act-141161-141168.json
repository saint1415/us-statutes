After this vote of approval the public corporation may levy, for payment of these obligations, ad valorem taxes on all taxable property within its boundaries without regard to a charter, statutory, or constitutional tax limitation, and in addition to other taxes which the public corporation may be authorized to levy. However, the tax which may be levied shall not be excess of a rate or amount sufficient for payment of the obligations.\n\nHistory:1979, Act 189, Imd. Eff. Dec. 21, 1979",
