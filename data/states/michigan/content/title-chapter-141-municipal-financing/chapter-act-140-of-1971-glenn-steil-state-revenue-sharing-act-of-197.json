share of the distribution amounts calculated under subsections (8), (9), and (10).\n\n(12) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the total payment to any city, village, or township under this act and section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 shall not increase by more than 8% over the amount of the payment under this act and section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 in the immediately preceding state fiscal year. From the amount not distributed because of the limitation imposed by this subsection, the department shall distribute an amount to certain cities, villages, and townships such that the percentage increase in the total payment under this act and section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 from the immediately preceding state fiscal year to each of those cities, villages, and townships is equal to, but does not exceed, the percentage increase from the immediately preceding state fiscal year of any city, village, or township that does not receive a distribution under this subsection. This subsection does not apply for state fiscal years after the 2000 federal decennial census becomes official to a city, village, or township with a 10% or more increase in population from the official 1990 federal decennial census to the official 2000 federal decennial census.\n\n(13) The percentage allocations to distributions under subsections (8) to (10) pursuant to subsection (11) shall be calculated as if, in any state fiscal year, the amount appropriated under this section for distribution to cities, villages, and townships is 74.94% of 21.3% of the sales tax at a rate of 4%. If the amount appropriated under this section to cities, villages, and townships is less than 74.94% of 21.3% of the sales tax at a rate of 4%, any reduction made necessary by this appropriation in distributions to cities, villages, and townships shall first be applied to the distribution under subsections (8) to (10) and any remaining amount shall be applied to the other distributions under this section.\n\n(14) A township that provides for or makes available fire, police on a 24-hour basis either through contracting for or directly employing personnel, water to 50% or more of its residents, and sewer services to 50% or more of its residents and has a population of 10,000 or more or a township that has a population of 20,000 or more shall use the unit type population weight factor under subsection (9)(a) for a city with the same population as the township.\n\n(15) For a state fiscal year in which the sales tax collections decrease from the sales tax collections for the immediately preceding state fiscal year, the department shall reduce the amount to be distributed to a city with a population of 750,000 or more under subsection (6) by an amount determined by subtracting the amount the city is eligible for under section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 for the state fiscal year from $333,900,000.00 and multiplying that result by the same percentage as the percentage decrease in sales tax collections for that state fiscal year as compared to sales tax collections for the immediately preceding state fiscal year. This subsection does not apply to the 2002-2003 through 2006-2007 state fiscal years.\n\n(16) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section for the 1998-1999 state fiscal year, the total combined amount received by each city, village, and township under this section and section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 shall not be less than the combined amount received under this section, section 12a, and section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 in the 1997-1998 state fiscal year. The increase, if any, for each city, village, and township from the 1997-1998 state fiscal year, other than a city that receives a distribution under subsection (6), shall be reduced by a uniform percentage to the extent necessary to fund distributions under this subsection.\n\n(17) The payments under subsections (3), (4), and (5) shall be made during each October, December, February, April, June, and August. Payments under subsections (3), (4), and (5) shall be based on collections from the sales tax at the rate of 4% in the 2-month period ending the prior August 31, October 31, December 31, February 28, April 30, and June 30, and for the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 state fiscal years only, the payments shall be reduced by 1/6 of the total distribution for the state fiscal year under section 12a.\n\n(18) Payments under this section shall be made from revenues collected during the state fiscal year in which the payments are made.\n\n(19) Distributions provided for by this act are subject to an annual appropriation by the legislature.\n\n(20) After the department has informed a city, village, or township in writing of the intent to withhold all or a portion of payments under this section and offered the affected city, village, or township an opportunity for an informal conference on the matter, the department of treasury may withhold all or a portion of payments under this section to a city, village, or township that has not distributed 1 or more of the following:\n\n(a) An industrial facilities tax as required under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572.\n\n(b) The specific tax as required under section 21b of the enterprise zone act, 1985 PA 224, MCL 125.2121b.\n\n(c) Any portion of the state education tax levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, or of property taxes levied for any purpose by a local or intermediate school district under the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1852, determined by the state tax commission to have been wrongfully captured and retained to implement a tax increment financing plan under 1975 PA 197, MCL 125.1651 to 125.1681, the tax increment finance authority act, 1980 PA 450, MCL 125.1801 to 125.1830, or the local development financing act, 1986 PA 281, MCL 125.2151 to 125.2174.\n\nHistory:1971, Act 140, Imd.

The department of management and budget shall analyze the reports and shall make recommendations to the legislature regarding other local general fund revenues that the department considers reflective of or equivalent to local tax effort. Other local revenues do not include state or federal shared revenues, block grants, or categorical grants, or grants or gifts from other sources, but do include fees or charges imposed by the city, village, or township for municipal purposes.\n\n(3) The department of treasury shall report to the department of management and budget the tax collections available for distribution. The department of management and budget may make the distribution in a single warrant. A millage rate certified to be levied for a city, village, or township of 1 mill or more that is reduced below 1 mill pursuant to section 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, pursuant to section 34 of Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, or because the city, village, or township did not elect to increase the millage rate permitted by operation of section 24e(2) of Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, or due to any combination of these factors, shall be considered by the department of management and budget to be 1 mill for all of the following purposes:\n\n(a) Payments under sections 12(2) and 15, which payments shall be calculated using the actual local property taxes.\n\n(b) Determining whether the city, village, or township is eligible under section 14 for payments based upon the tax burden formula, which formula shall be calculated using the actual local property taxes.\n\n(c) Determining whether the city, village, or township is eligible under section 14a for payments based upon the special census formula, which formula shall be calculated using the actual local property taxes.\n\nHistory:1971, Act 140, Imd.

Upon request of a local unit of government the department of treasury may assist that local unit in the formulation of the financial plan to correct the deficit condition.
