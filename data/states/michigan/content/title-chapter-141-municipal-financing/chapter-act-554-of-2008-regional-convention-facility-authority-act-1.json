In discharging his or her duties, a board member or an officer, employee, or agent of an authority, when acting in good faith, may rely upon any of the following:\n\n(a) The opinion of counsel for the authority.\n\n(b) The report of an independent appraiser selected by the board.\n\n(c) Financial statements of the authority represented to the member of the board, officer, employee, or agent to be correct by the officer of the authority having charge of its books of account or stated in a written report by the state auditor general or a certified public accountant, or a firm of certified accountants, to reflect the financial condition of the authority.\n\n(2) A board shall organize and make its own policies and procedures and shall adopt bylaws not inconsistent with this act governing its operations. The board shall meet at the call of the chairperson and as may be provided in the bylaws.\n\n(3) A member of a board or an officer, appointee, or employee of an authority shall not be subject to personal liability when acting in good faith within the scope of his or her authority or on account of liability of the authority, and the board may indemnify a member of the board or an officer, appointee, or employee of the authority against liability arising out of the discharge of his or her official duties. An authority may indemnify and procure insurance indemnifying members of the board and other officers and employees of the authority from personal loss or accountability for liability asserted by a person with regard to bonds or other obligations of the authority, or from any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the bonds or other obligations or by reason of any other action taken or the failure to act by the authority. The authority also may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any capacity or arising out of the status of the person as a member of the board or an officer or employee of the authority, whether or not the authority would have the power to indemnify the person against that liability under this section. An authority, pursuant to bylaw, contract, agreement, or resolution of its board, may obligate itself in advance to indemnify persons.\n\n(4) Board members and officers and employees of an authority are public servants subject to 1968 PA 317, MCL 15.321 to 15.330, and are subject to any other applicable law with respect to conflicts of interest. A board shall establish policies and procedures requiring periodic disclosure of relationships which may give rise to conflicts of interest. The board shall require that a board member or chief executive officer of the authority with a direct interest in any matter before the authority disclose the board member's or officer's interest and any reasons reasonably known to the board member or officer why the transaction may not be in the best interest of the public or the authority before the board takes any action with respect to the matter. The disclosure shall become part of the record of an authority's proceedings.\n\n(5) An authority shall establish an ethics manual governing the conducting of authority business and the conduct of authority officers and employees. An authority shall establish policies that are no less stringent than those provided for public officers and employees by 1973 PA 196, MCL 15.341 to 15.348, and coordinate efforts for the authority to preclude the opportunity for and the occurrence of transactions by the authority that would create a conflict of interest involving board members and officers or employees of the authority. At a minimum, the policies shall include compliance by each board member and officer or employees who regularly exercises significant discretion over the award and management of authority procurements with policies governing all of the following:\n\n(a) Immediate disclosure of the existence and nature of any financial interest that could reasonably be expected to create a conflict of interest.\n\n(b) Withdrawal by an employee, officer, or board member from participation in or discussion or evaluation of any recommendation or decision involving an authority procurement that would reasonably be expected to create a conflict of interest for that employee or member.\n\n(c) Annual public financial disclosure of significant financial interests as provided under this act.\n\n(6) The appointing authority of a board member may remove the board member from office for gross neglect of duty, corrupt conduct in office, or any other misfeasance or malfeasance in office.\n\n(7) Each member of the board of an authority, the chief executive officer, and each key employee as determined by the board shall file with the secretary of state a financial disclosure statement listing assets and liabilities, property and business interests, and sources of income of the member, chief executive officer, and each key employee and any of their spouses in a form determined by the secretary of state. The financial disclosure statement shall be under oath and shall be filed at the time of appointment or employment and annually thereafter. The secretary of state may promulgate rules under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, to provide for the implementation of this subsection.\n\n(8) A member of the board of an authority or employee of an authority shall not hold any direct or indirect interest in, be employed by, or enter into a contract for services with any entity doing business with the authority for a period of 2 years after the date his or her membership on the board terminates or his or her employment with the authority terminates.\n\nHistory:2008, Act 554, Eff.

If the authority refunds the outstanding securities assumed under this subsection, that refunding shall be considered, as a matter of law, to be necessary to eliminate requirements of covenants applicable to the existing outstanding securities.\n\n(2) An authority shall assume, accept, or become liable for lawful agreements, obligations, promises, covenants, commitments, and other requirements of a local government relating to operating a qualified convention facility conveyed and transferred under this section, except as provided in subsection (4).

If a qualified convention facility is leased to an authority under subsection (1), this subsection shall apply while the lease agreement is effective.\n\n(10) A local government that owns a qualified convention facility subject to transfer or lease under this section or that owned a qualified convention facility transferred to an authority under this section shall comply with all of the following, before and after the transfer date:\n\n(a) Refrain from any action to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a qualified convention facility other than to the authority or incur new or expanded obligations related to a qualified convention facility, without the consent of the authority.\n\n(b) Refrain from any approval of or material modification to any collective bargaining agreement applicable to local government employees employed at or assigned to the qualified convention facility or to terms of employment for employees at or assigned to the qualified convention facility.

      "text": "(1) The authority, as of the transfer date, immediately shall assume and be bound by any existing collective bargaining agreements applicable to employees of the local government whose employment is transferred to the authority either as a result of the authority's express assumption of the employees or by application of section 19 for the remainder of the term of the collective bargaining agreement. Local government employees whose employment is not transferred to the authority shall be reassigned within the local government, pursuant to the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements. A representative of the employees or a group of employees in the local government who represents or is entitled to represent the employees or a group of employees of the local government pursuant to 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217, shall continue to represent the employee or group of employees after the employees transfer to the authority. This subsection does not limit the rights of employees, pursuant to applicable law, to assert that a bargaining representative protected by this subsection is no longer their representative. The rights and benefits protected by this subsection may be altered by a future collective bargaining agreement or, for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements, by benefit plans as established and adopted by the authority.\n\n(2) Transferred employees shall not by reason of the transfer have their accrued local government pension benefits or credits diminished. If a transferring employee is not vested in his or her local government pension rights at the time of transfer, his or her posttransfer service with the authority shall be credited toward vesting in any local government retirement system in which the transferring employee participated prior to the transfer, but posttransfer service with the authority shall not be credited for any other purpose under the local government's retirement system, except as provided in subsection (4).\n\n(3) A transferred local government employee described in this section or a person hired by the authority as a new employee after the transfer date may remain or become a participant in the local government retirement system until the authority has established its own retirement system or pension plan. During the period the employee remains or is a participant in the local government system, the employee's posttransfer service with the authority and his or her posttransfer compensation from the authority shall be counted in determining both eligibility for and the amount of pension benefits that the employee will be eligible to receive from the local government system or plan.\n\n(4) If the local government maintains a retirement system that provides for continuing participation and benefit accrual by local government employees who transfer their employment to another entity in conjunction with transfer of a local government function to that entity, then the transferred employee may elect to remain a participant in the local government retirement system in lieu of participation in any retirement system or pension plan of the authority. If the transferred employee elects to remain a participant in the local government system, the employee's posttransfer service with the authority and his or her posttransfer compensation from the authority shall be counted in determining both eligibility for and the amount of pension benefits that the employee will be eligible to receive from the local government system or plan. Any election to remain in a local government system or plan shall be made within 60 days following the date the authority has established its own retirement system or pension plan and shall be irrevocable. Employees eligible to make the election described in this subsection shall be those employees who immediately before their transfer date were participating in the local government system and who agree to make any employee contributions required for continuing participation in the local government system and also agree to meet all requirements and be subject to all conditions that, from time to time, apply to employees of the local government who participate in the local government system.\n\n(5) For each employee meeting the requirements of subsection (4) who elects to remain a participant in the local government retirement system, the authority shall, on a timely basis, contribute, as applicable, to the trustees of that retirement system an amount determined by the local government system's actuary to be sufficient to fund the liability for all of that employee's retirement and other postemployment benefits under the system on a current basis, as those liabilities are accrued from and after the transfer date.\n\nHistory:2008, Act 554, Eff.
