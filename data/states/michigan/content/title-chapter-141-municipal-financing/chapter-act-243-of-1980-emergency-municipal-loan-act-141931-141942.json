Repayment of all of the principal shall be made not more than 30 years from the date of issuance determined by the board or state treasurer under section 6a, except as provided in subsection (5). This subsection, section 7, and the conditions listed in section 4(1) do not apply to a loan authorized under section 3(2) or (3).\n\n(3) The loan agreement between the board and a county for a loan authorized under section 3(2) or (3) shall establish the schedule for payment of the principal of and interest on the loan, the nature of the obligation of the county to repay a loan made under this act, and any security for that loan. Payments of principal and interest for a loan authorized by section 3(2) shall be limited to revenues allocated to the county under the health and safety fund act, 1987 PA 264, MCL 141.471 to 141.479, minus those revenues authorized by the board in the loan agreement for use in the payment of other county obligations.\n\n(4) Unless other state appropriations to a municipality are pledged or assigned in an amount sufficient for the municipality to make a required principal or interest payment, if the municipality's payment of required principal or interest is delinquent, the state treasurer may withhold the amount of all delinquent payments that are due on a loan issued under this act from state payments to the municipality under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, or from the municipality's portion of the revenue generated by the local community stabilization share tax levied under the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.91 to 205.111, and payable by the department of treasury to the local community stabilization authority created under the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1341 to 123.1362, for distribution to the municipality or other governmental entities, or both.\n\n(5) Except for loans sold or transferred under section 6a or as otherwise determined by the board, notwithstanding the payment schedules and methods established by this section or by the terms of a loan agreement, a municipality may initiate repayment of all or part of a loan made under this act at an earlier date or may make repayment in fewer installment payments, or both. The board shall not condition either eligibility for consideration for a loan or the grant of a loan under this act on repayment schedules and terms other than those required by subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4). In addition, failure of a municipality to make repayments under terms or a schedule it has instituted under this subsection does not disqualify the municipality from eligibility for consideration for loans in subsequent fiscal years.\n\n(6) A loan issued under this act shall be a general obligation of the municipality except that a loan issued under section 3(2) shall not be a general obligation of the municipality and shall be repaid solely from specific revenues pledged for repayment of the loan.\n\nHistory:1980, Act 243, Imd.
