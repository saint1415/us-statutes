The state transportation department may accept facilities or in-kind services to be used for public purposes in lieu of, or in addition to, monetary compensation.\n\n(10) This section does not prohibit the use of logo signage within the right-of-way of limited access highways.

The signs shall indicate the name of the hospital or the name of the nonprofit corporation that owns or operates the hospital and the exit number of the exit that is within the 2 miles of the hospital. At least 1 sign shall be placed for each exit that is within 2 miles of a requesting hospital that provides 24-hour emergency care.
