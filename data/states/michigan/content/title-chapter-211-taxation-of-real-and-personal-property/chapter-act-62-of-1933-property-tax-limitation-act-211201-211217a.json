The ballots must state the amount in dollars per thousand dollars of taxable value by which it is proposed that the total tax rate limitation on property in the local unit be increased and the number of years for which it is proposed that the increase will be effective. If a previous increase in the total tax limitation on property is about to expire and a new increase for the identical amount levied in the immediately preceding year or a lesser amount is proposed, the ballot proposal may be presented as a renewal or continuation of the previous increase for a specified number of years. The ballot must specify the intended purpose of the renewed or new funds. The ballot may also state the purpose for which the funds derived from the voted increase over the constitutional tax rate limitation may be used, and the board shall not consider those funds in dividing the net limitation tax rate among the various governmental units under this act. Within 5 days after every election held in any local unit to increase the tax rate limitation, a certified copy of the official declaration of the result of the election must be filed with the treasurer of the county or counties in which the local unit is located. The voted increase in the tax rate limitation is effective in the local unit only when the certified copy of the official declaration of the result of the election is filed. The notice of an election under section 653a of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.653a, for an election at which a proposal for an increase in the total tax rate limitation is to be voted upon must, in addition to listing the proposal, include a statement that includes the amount in dollars per thousand dollars of taxable value by which it is proposed under the proposal that the total tax rate limitation on property in the local unit be increased and the number of years for which it is proposed that the increase will be effective.\n\n(4) As used in this section, \"taxable value\" means that value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.\n\nHistory:1933, Act 62, Imd.

In submitting the budget to the board, the amount contained in the budget stabilization fund shall not be a factor used by the board in determination of the tax rate, if that amount does not exceed the permitted level of funding for that fund as provided by law.\n\n(2) If the board finds that the total of all tax rates that are required to be levied on property located within the area of a local unit does not exceed the net limitation tax rate, the board shall approve the tax rates as maximum tax rates, except tax rates required to be determined under subsections (3) to (8).\n\n(3) If the board finds that the total of all tax rates that are required to be levied on property located within the area of a local unit exceeds the net limitation tax rate, the board shall proceed according to subsections (4), (5), and (6).\n\n(4) The board shall approve minimum tax rates for the county if other than a charter county, of 3 mills; for community college districts organized after April 15, 1957, of 1/4 of 1 mill; for intermediate school districts, 1/10 of 1 mill; for townships other than charter townships, of 1 mill; and to a first-class school district to be collected and paid by the school district to the public library commission existing in the district for services of an educational nature rendered by the library to the residents of that school district, of .64 mills.
