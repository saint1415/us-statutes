If a recapture tax is imposed on the owner of the property under this subsection, the recapture tax is a lien on the property subject to the recapture tax until paid. If the recapture tax is not paid within 90 days of the date the property was converted by a change in use, the treasurer may bring a civil action against the owner of the property as of the date the property was converted by a change in use. If the recapture tax remains unpaid on the March 1 in the year immediately succeeding the year in which the property is converted by a change in use, the property on which the recapture tax is due shall be returned as delinquent to the county treasurer of the county in which the property is located. Property returned as delinquent under this section, and upon which the recapture tax, interest, penalties, and fees remain unpaid after the property is returned as delinquent to the county treasurer, is subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale for the enforcement and collection of the delinquent taxes as provided in sections 78 to 79a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78 to 211.79a.\n\n(3) If a recapture tax is imposed because qualified agricultural property is converted by a change in use as described in section 2(c)(ii), the recapture tax is an obligation of the person who owned the property prior to the transfer and the recapture tax is due when the instruments transferring the property are recorded with the register of deeds. The register of deeds shall not record an instrument transferring the property before the recapture tax is paid.\n\nHistory:2000, Act 261, Imd. Eff. June 29, 2000",
