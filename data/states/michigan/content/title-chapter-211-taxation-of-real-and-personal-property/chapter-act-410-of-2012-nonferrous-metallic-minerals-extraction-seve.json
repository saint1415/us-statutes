As used in this section, contiguity is not broken by a road, an easement, a right-of-way, or property occupied by power transmission lines or buffer zones. Mineral-producing property also includes all the following within this state:\n\n(i) Mineral rights in mineral-producing property.\n\n(ii) Mineral leases, options, and mining rights on or in mineral-producing property.\n\n(iii) Mineral stockpiles and mineral inventories that are owned, leased, or controlled by a taxpayer.\n\n(iv) Leach pads, waste rock repositories, and tailings impounds that are owned, leased, or controlled by a taxpayer.\n\n(v) Buffer lands that are owned, leased, or controlled by a taxpayer and are appurtenant to mineral-producing property. For purposes of determining appurtenance to mineral-producing property for buffer lands owned, leased, or controlled by a taxpayer, there is a rebuttable presumption that all of the following apply:\n\n(A) Land that is no more than 1/4 mile from nonbuffer land mineral-producing property, is held by the taxpayer for use as buffer land.\n\n(B) Land that is more than 1/4 mile from nonbuffer land mineral-producing property and that a taxpayer is required to own, lease, or control due to requirements imposed by federal, state, or local law, is held by the taxpayer for use as buffer land.\n\n(vi) Buildings, improvements, fixtures, and nonmobile equipment located upon, beneath, or appurtenant to a mine, including administrative and support facilities appurtenant to a mine provided that such property is located upon, beneath, or on a parcel that is a mineral-producing property.\n\n(vii) Property owned and primarily used by the taxpayer in the transportation of minerals from a producing mine to the point where beneficiation activities begin.\n\n(viii) Property used for beneficiation of extracted minerals if the person that owns or controls the property is a taxpayer.\n\n(e) \"Mineral-producing property\" does not include real and personal property that is used for transportation of minerals between any locations, unless it is specifically described in subdivision (d).

There is a rebuttable presumption that the purchase price of a taxable mineral under a bona fide arm's-length contract of sale or transfer between unrelated persons reflects the taxable mineral value. In determining the taxable mineral value of a taxable mineral for contracts of sale or transfer between related persons, there is a rebuttable presumption that taxable mineral value for related party sales or transfers shall be based on the average daily price of the mineral as quoted on published market indices as of the date of sale or transfer. The taxable mineral value of taxable minerals sold or transferred by a taxpayer following beneficiation shall reflect the total value of the taxable mineral in its beneficiated state. For taxable minerals which are to be shipped or transported outside this state for beneficiation outside this state or otherwise removed by a taxpayer from this state and which are considered to have been sold as provided in section 4(1), the taxable mineral value shall reflect the total value of the minerals immediately prior to the shipment or removal based on the average daily price of the mineral as quoted on published market indices as determined by the department.\n\n(m) \"Taxpayer\" means a person subject to a specific tax levied under this act.\n\n(n) \"Transfer\" means an in-kind exchange or other disposition of an interest in minerals, whether or not beneficiated, other than through a sale.\n\nHistory:2012, Act 410, Imd.
