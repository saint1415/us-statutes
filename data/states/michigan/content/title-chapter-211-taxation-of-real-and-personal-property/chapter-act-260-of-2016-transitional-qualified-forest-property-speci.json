The application process shall include an application from the owner of the forestland on a form created by the department, a forest management plan, and a fee of $50.00. The applicant shall file the application not later than September 1 prior to the tax year in which transitional qualified forest property will be taxed under this act.\n\n(2) The department shall review the application and forest management plan and determine whether the forestland is transitional qualified forest property under this act. The department shall review the forest management plan to determine if the elements required in section 7jj(17)(f) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7jj[1], are in the plan. Within 90 days of its receipt of the application, forest management plan, and fee, the department shall review the application and if the application and supporting documents are not in compliance, the department shall deny the application and notify the property owner of that denial.
