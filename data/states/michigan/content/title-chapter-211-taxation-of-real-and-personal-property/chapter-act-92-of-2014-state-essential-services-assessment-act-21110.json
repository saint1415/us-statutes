This act does not take effect unless Senate Bill No. 822 of the 97th Legislature is approved by a majority of the qualified electors of this state voting on the question at an election to be held on the August regular election date in 2014.\"Enacting section 3 of Act 92 of 2014 provides:\"Enacting section 3. The legislature declares that stable local government funding and a tax system that allows individuals, small businesses, and large businesses to thrive and create jobs in this state are priorities of state government. The legislature also declares that all state priorities should be considered in enacting any legislation that has a fiscal impact and that any costs should be managed in a fiscally responsible way. In furtherance of these objectives, the legislature has reduced the state use tax under section 3 of the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.93, and replaced the portion reduced with a use tax levied by the local community stabilization authority on behalf of local units of government throughout this state to provide more stable funding for local units of government than exists today. It is the intent of the legislature to offset the fiscal impact on the state general fund resulting from the reduction of the state use tax with new revenue generated by the assessment levied under this act and with new revenue resulting from the expiration of over $630,000,000.00 in expiring refundable tax credits that were awarded to individual businesses under tax laws enacted by past legislatures.\"Compiler's Notes:Pursuant to section 34 of article IV of the state constitution of 1963, a legislative referendum on Act 80 of 2014 was presented to the electors as Proposal 14-1 at the August 5, 2014 primary election. The proposal read as follows:“APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF AMENDATORY ACT TO REDUCE STATE USE TAX AND REPLACE WITH A LOCAL COMMUNITY STABILIZATION SHARE TO MODERNIZE THE TAX SYSTEM TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES GROW AND CREATE JOBS The amendatory act adopted by the Legislature would: 1. Reduce the state use tax and replace with a local community stabilization share of the tax for the purpose of modernizing the tax system to help small businesses grow and create jobs in Michigan. 2. Require Local Community Stabilization Authority to provide revenue to local governments dedicated for local purposes, including police safety, fire protection, and ambulance emergency services. 3. Increase portion of state use tax dedicated for aid to local school districts. 4. Prohibit Authority from increasing taxes. 5. Prohibit total use tax rate from exceeding existing constitutional 6% limitation. Should this law be approved?

The department may provide guidelines for circumstances in which the actual acquisition price is not determinative of acquisition cost and the basis of determining acquisition cost in those circumstances. When the acquisition cost, year of acquisition by the first owner, or both are unknown, the department may provide guidelines for estimating the acquisition cost and year of acquisition by the first owner. The department may issue guidelines that allow for the reduction of acquisition cost for property that is idle, is obsolete or has material obsolescence, or is surplus.\n\n(ii) Beginning with the 2017 assessment year, for property that is construction in progress only, \"acquisition cost\" means 1/2 of the fair market value at the time acquired by the first owner, including the cost of freight, sales tax, and installation.
