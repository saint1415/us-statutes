The department shall not pay for any special assessments assessed on or after October 1, 2020. The death of a spouse does not terminate the deferment of special assessments for a homestead owned by a married couple under tenancy by the entireties as long as the surviving spouse does not remarry. Special assessments deferred under this act may be paid in full at any time. Alternatively, an owner may at any time make partial payments on the balance of special assessments owed under section 6, including any interest due on those special assessments, subject to all of the following:\n\n(a) At the owner's discretion, the owner may make as many as 4 partial payments per calendar year in a form and manner prescribed by the department.\n\n(b) A partial payment must be in an amount not less than the greater of the following:\n\n(i) Five percent of the sum of the balance of special assessments owed under section 6 plus interest due on those special assessments.\n\n(ii) $500.00.\n\n(c) Interest continues to accrue on any unpaid balance of special assessments owed under section 6.\n\n(d) Payment is due in full for the balance of special assessments owed under section 6 plus interest due on those special assessments if the owner conveys or transfers the homestead or any part of it, or enters a contract to sell the homestead or any part of it.\n\n(e) Upon the death of the owner, payment is due in full within 1 year for the balance of special assessments owed under section 6 plus interest due on those special assessments.\n\n(2) If the collecting officer or the department determines that legal or equitable title to a homestead or any part of a homestead for which special assessments are deferred under this act is conveyed or transferred or a contract to sell the homestead or part of a homestead is entered into, and the deferment is not terminated, the owner or owner's estate is subject to an interest rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month, on the amount deferred, computed from the date of conveyance, transfer, or contractual agreement. The amount of interest is payable to the collecting officer and must be transmitted by that office pursuant to section 9.\n\n(3) The department shall notify each owner whose special assessments are authorized to be deferred under this act that if legal or equitable title to the homestead or any part of the homestead is conveyed or transferred or a contract to sell the homestead or part of the homestead is entered into, the deferment is terminated and the amount deferred is immediately due and payable, plus interest as provided in subsection (2).\n\nHistory:1976, Act 225, Imd.

The owner and the owner's spouse shall not have received during the last calendar year household income as defined in section 508 of Act No. 281 of the Public Acts of 1967, as amended, being section 206.508 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, in excess of $8,000.00; this amount shall be increased to $10,000.00 for the determination of eligibility for a deferment after December 31, 1982. The gross amount of the special assessment, exclusive of interest, shall not be less than $300.00.\n\n(2) The maximum dollar amount of household income required by subsection (1) to be eligible for the deferment of special assessments under this act shall be adjusted each year beginning on January 1, 1984, pursuant to the annual average percentage increase or decrease in the Detroit consumer price index—all items as defined and reported by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. The adjustment shall be made by multiplying the annual average percentage increase or decrease in the Detroit consumer price index for the prior calendar year by the current maximum dollar amount of the household income requirement as adjusted by this subsection. The resultant product shall be added to the maximum dollar amount of the household income requirement as adjusted by this subsection and then rounded off to the nearest whole number, which shall be the new household income requirement for the current year.\n\n(3) After January 1, 1975, a person 65 years of age or older who otherwise qualifies under this section for deferral of special assessments who fails to pay a prior delinquent special assessment and thereby lost the property to the local unit of government who purchased the property through tax sale may reacquire the property from the local unit of government through a land contract. The land contract for a parcel of property reacquired under the circumstances set forth in this subsection shall be treated as a special assessment for purposes of this act.\n\n(4) The owner of a homestead who is 65 years of age or older or is totally and permanently disabled, a citizen of the United States, a resident of this state for 5 or more years, and the sole owner of the homestead for 5 or more years, in the year the special assessment was levied, and who has borrowed money from a lending institution to pay a special assessment before the effective date of this subsection, shall be eligible to receive money from the special revolving fund created in section 10, to be used for the purpose of repaying the lending institution the principal amount used by the person to pay the special assessment. The department shall cause a lien on the homestead in favor of the state to be recorded with the appropriate register of deeds, indicating the amount of the money paid and identifying the homestead. Money paid from the fund under this subsection shall be treated as if the money had been paid as deferred special assessment.\n\nHistory:1976, Act 225, Imd. Eff.
