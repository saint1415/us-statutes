Dec. 21, 1982Constitutionality:In People v Stanton, 400 Mich. 192; 253 NW2d 650 (1977), the Michigan supreme court declared 1972 PA 105, which amended this section, unconstitutional due to a defect in the title to 1909 PA 17. The law as embodied in the 1972 amendment was voided, not the act title. The amendment of the title by 1977 PA 164 following the declaration of unconstitutionality of a portion of the act itself did not suffice to resurrect the voided portion. If the voided portion is to be once again considered a part of the law, it must be “revised, altered, or amended” and “re-enacted and published at length” pursuant to Const 1963, art IV, § 25. People v Clabin, 411 Mich 472; 307 NW2d 682 (1981). This section and the title to 909 PA 17 were subsequently amended by 1982 PA 343.",
