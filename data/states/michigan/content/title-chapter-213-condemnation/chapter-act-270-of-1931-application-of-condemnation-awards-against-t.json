In case such award shall be insufficient to pay all of such taxes and/or special assessments, such award shall be applied pro rata to the payment of such taxes and/or special assessments, and such payment shall be deemed satisfaction of such taxes and/or special assessments as to the property so taken and the petitioner shall be entitled to a receipt from the proper tax collecting officer or officers so stating. In case title to such property passes, by virtue of such proceedings after the date upon which the assessment roll is required to be completed and before the tax becomes due and payable, the unit of government, board, department or commission that is the petitioner in the condemnation proceeding shall pay such taxes and special assessments when the same become due and payable.
