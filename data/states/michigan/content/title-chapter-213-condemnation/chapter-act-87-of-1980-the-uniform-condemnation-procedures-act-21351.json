      "text": "(1) If the acquisition of a portion of a parcel of property actually needed by an agency would destroy the practical value or utility of the remainder of that parcel, the agency shall pay just compensation for the whole parcel. The agency may elect whether to receive title and possession of the remainder of the parcel. The question as to whether the practical value or utility of the remainder of the parcel of property is in fact destroyed shall be determined by the court or jury and incorporated in its verdict.\n\n(2) If the acquisition of a portion of a parcel of property actually needed by an agency would leave the remainder of the parcel in nonconformity with a zoning ordinance, the agency, before or after acquisition, may apply for a zoning variance for the remainder of the parcel. In determining whether to grant the zoning variance, the governmental entity having jurisdiction to grant the variance shall consider the potential benefits of the public use for which the property would be acquired, in addition to those criteria applicable under the relevant zoning statute, ordinance, or regulation. The agency must actually acquire the portion of the parcel of property for the proposed public use for the zoning variance to become effective for the remainder. If a variance is granted under this subsection, the property shall be considered by the governmental entity to be in conformity with the zoning ordinance for all future uses with respect to the nonconformity for which that variance was granted. However, if the property was also nonconforming for other reasons, the grant of that variance has no effect on the status of those other preexisting nonconformities. An owner shall not increase the nonconformity for which a variance is granted under this section without the consent of the governmental entity. An agency has the same right to appeal action on a zoning variance as would a property owner seeking a zoning variance. This section does not deprive a governmental entity of its discretion to grant or deny a variance.\n\n(3) An agency or an agent or employee of an agency may enter upon property before filing an action for the purpose of making surveys, measurements, examinations, tests, soundings, and borings; taking photographs or samplings; appraising the property; conducting an environmental inspection; conducting archaeological studies pursuant to section 106 of title I of the national historic preservation act, Public Law 89-665, 16 U.S.C. 470f; or determining whether the property is suitable to take for public purposes. The entry may be made upon reasonable notice to the owner and at reasonable hours. An entry made pursuant to this subsection shall not be construed as a taking. The owner or his or her representative shall be given a reasonable opportunity to accompany the agency's agent or employee during the entry upon the property. The agency shall make restitution for actual damage resulting from the entry, which may be recovered by special motion before the court or by separate action if an action for condemnation has not been filed. The term \"actual damage\" as used in this subsection does not include, and an agency shall not make restitution for, response activity, as defined in section 20101 of part 201 (environmental remediation) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being section 324.20101 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or diminution in the value or utility of a parcel that is caused by the discovery of information as the result of a survey, an appraisal, a measurement, photography, or an environmental inspection made pursuant to this section.\n\n(4) If reasonable efforts to enter under subsection (3) have been obstructed or denied, the agency may commence a civil action in the circuit court in the county in which the property or any part of the property is located for an order permitting entry. The complaint shall state the facts making the entry necessary, the date on which entry is sought, and the duration and the method proposed for protecting the defendant against damage. The court may grant a limited license for entry upon such terms as justice and equity require, including the following:\n\n(a) A description of the purpose of the entry.\n\n(b) The scope of activities that are permitted.\n\n(c) The terms and conditions of the entry with respect to the time, place, and manner of the entry.\n\n(5) An entry made under subsection (3) or (4) shall be made in a manner that minimizes any damage to the property and any hardship, burden, or damage to a person in lawful possession of the property.\n\n(6) As used in this section, \"environmental inspection\" means the testing or inspection including the taking of samples of the soil, groundwater, structures, or other materials or substances in, on, or under the property for the purpose of determining whether chemical, bacteriological, radioactive, or other environmental contamination exists and, if it exists, the nature and extent of the contamination.\n\nHistory:1980, Act 87, Imd.

      "text": "(1) Before initiating negotiations for the purchase of property, the agency shall establish an amount that it believes to be just compensation for the property and promptly shall submit to the owner a good faith written offer to acquire the property for the full amount so established. At the same time, if the taking of the property might require relocation, the agency shall provide written notice to the occupants of the property stating that an eminent domain proceeding has commenced and outlining the occupants' basic legal rights in the process, including, but not limited to, the fact that any person who has a leasehold interest of less than 6 months is entitled to a $3,500.00 moving allowance as provided under section 2 of 1965 PA 40, MCL 213.352, and that an individual who is a residential occupant may not be displaced until moving expenses or a moving allowance is paid as provided under 1965 PA 40, MCL 213.351 to 213.355, and the person has had a reasonable opportunity, not to exceed 180 days after the payment date of moving expenses or the moving allowance as provided under 1965 PA 40, MCL 213.351 to 213.355, to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling. If there is more than 1 owner of a parcel, the agency may make a single, unitary good faith written offer. The good faith offer shall state whether the agency reserves or waives its rights to bring federal or state cost recovery actions against the present owner of the property arising out of a release of hazardous substances at the property and the agency's appraisal of just compensation for the property shall reflect such reservation or waiver. The amount shall not be less than the agency's appraisal of just compensation for the property. If the owner fails to provide documents or information as required by subsection (2), the agency may base its good faith written offer on the information otherwise known to the agency whether or not the agency has sought a court order under subsection (2). The agency shall provide the owner of the property and the owner's attorney with an opportunity to review the written appraisal, if an appraisal has been prepared, or if an appraisal has not been prepared, the agency shall provide the owner or the owner's attorney with a written statement and summary, showing the basis for the amount the agency established as just compensation for the property. If an agency is unable to agree with the owner for the purchase of the property, after making a good faith written offer to purchase the property, the agency may file a complaint for the acquisition of the property in the circuit court in the county in which the property is located. If a parcel of property is situated in 2 or more counties and an owner resides in 1 of the counties, the complaint shall be filed in the county in which the owner is a resident. If a parcel of property is situated in 2 or more counties and an owner does not reside in 1 of the counties, the complaint may be filed in any of the counties in which the property is situated. The complaint shall ask that the court ascertain and determine just compensation to be made for the acquisition of the described property. As used in this subsection, \"comparable replacement dwelling\" means any dwelling that is all of the following:\n\n(a) Decent, safe, and sanitary.\n\n(b) Adequate in size to accommodate the occupants.\n\n(c) Within the financial means of the individual.\n\n(d) Functionally equivalent.\n\n(e) In an area not subject to unreasonable adverse environmental conditions.\n\n(f) In a location generally not less desirable than the location of the individual's dwelling with respect to public utilities, facilities, services, and the individual's place of employment.\n\n(2) During the period in which the agency is establishing just compensation for the owner's parcel, the agency has the right to secure tax returns, financial statements, and other relevant financial information for a period not to exceed 5 years before the agency's request. The owner shall produce the information within 21 business days after receipt of a written request from the agency. The agency shall reimburse the owner for actual, reasonable costs incurred in reproducing any requested documents, plus other actual, reasonable costs of not more than $1,000.00 incurred to produce the requested information. Within 45 days after production of the requested documents and other information, the owner shall provide to the agency a detailed invoice for the costs of reproduction and other costs sought. The owner is not entitled to a reimbursement of costs under this subsection if the reimbursement would be duplicative of any other reimbursement to the owner. If the owner fails to provide all documents and other information requested by the agency under this section, the agency may file a complaint and proposed order to show cause in the circuit court in the county specified in subsection (1). The court shall immediately hold a hearing on the agency's proposed order to show cause. The court shall order the owner to provide documents and other information requested by the agency that the court finds to be relevant to a determination of just compensation. An agency shall keep documents and other information that an owner provides to the agency under this section confidential. However, the agency and its experts and representatives may utilize the documents and other information to determine just compensation, may utilize the documents and other information in legal proceedings under this act, and may utilize the documents and other information as provided by court order. If the owner unreasonably fails to timely produce the documents and other information, the owner shall be responsible for all expenses incurred by the agency in obtaining the documents and other information. This section does not affect any right a party may otherwise have to discovery or to require the production of documents and other information upon commencement of an action under this act. A copy of this section shall be provided to the owner with the agency's request.\n\n(3) In determining just compensation, all of the following apply:\n\n(a) If an owner claims that the agency is taking property other than the property described in the good faith written offer or claims a right to compensation for damage caused by the taking, apart from the value of the property taken, and not described in the good faith written offer, the owner shall file a written claim with the agency stating the nature and substance of that property or damage. The owner's written claim shall provide sufficient information and detail to enable the agency to evaluate the validity of the claim and to determine its value. The owner shall file the claim within 90 days after the good faith written offer is made pursuant to section 5(1) or 180 days after the complaint is served, whichever is later, unless a later date is set by the court for reasonable cause. If the appraisal or written estimate of value is provided within the established period for filing written claims, the owner's appraisal or written estimate of value may serve as the written claim under this act. If the owner fails to timely file the written claim under this subsection, the claim is barred.\n\n(b) The parties shall exchange the agency's updated appraisal reports, if any, and the owner's appraisal report within 90 days after the expiration of the period for filing written claims, unless a later date is set by the court in accordance with section 11(1) for reasonable cause. If the agency believes that the information provided by the owner is not sufficient to allow the evaluation of the claim, the agency may request additional information from the owner and, if that information is not provided, may ask the court to compel the owner to provide additional information to enable the agency to evaluate the validity of the claim and to determine its value. If the owner fails to provide sufficient information after being ordered to do so by the court, the court may assess an appropriate sanction in accordance with the Michigan court rules for failing to comply with discovery orders, including, but not limited to, barring the claim. In addition, the court also shall consider any failure to provide timely information when it determines the maximum reimbursable attorney fees under section 16.\n\n(c) For any claim that has not fully accrued or is continuing in nature when the claim is filed, the owner shall provide information then reasonably available that would enable the agency to evaluate the claim, subject to the owner's continuing duty to supplement that information as it becomes available. The owner shall provide all supplementary information at least 90 days before trial, and the court shall afford the agency a reasonable opportunity for discovery once all supplementary information is provided and allow that discovery to proceed until 30 days before trial. For reasonable cause, the court may extend the time for the owner to provide information to the agency and for the agency to complete discovery. If the owner fails to provide supplementary information as required under this subdivision, the court may assess an appropriate sanction in accordance with the Michigan court rules for failing to comply with discovery orders, including, but not limited to, barring the claim. In addition, the court also shall consider any failure to provide timely supplemental information when it determines the maximum reimbursable attorney fees under section 16.\n\n(d) After receiving a written claim from an owner, the agency may provide written notice that it contests the compensability of the claim, establish an amount that it believes to be just compensation for the claim, or reject the claim. If the agency establishes an amount it believes to be just compensation for the claim, the agency shall submit a good faith written offer for the claim. The sum of the good faith written offer for all claims submitted under this subsection or otherwise disclosed in discovery for all items of property or damage plus the original good faith written offer constitutes the good faith written offer for purposes of determining the maximum reimbursable attorney fees under section 16.\n\n(e) If the owner files a claim that is frivolous or in bad faith, the agency is entitled to recover from the owner its actual and reasonable expenses incurred to evaluate the validity and to determine the value of the claim.\n\n(f) A residential tenant's leasehold interest of less than 6 months in the property is not a compensable claim under this act.\n\n(4) In addition to other allegations required or permitted by law, the complaint shall contain or have annexed to it all of the following:\n\n(a) A plan showing the property to be taken.\n\n(b) A statement of purpose for which the property is being acquired, and a request for other relief to which the agency is entitled by law.\n\n(c) The name of each known owner of the property being taken.\n\n(d) A statement setting forth the time within which motions for review under section 6 shall be filed; the amount that will be awarded and the persons to whom the amount will be paid in the event of a default; and the deposit and escrow arrangements made under subsection (5).\n\n(e) A declaration signed by an authorized official of the agency declaring that the property is being taken by the agency. The declaration shall be recorded with the register of deeds of each county within which the property is situated. The declaration shall include all of the following:\n\n(i) A description of the property to be acquired sufficient for its identification and the name of each known owner.\n\n(ii) A statement of the estate or interest in the property being taken. Fluid mineral and gas rights and rights of access to and over the highway are excluded from the rights acquired unless the rights are specifically included.\n\n(iii) A statement of the sum of money estimated by the agency to be just compensation for each parcel of property being acquired.\n\n(iv) Whether the agency reserves or waives its rights to bring federal or state cost recovery actions against the present owner of the property.\n\n(5) When the complaint is filed, the agency shall deposit the amount estimated to be just compensation with a bank, trust company, or title company in the business of handling real estate escrows, or with the state treasurer, municipal treasurer, or county treasurer. The deposit shall be set aside and held for the benefit of the owners, to be disbursed upon order of the court under section 8.\n\n(6) If the property being taken is a principal residence for which an exemption from certain local taxation is granted under section 7cc of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7cc, the agency is obligated to pay an additional amount to the owner or owners, which shall be deposited along with the amount estimated to be just compensation as provided in subsection (5). The additional amount shall be determined by subtracting the taxable value from the state equalized value, multiplying that amount by the total property tax millage rate applicable to the property taken, and multiplying that result by the number of years the owner or owners have owned the principal residence, but not more than 5 years.\n\n(7) As used in this section, \"taxable value\" means that value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.\n\nHistory:1980, Act 87, Imd.

      "text": "(1) Within the time prescribed to responsively plead after service of a complaint, an owner of the property desiring to challenge the necessity of acquisition of all or part of the property for the purposes stated in the complaint may file a motion in the pending action asking that the necessity be reviewed. The hearing shall be held within 30 days after the filing of the motion.\n\n(2) With respect to an acquisition by a public agency, the determination of public necessity by that agency is binding on the court in the absence of a showing of fraud, error of law, or abuse of discretion.\n\n(3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, with respect to an acquisition by a private agency, the court at the hearing shall determine the public necessity of the acquisition of the particular parcel. The granting of a permanent or temporary certificate by the public service commission or by a federal agency authorized by federal law to make determinations of public convenience and necessity as to condemnation constitutes a prima facie case that the project in furtherance of which the particular parcel would be acquired is required by the public convenience and necessity. The granting of a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the public service commission pursuant to the electric transmission line certification act, Act No. 30 of the Public Acts of 1995, being sections 460.561 to 460.575 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, is binding on the court.\n\n(4) The court shall render a decision within 60 days after the date on which the hearing is first scheduled.\n\n(5) The court's determination of a motion to review necessity is a final judgment.\n\n(6) Notwithstanding section 309 of the revised judicature act of 1961, Act No. 236 of the Public Acts of 1961, being section 600.309 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, an order of the court upholding or determining public necessity or upholding the validity of the condemnation proceeding is appealable to the court of appeals only by leave of that court pursuant to the general court rules. In the absence of a timely filed appeal of the order, an appeal shall not be granted and the order is not appealable as part of an appeal from a judgment as to just compensation.\n\n(7) If a motion to review necessity is not filed as provided in this section, necessity shall be conclusively presumed to exist and the right to have necessity reviewed or further considered is waived.\n\nHistory:1980, Act 87, Imd.

Upon the motion of any party, the court shall apportion the estimated compensation among the claimants to the compensation.\n\n(2) Except as provided in subsection (5), if the agency reserves its rights to bring a state or federal cost recovery claim against an owner, under circumstances that the court considers just, the court may allow any portion of the money deposited under section 5 to remain in escrow as security for remediation costs of environmental contamination on the condemned parcel. An agency shall present an affidavit and environmental report establishing that the funds placed on deposit under section 5 are likely to be required to remediate the property. The amount in escrow shall not exceed the likely costs of remediation if the property were used for its highest and best use. This subsection does not limit or expand an owner's or agency's rights to bring federal or state cost recovery claims.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any order entered by the court requiring money deposited pursuant to section 5 to remain in escrow for the payment of estimated remediation costs of contaminated property, the funds in escrow, plus interest subject to section 15, shall be released among the claimants to the just compensation under circumstances that the court considers just, including any of the following circumstances:\n\n(a) The court finds that the applicable statutory requirements for remediation have changed and the amount remaining in escrow is no longer required in full or in part to remediate the alleged environmental contamination.\n\n(b) The court finds that the anticipated need for the remediation of the alleged environmental contamination is not required or is not required to the extent of the funds remaining on deposit.\n\n(c) If the remediation of the property is not initiated by the agency within 2 years of surrender of possession pursuant to section 9 and the agency is unable to show good cause for delay.\n\n(d) The costs actually expended for remediation are less than the estimated costs of remediation or less than the amount of money remaining in escrow.\n\n(e) A court issues an order of apportionment of remediation responsibility.\n\n(4) If the court orders the agency to reverse its election under section 6a(1), the court shall order the escrowee to pay the amount of the revised good faith written offer for or on account of the just compensation that may be awarded pursuant to section 13, and to pay the balance of the escrow to the agency. If the agency seeks possession before the court decides whether to reverse the agency's election or before submitting a revised good faith offer, the agency may request that the court order a portion of the escrow withheld in anticipation of a reduction in the revised good faith offer, with the balance to be paid by the escrowee for or on account of the just compensation that may be awarded pursuant to section 13. If the court denies the request to reverse the agency's election or when the revised good faith offer is submitted, the court shall order the escrowee to pay any unpaid portion of it for or on account of the owner and to pay any balance to the agency.\n\n(5) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to money deposited under section 5 in escrow for the payment of just compensation for an owner's principal residence, if the principal residential structure is actually taken or the amount of the property taken leaves less property contiguous to the principal residential structure than the minimum lot size if the local governing unit has implemented a minimum lot size by zoning ordinance. This subsection does not limit or expand an owner's or agency's rights to bring federal or state cost recovery claims.

If the construction is not in substantial compliance, the owner is entitled to the difference between the value of the property as affected by the actual construction and the value of the property as it would have been, had construction been completed according to plan. The owner shall not recover more compensation than would have been payable if there was not a claim of enhancement benefits.\n\n(3) Upon demand of the owner before trial, the court may require the agency to acquire that portion of the remainder of the tract which the agency claims to be enhanced if the agency claims enhancement. This subsection shall not apply if the agency withdraws its claim of enhancement benefits before trial.\n\n(4) The agency has the burden of proof with respect to the existence of enhancement benefits.\n\nHistory:1980, Act 87, Imd.
