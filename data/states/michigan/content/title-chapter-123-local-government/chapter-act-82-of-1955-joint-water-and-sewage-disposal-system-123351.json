Such a contract shall contain those provisions which the parties thereto shall deem necessary to properly effect such sale and purchase and to define the rights and obligations of the parties. No such contract shall be entered into unless the disposal of the system or systems shall have been authorized by 3/5 of the electors of the metropolitan district voting thereon at a regular or special election and unless the acquirement of the system or systems shall have been authorized by 3/5 of the electors of the city voting thereon at a regular or special city election. Such an authorization shall be valid for the purpose of this act if made at an election held after the effective date of this act or within 1 year prior thereto. The foregoing requirements as to authorization by the electors shall supersede any charter requirements in that respect.\n\nHistory:1955, Act 82, Imd. Eff. May 26, 1955",
