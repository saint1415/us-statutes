      "text": "The owner or owners of any such area of land who desire such disconnection shall file a petition in the circuit court of the county where the land, or the greater part thereof, is situated, and in such petition shall allege facts in support of such disconnection. The particular city or village shall be made defendant, and it, or any taxpayer resident in such municipality, may appear and defend against such petition. If the court finds that the allegations of the petition are true and that the petitioner has met the qualifications as set forth in section 1 hereof, then such area of land shall be entitled to disconnection under the provisions of this act, and the court shall order said land disconnected from such city or village. In case of the disconnection from a city of any land which previously constituted a part of 1 or more townships, such land shall thereupon attach to and become a part of such township or townships, which shall be specified in the judgment. In case of the disconnection of any other land, the court shall determine and specify in the judgment what township or townships such land shall attach to and become a part of: Provided, however, That if by reason of city or village owned sewers, sidewalks, highways, water mains, gas mains, or other public improvements, upon or abutting said property, it would be inequitable to such city or village to grant said petition, in such case only may the court in its discretion deny the same even though petitioner has met the qualifications set forth in section 1 hereof.\n\nHistory:1949, Act 123, Eff.

The division of said indebtedness as between the municipalities involved shall be according to the provisions of Act No. 38 of the Public Acts of 1883, as amended, being sections 123.1 to 123.11, inclusive, of the Compiled Laws of 1948. Such disconnection shall not affect the lien upon any property for taxes for county, township, school, city or village purposes, or special assessments which have been levied thereon prior to such disconnection. Such disconnection shall not prevent the sale of any such land or parcels of land for delinquent taxes due to such county, township, school district, city or village at any regular state tax sale held in the manner provided by law, or at any regular tax sale of a city or village which, by its charter, has the right to sell lands for unpaid taxes or special assessments.\n\nHistory:1949, Act 123, Eff.
