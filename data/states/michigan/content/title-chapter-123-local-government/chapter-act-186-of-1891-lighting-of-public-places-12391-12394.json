Eff. July 2, 1891 ;-- CL 1897, 3437 ;-- CL 1915, 3426 ;-- CL 1929, 2411 ;-- CL 1948, 123.91Compiler's Notes:This act seems to have been intended to supercede Act 115 of 1891, on same subject. The only essential difference between the two acts is that this act provides for contracts for furnishing light as well as construction of works by municipality. In section 1, clause “or to contract for the furnishing thereof,” is inserted. In section 2, clause “or when such common council shall deem it expedient to contract for the lighting of such cities and villages, with electric or other lights,” is inserted, and all after first proviso added. In section 3, vote required of electors is made “a majority,” instead of “two-thirds,” and proviso added. The title of this act however, does not mention “inhabitants,” as does Act 115, 1891. But see MCL 123.101.",
