Fair market value shall be determined by evidence of sales of similar colonies within the 12 months immediately preceding the date of destruction of the colonies. The owner of the colony shall furnish an affidavit attesting to compensation received, if any, from any other source.\n\n(3) Indemnification pursuant to this section shall be subject to annual appropriations by the legislature and shall not be paid from department of agriculture funds designated for any other purpose. An agreement between the department of agriculture and an owner of the colonies shall contain a provision specifying that, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, indemnification is subject to appropriations by the legislature.\n\n(4) Acceptance of indemnification under this section operates as a release of the claim of the owner against the state but does not enlarge or diminish the owner's civil remedy against a person responsible for the owner's loss.\n\n(5) The department of agriculture shall not indemnify the owner of a colony acquired by the owner with knowledge that the colony is diseased or that it may have been exposed to a bee disease.\n\nHistory:Add. 1993, Act 108, Imd.
