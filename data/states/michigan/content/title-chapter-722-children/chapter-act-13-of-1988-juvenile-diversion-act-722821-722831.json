Information divulged by the minor during the conference or after the diversion is agreed to, but before a petition is filed with the court or has been authorized, must not be used against the minor.\n\n(3) If a conference held under this section results in diversion that imposes conditions on the minor and that will prevent the filing of a petition with the court or the authorization of a petition, the terms of the diversion agreement must be set forth in writing, dated, and signed by the law enforcement official or court intake worker, the minor, and the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian. The time period for a minor to complete the terms of a diversion agreement must not exceed 3 months, unless the law enforcement official or court intake worker determines that a longer period is needed for the minor to complete a specific treatment program and documents this determination as required under section 6. The diversion agreement must not include a term requiring the reimbursement of costs related to diversion services.\n\n(4) If a conference is held under this section and an agreement under subsection (3) is not reached, a petition may be filed with the court as provided by law and a petition may be authorized as provided by law. If an agreement under subsection (3) is not reached and a petition is to be filed, the petition must be filed with the court not later than 30 days after the conference.\n\n(5) If the minor fails to comply with the terms of the diversion agreement and the referral plan, the law enforcement official or the court intake worker may revoke the diversion agreement. If the diversion agreement is revoked, a petition may be filed with the court as provided by law and a petition may be authorized as provided by law.\n\nHistory:1988, Act 13, Eff.
