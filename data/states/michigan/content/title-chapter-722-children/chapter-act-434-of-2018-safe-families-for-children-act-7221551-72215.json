Both of the following apply concerning fingerprints submitted to the department of state police under this subdivision:\n\n(i) The department of state police shall store and retain all fingerprints submitted under this section in an automated fingerprint identification system database that searches against latent fingerprints and provides for an automatic notification when a subsequent fingerprint is submitted into the system that matches a set of fingerprints previously submitted under this section or when the criminal history of an individual whose fingerprints are retained in the system is updated. Upon receiving a notification under this subparagraph, the department of state police shall immediately notify the family service agency that requested the criminal history records check under this section. Information in the database maintained under this section is confidential, is not subject to disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246, and shall not be disclosed to any person except for purposes of this act or for law enforcement purposes.\n\n(ii) The department of state police shall forward all fingerprints submitted to it under this section to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to be retained in the FBI automatic notification system that provides for automatic notification if subsequent criminal history record information matches fingerprints previously submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation under this section. The fingerprints retained under this section may be searched by using future submissions to the FBI automatic notification system, including, but not limited to, latent fingerprint searches. This subparagraph does not apply until the department of state police is a participant in the FBI automatic notification system.\n\n(c) A family service agency requesting a criminal history records check under this section shall notify the department of state police within 5 days after the individual for which the criminal history records check was requested is no longer residing in a home where a minor child may be temporarily hosted or the individual's home is no longer hosting or available to host a minor child under this act.
