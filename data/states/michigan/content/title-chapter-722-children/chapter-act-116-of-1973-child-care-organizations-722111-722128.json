A completed application shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in processing of an application based on the fact that the application fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.\n\n(10) If, on a continual basis, inspections performed by a local health department delay the department in issuing or denying a license for a child care center, group child care home, or family child care home under this act within the 6-month period, the department may use department staff to complete the inspection instead of the local health department causing the delays.\n\n(11) The department shall assess fees as provided in the following schedule:\n\n(a) Family child care home license, $50.00 for an original license application and $25.00 for renewal.\n\n(b) Group child care home license, $100.00 for an original license application and $50.00 for renewal.\n\n(c) Child care center license with a capacity of 1 to 20, $150.00 for an original license application and $75.00 for renewal.\n\n(d) Child care center license with a capacity of 21 to 50, $200.00 for an original license application and $100.00 for renewal.\n\n(e) Child care center license with a capacity of 51 to 100, $250.00 for an original license application and $125.00 for renewal.\n\n(f) Child care center license with a capacity of over 100, $300.00 for an original license application and $150.00 for renewal.\n\n(12) The department shall use the fees collected under this section only to fund the program licensing child care centers, group child care homes, and family child care homes.

If a license is denied, revoked, or refused renewal, or an application is rejected as provided in section 15(4), the department shall not refund fees paid to the department.\n\n(14) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Completed application\" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, a state department or agency of another state, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state. A completed application does not include a health inspection performed by a local health department.\n\n(b) \"Conducive to the welfare of the children\" means:\n\n(i) The service and facility comply with this act and the administrative rules promulgated under this act.\n\n(ii) The disposition, temperament, condition, and action of the applicant, licensee, licensee designee, program director, child care staff member, and member of the household promote the safety and well-being of the children served.\n\nHistory:Add. 2017, Act 258, Eff.

A license shall not be revoked, a renewal of a license shall not be refused, or an application for a license shall not be denied, unless the licensee or applicant is given notice in writing of the grounds of the proposed revocation, denial, or refusal. If revocation, denial, or refusal is appealed within 30 days after receipt of the notice by writing addressed to the department director, the department director or his or her designee shall conduct a hearing at which the licensee or applicant may present testimony and confront witnesses. If the proposed revocation, refusal, or denial is not appealed, the license shall be revoked, the license shall be refused renewal, or the application shall be denied.

      "text": "(1) The legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n\n(a) When it is necessary for a child in this state to be placed with an adoptive or foster family, placing the child in a safe, loving, and supportive home is a paramount goal of this state.\n\n(b) As of September 9, 2015, there are 105 licensed adoption and foster care agencies in this state that are authorized to participate in and assist families with adoption and foster parent placements of children.\n\n(c) Having as many possible qualified adoption and foster parent agencies in this state is a substantial benefit to the children of this state who are in need of these placement services and to all of the citizens of this state because the more qualified agencies taking part in this process, the greater the likelihood that permanent child placement can be achieved.\n\n(d) As of September 9, 2015, the adoption and foster care licensees of this state represent a broad spectrum of organizations and groups, some of which are faith based and some of which are not faith based.\n\n(e) Private child placing agencies, including faith-based child placing agencies, have the right to free exercise of religion under both the state and federal constitutions. Under well-settled principles of constitutional law, this right includes the freedom to abstain from conduct that conflicts with an agency's sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\n(f) Faith-based and non-faith-based child placing agencies have a long and distinguished history of providing adoption and foster care services in this state.\n\n(g) Children and families benefit greatly from the adoption and foster care services provided by faith-based and non-faith-based child placing agencies. Ensuring that faith-based child placing agencies can continue to provide adoption and foster care services will benefit the children and families who receive publicly funded services.\n\n(h) Under well-established contracting practices of the department, a private child placing agency does not receive public funding with respect to a particular child or particular individuals referred by the department unless that agency affirmatively accepts the referral.\n\n(i) Under well-settled principles of constitutional law distinguishing \"private action\" from \"state action\", a private child placing agency does not engage in state action when the agency performs private-adoption or direct-placement services.

Before accepting a referral for services under a contract with the department, the child placing agency has the sole discretion to decide whether to engage in activities and perform services related to that referral. The department shall not control the child placing agency's decision whether to engage in those activities or perform those services. For purposes of this subsection, a child placing agency accepts a referral by doing either of the following:\n\n(a) Submitting to the department a written agreement to perform the services related to the particular child or particular individuals that the department referred to the child placing agency.\n\n(b) Engaging in any other activity that results in the department being obligated to pay the child placing agency for the services related to the particular child or particular individuals that the department referred to the child placing agency.\n\n(2) The state or a local unit of government shall not take an adverse action against a child placing agency on the basis that the child placing agency has decided to accept or not accept a referral under subsection (1).\n\n(3) If a child placing agency decides not to accept a referral under subsection (1), that occurrence shall not be a factor in determining whether a placement in connection with the referral is in the best interest of the child.\n\n(4) A child placing agency may assert a defense in an administrative or judicial proceeding based on this section.\n\n(5) For the purpose of this section, \"adverse action\" includes, but is not limited to, denying a child placing agency's application for funding, refusing to renew the child placing agency's funding, canceling the child placing agency's funding, declining to enter into a contract with the child placing agency, refusing to renew a contract with the child placing agency, canceling a contract with the child placing agency, declining to issue a license to the child placing agency, refusing to renew the child placing agency's license, canceling the child placing agency's license, taking an enforcement action against a child placing agency, discriminating against the child placing agency in regard to participation in a government program, and taking any action that materially alters the terms or conditions of the child placing agency's funding, contract, or license.\n\nHistory:Add. 2015, Act 53, Eff.
