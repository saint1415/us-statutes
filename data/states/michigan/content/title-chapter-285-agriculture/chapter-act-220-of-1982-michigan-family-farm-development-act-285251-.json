A mortgage lender is liable to the authority for damages suffered by the authority by reason of a false representation or the breach of a warranty by the mortgage lender and, in the event that a representation proves to be false or a breach of warranty, the mortgage lender shall, at the option of the authority, repurchase the mortgage or secured loan for the original purchase price adjusted for amounts subsequently paid on it, as the authority determines.\n\n(5) The authority shall require the recording with the appropriate register of deeds of any assignment of a mortgage loan purchased by it from a mortgage lender and is not required to notify the mortgagor of its purchase of the mortgage loan. The authority is not required to inspect or take possession of the mortgage documents if the mortgage lender from which the mortgage loan is purchased enters into a contract to service the mortgage loan and account to the authority for the mortgage loan.\n\nHistory:1982, Act 220, Imd.
