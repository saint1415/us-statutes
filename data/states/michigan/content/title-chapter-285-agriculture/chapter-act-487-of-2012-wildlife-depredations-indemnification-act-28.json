Indemnification for missing animals shall only be paid if there is a history of losses to the owner of livestock as evidenced by a prior payment by the department due to the death or injury of livestock from wolves.\n\n(2) To be eligible for indemnification under subsection (1), the owner of livestock shall do all of the following:\n\n(a) Report the incident to the department within 24 hours after the animal is discovered to be dead, injured, or missing.\n\n(b) File a claim for indemnification with the department verifying the type and number of animals for which indemnification is sought. The verification may include photographs of the animals or tracks or other information that provides support for the claim. If the claim seeks indemnification for missing animals, a notarized statement from the owner specifying the date of birth of each missing animal and the date on which the animals were discovered missing, along with evidence of prior indemnification payments due to death or injury of livestock from wolves, is sufficient documentation that 1 or more animals are missing and eligible for indemnification.\n\n(c) Upon request, provide the department of natural resources with access to the owner's property as necessary to conduct an investigation if the department of natural resources believes that an on-site visit will assist its investigation.\n\n(d) Upon request, provide the department with documentation that the animals have official identification, if required under the animal industry act, 1988 PA 466, MCL 287.701 to 287.746.\n\nHistory:2012, Act 487, Imd.

If the department fails to make the indemnification payment within this 45-day time period, the person is entitled to receive from the department twice the amount of the original claim.\n\n(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the department shall reimburse the claimant, for each animal included in the claim, 100% of the fair market value, on the date of the appraisal, of livestock of that type marketable for the purpose for which the animal was intended to be marketed, not to exceed $4,000.00 for each animal. The appraisal determination shall not delay the slaughter, destruction, or disposition of the livestock animals.\n\n(3) The department shall deduct from the indemnification amount under subsection (2) for any compensation received, or to be received by the owner, from any other source, including, but not limited to, indemnification by the United States department of agriculture, insurance, or salvage value. The owner shall furnish to the department all records indicating other sources of indemnity. An affidavit signed by the owner attesting to the amount of compensation for the livestock received, or to be received, from any other source shall accompany the appraisal certificate prior to the payment of indemnification under this section.\n\n(4) The department may make an indemnification payment pursuant to this section not to exceed $100,000.00 per incident which is the basis for a valid claim for indemnification under this act, from any line item in the annual budget for the department in the applicable fiscal year. Any agreement for an indemnification payment greater than $100,000.00 entered into between the department and an owner of livestock shall contain a provision indicating that, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, indemnification shall be subject to specific appropriations by the legislature and not be paid from department funds.\n\nHistory:2012, Act 487, Imd.
