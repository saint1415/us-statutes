      "text": "WHEREAS, Section 1 of Article V of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the Governor;\n\nWHEREAS, Section 2 of Article V of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the Governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that the Governor considers necessary for efficient administration;\n\nWHEREAS, Section 3 of Article VIII of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests leadership and general supervision over all public education, including adult education and instructional programs in state institutions, except as to institutions of higher education granting baccalaureate degrees, in an elected State Board of Education;\n\nWHEREAS, 1999 PA 10 removed the elected school board for the Detroit Public School District and replaced the board with an appointed board consisting of six appointees and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction;\n\nWHEREAS, 1999 PA 10 also created within the Department of Education a School District Accountability Board consisting of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Treasurer, the State Budget Director, and two persons appointed by Governor John M. Engler to review district improvement plans submitted by the appointed school board and monitor any progress being made in achieving goals and benchmarks under the plan;\n\nWHEREAS, under 1999 PA 10, the powers of the School District Accountability Board were limited to a qualifying school district in which an appointed school reform board is in place, such as the board appointed for the Detroit Public School District in 1999;\n\nWHEREAS, the takeover of the Detroit Public School District by an appointed board mandated under 1999 PA 10 was a failure, resulting in a $198 million deficit during Fiscal Year 2005;\n\nWHEREAS, 2003 PA 303 amended 1990 PA 10 to end the state takeover of the Detroit Public School District, allowing Detroit voters, rather than Lansing lawmakers, to determine the powers of the Detroit School Board and what is best for their schools and their children;\n\nWHEREAS, when given a choice, Detroit voters chose to govern their school district by an elected board in the same manner as other districts throughout this state, and the elected board they selected is now in place;\n\nWHEREAS, return to an elected school board for Detroit Public Schools eliminates the need for a special School District Accountability Board to provide state oversight of an appointed board for the Detroit Public School District;\n\nWHEREAS, the functions of the School District Accountability Board are best vested in elected officials directly accountable to the public;\n\nWHEREAS, it is necessary in the interests of efficient administration and effectiveness of government to change the organization of the executive branch of state government;\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Jennifer M.
