      "text": "Every Michigander deserves a path to prosperity. They deserve to explore, learn, grow, and develop the skills they need to thrive. That's why I am focused on building a bright future for Michigan by making strategic decisions and investments now for the long-term.\n\nFor too long, Michigan has fallen behind other states and countries when it comes to student achievement and attainment, impacting the state's workforce and economic growth. We know that today, more than ever, building a skilled workforce is not a matter of a single certificate, course, or credential. It's a generational project that will require a shared vision, effective decision-making, and strategic resource allocation to ensure that each and every person has the best opportunity to thrive.\n\nIn other words—we must support lifelong education, achievement, and potential. Consolidating various programs from across state government into a single department will enhance our ability to create a path to prosperity for every Michigander and support the long-term economic health of our state with a coordinated strategy.\n\nEstablishing the Michigan Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential, or MiLEAP, ensures all available resources, data, and dollars are aligned around a single vision—building an education system from preschool through postsecondary that can support our kids, families, and the economy of the future by ensuring anyone can make it in Michigan. MiLEAP will achieve this goal by establishing clear metrics, collaborating with cross-sector leaders at the local, regional, and state level, and developing a shared action plan for everyone to work toward.\n\nThe new department will partner with the Department of Education and the State Board of Education, complementing their existing long-term planning efforts. MiLEAP will also work with the recently launched Growing· Michigan Together Council as it looks at ways to strengthen preschool to postsecondary learning while growing the state's economy and population.\n\nWith bold goals, a united vision, a shared action plan, the capacity to deliver, and clear metrics, MiLEAP can build a brighter future for Michigan from preschool to postsecondary to paycheck.\n\nSection 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the governor.\n\nSection 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that the governor considers necessary for efficient administration.\n\nActing pursuant to the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:\n\n1. Creation of the Michigan Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential\n\n(a) The Michigan Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential (\"MiLEAP\") is created as a principal department within the executive branch.

It is also charged with building partnerships beyond the classroom to improve student learning and coordinating among state departments and agencies to achieve the best outcomes for Michiganders.\n\n(b) MiLEAP will be led by a Director (\"Director\"), who will be appointed by the Governor. The Director will be a member of the Governor's cabinet.\n\n(c) Office of Early Childhood Education\n\n(1) The Office of Early Childhood Education is created within MiLEAP.

The Office will collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education to coordinate services and supports for young children and families.\n\n(d) Office of Higher Education\n\n(1) The Office of Higher Education is created within MiLEAP.

In collaboration with elected and appointed governing boards of higher education, the boards of public community and junior colleges, the boards of private not-for-profit colleges and universities, statewide postsecondary education associations, and other key stakeholders, the Office of Higher Education will work to increase college enrollment, graduation, and attainment rates to put more Michiganders on a path to prosperity. The Office of Higher Education will collaborate with the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, the Department of Treasury, and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to coordinate services and supports for workforce development.\n\n(e) Office of Education Partnerships\n\n(1) The Office of Education Partnerships is created within MiLEAP. The Office of Education Partnerships will lead statewide efforts to build and sustain partnerships that enhance educational opportunities and outcomes throughout the state from preschool through postsecondary education.

The Office will expand access to programs that extend learning beyond the classroom, including before school, after school, summer programming, and employer-partnerships.
