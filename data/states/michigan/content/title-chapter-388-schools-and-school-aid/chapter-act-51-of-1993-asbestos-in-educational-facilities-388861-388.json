      "text": "As used in this act:\n\n(a) \"Asbestos\" means a group of naturally occurring minerals that separate into fibers, including chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite, asbestiform anthophyllite, asbestiform tremolite, and asbestiform actinolite.\n\n(b) \"Asbestos-containing material\" means any material or product containing more than 1% asbestos.\n\n(c) \"Cost\" means the discounted present value of all anticipated future expenditures associated with a course of action in an area where asbestos removal is being considered.\n\n(d) \"Educational facility\" means a building owned, leased, or under the control of a public or nonpublic school or school system containing any of grades K-12.\n\n(e) \"Friable\", when referring to asbestos-containing material, means material that can, by hand pressure, be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder when dry.\n\n(f) \"Operations and maintenance plan\" means a program of work practices designed to maintain asbestos or friable asbestos-containing material in good condition to ensure the cleanup of asbestos or friable asbestos-containing material previously released and to prevent the further release of asbestos or asbestos-containing material by minimizing and controlling the damage or disturbance of asbestos or asbestos-containing material.\n\n(g) \"Removal\" means the taking out or stripping of asbestos or asbestos-containing material from an existing structure.\n\nHistory:1993, Act 51, Imd.
