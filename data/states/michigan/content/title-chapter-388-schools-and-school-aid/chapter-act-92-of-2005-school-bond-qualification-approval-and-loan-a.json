Based on changes of circumstances, including, but not limited to, additional bond qualification, refundings, changes in qualified loan interest rates, changes in taxable values, and assumptions contained in any then currently effective guidelines issued by the state treasurer pursuant to section 5(2)(c), the school district shall not less than annually, beginning on October 1, 2013, using methods prescribed in this act, recalculate the computed millage necessary to generate sufficient annual levy proceeds to pay principal and interest on all of the school district's qualified bonds and principal and interest on all qualified loans related to those qualified bonds not later than the final mandatory repayment date. If the school district determines that the recalculated computed millage is lower than its current millage levy rate, the school district shall promptly notify the state treasurer in writing of the recalculated computed millage. Immediately thereafter, the school district shall decrease its millage levy rate to the recalculated computed millage, but not below the computed millage established pursuant to the most recent order qualifying bonds, other than an order qualifying refunding bonds, for that school district, or to the minimum levy prescribed by law for receipt of qualified loans, whichever rate is higher. If the school district determines that the recalculated computed millage is higher than its current millage levy rate, the school district shall promptly notify the state treasurer in writing of the recalculated computed millage. Immediately thereafter, the school district shall increase its millage levy rate to the recalculated computed millage, subject to 1 of the following exceptions, and subject to any maximum millage levy rate otherwise prescribed for by law:\n\n(i) For each school district's first recalculated computed millage required as of October 1, 2013, increase its millage levy by a percentage amount equal to the equivalent percentage of taxable value change for that school district over the immediately preceding 5 years, but not higher than the recalculated computed millage.\n\n(ii) For each school district's subsequent recalculated computed millage beginning October 1, 2014 and each year thereafter, increase its millage levy by a percentage amount equal to the percentage of taxable value decline for the immediately preceding year ending September 30, but not to a rate higher than the recalculated computed millage.\n\n(iii) If it is determined that a district's current computed millage is sufficient to pay all qualified loans by the mandatory final loan repayment date, no recalculation of the computed millage is required.\n\n(b) \"Final mandatory repayment date\" means the final mandatory repayment date determined by the state treasurer under section 9.\n\n(c) \"Michigan finance authority\" means the Michigan finance authority created under Executive Reorganization Order No. 2010-2, MCL 12.194.\n\n(d) \"Qualified bond\" means a bond that is qualified under this act for state loans as provided in section 16 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.

A qualified bond may include a bond issued to refund loans owed to the state under this act.\n\n(e) \"Qualified loan\" means a loan made under this act or former 1961 PA 108 from this state to a school district to pay debt service on a qualified bond.\n\n(f) \"Revolving loan fund\" means the school loan revolving fund created under section 16c of the shared credit rating act, 1985 PA 227, MCL 141.1066c.\n\n(g) \"School district\" means a general powers school district organized under the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1852, or a school district of the first class as described in the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1852, having the power to levy ad valorem property taxes.\n\n(h) \"State treasurer\" means the state treasurer or his or her duly authorized designee.\n\n(i) \"Taxable value\" means the value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.\n\nHistory:2005, Act 92, Imd.
