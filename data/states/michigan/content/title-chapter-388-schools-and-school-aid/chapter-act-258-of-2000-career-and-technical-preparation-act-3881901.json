If applicable, the school district shall then forward to the eligible student any refunded money in excess of the amount paid by the school district for the course on behalf of the student.\n\n(b) The eligible student shall repay to the school district any funds that were expended by the school district for the course that are not refunded to the school district by the career and technical preparation program.

If applicable, the career and technical preparation program shall then refund to the eligible student any funds that are refundable due to noncompletion of the course and are in excess of the amount paid by the department of treasury for the course on behalf of the eligible student.\n\n(b) The eligible student shall repay to the department of treasury any funds that were expended by the department of treasury for the course that are not refunded to the department of treasury by the career and technical preparation program. This subdivision does not apply to an eligible student who does not complete the course due to a family or medical emergency, as determined by the career and technical preparation program.\n\n(11) A school district, state approved nonpublic school, the department, or the department of treasury shall make available to an eligible student copies of all correspondence in the possession of the school district, state approved nonpublic school, department, or department of treasury regarding the eligible student's participation in a career and technical preparation course under this act. The school district, state approved nonpublic school, department, or department of treasury shall keep correspondence described in this subsection for at least 1 year.\n\n(12) If a school district pays for books for an eligible student for a career and technical preparation course under this section, the books are the property of the school district and must be turned over to the school district after the eligible student completes the course.\n\n(13) This section does not apply to any career and technical preparation courses in which an eligible student is enrolled in addition to being enrolled full-time in that eligible student's school district or state approved nonpublic school; to a career and technical preparation course an eligible student is retaking after failing to achieve a satisfactory grade; or to a course contrary to the eligibility provisions of this act.

In determining full-time enrollment in a state approved nonpublic school under this section for a student enrolled in a career and technical preparation program under this act, the student's enrollment in both the state approved nonpublic school and the career and technical preparation program must be counted as enrollment in the state approved nonpublic school and a student is not considered to be enrolled in a state approved nonpublic school less than full-time solely because of the effect of the student's enrollment in 1 or more career and technical preparation courses under this act, including necessary travel time, on the number of class hours provided by the state approved nonpublic school to the student.\n\n(14) This act does not require a school district or the department of treasury to pay or otherwise provide financial support for transportation or parking costs necessary for an eligible student to participate in a career and technical preparation program under this act. A school district, state approved nonpublic school, or this state is not liable for any injury incurred by an eligible student that is related to transportation necessary for the eligible student to participate in a career and technical preparation program under this act.\n\n(15) The legislature shall appropriate funds to the department of treasury for making payments required to be made by the department of treasury under this act.\n\n(16) By September 1, 2020, the department shall publish guidelines regarding how to determine the prorated percentage of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance under subsections (5) and (6).

The amount of high school credit granted by a school district for a course completed under this act shall be determined by the school district.\n\n(6) The high school credits granted to an eligible student under this act shall be counted toward the graduation requirements and subject area requirements of the school district.
