      "text": "WHEREAS, Article V, Section 2 of the Constitution of the state of Michigan of 1963 empowers the Governor to make changes in the organization of the Executive Branch or in the assignment of functions among its units which he considers necessary for efficient administration; and\n\nWHEREAS, Executive Order No. 1999-12 transferred the day-to-day administrative powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities under the Perkins Act to the Department of Career Development; and\n\nWHEREAS, the purpose of the Carl D.

Convening and meeting at such times as the Board determines necessary to carry out the Board's responsibilities under Perkins, but not less than four times annually; and\n\n4.
