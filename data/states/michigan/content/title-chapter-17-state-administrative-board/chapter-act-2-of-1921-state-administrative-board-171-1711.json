Dec. 20, 2019 ;-- Am. 2021, Act 143, Imd. Eff. Dec. 27, 2021Constitutionality:Individual members of the legislature brought an action challenging the State Administrative Board's authority under MCL 17.3 to transfer appropriated funds from one program to another within a department. The Court of Appeals conferred standing and held that the statutory authority relied upon by the board had been impliedly repealed by subsequent legislative acts. The Michigan Supreme Court agreed that the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee had standing, but reversed the Court of Appeals decision repealing the State Administrative Board's authority to transfer funds. The Michigan Supreme Court held that neither subsequent amendments to the State Administrative Board Act nor the enactment of the Management and Budget Act indicates an intent by the legislature to repeal by implication the Board's authority under MCL 17.3 to transfer funds within a department.
