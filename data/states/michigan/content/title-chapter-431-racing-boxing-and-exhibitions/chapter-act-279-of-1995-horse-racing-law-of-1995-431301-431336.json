The racing commissioner shall not issue an occupational license to a person who, within the 6 years immediately preceding the date of the person's application for the occupational license, was convicted of a felony involving theft, dishonesty, misrepresentation, fraud, corruption, drug possession, delivery, or use, or other criminal misconduct that is related to the person's ability to and the likelihood that the person will perform the functions and duties of the racing related occupation for which the person seeks to be licensed and participate in pari-mutuel horse racing in that licensed occupation in a fair, honest, open, and lawful manner. The racing commissioner shall not issue a pari-mutuel occupational license to a person who, within 2 years immediately preceding the date of the person's application for the occupational license, was convicted of a misdemeanor involving theft, dishonesty, misrepresentation, fraud, corruption, drug possession, delivery, or use, or other criminal misconduct that is related to the person's ability to and the likelihood that the person will perform the functions and duties of the racing related occupation for which the person seeks to be licensed and participate in pari-mutuel horse racing in that licensed occupation in a fair, honest, open, and lawful manner.\n\n(2) A veterinarian is not required to be licensed under this act to provide necessary and appropriate emergency veterinary care or treatment to any horse that is intended to be entered, is entered, or participates in a race with wagering by pari-mutuel methods or a nonbetting race or workout conducted at a licensed race meeting in this state. For purposes of this section, \"emergency veterinary care or treatment\" means care or treatment necessary and appropriate to save the life of a horse or prevent permanent physical injury or damage to a horse in a situation requiring immediate veterinary action. Only veterinarians licensed under this act may provide nonemergency veterinary care or treatment to a horse in this state that is intended to be entered, is entered, or participates in races at licensed race meetings in this state. Only persons licensed under this act or otherwise authorized by the racing commissioner may enter the restricted grounds of a licensed race meeting where horses are kept that are eligible to race at the race meeting. For the purposes of this section and sections 30 and 31, a horse that is intended to be entered is a horse that has its name put into the draw for a specific race, and a horse that is entered in a race is a horse that has been drawn into a specific race.\n\n(3) As conditions precedent to being issued and holding a valid pari-mutuel occupational license, a license applicant shall disclose, in writing, any ownership interest that the applicant has in a racehorse and provide any other information the racing commissioner considers necessary and proper and proof of compliance with the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, except that the proof of compliance requirement does not apply to horse owners and trainers not covered under section 115 of the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.115.\n\n(4) In addition to the requirements of subsection (3), an applicant for a pari-mutuel occupational license shall consent, upon application and for the duration of the occupational license, if issued, to all of the following:\n\n(a) Personal inspections, inspections of the applicant's personal property, and inspections of premises and property related to his or her participation in a race meeting by persons authorized by the racing commissioner.\n\n(b) If the applicant is applying for a racing official, jockey, driver, trainer, or groom license, or for any other license for an occupation that involves contact with or access to the racehorses or the barn areas or stables where racehorses are kept, a breathalyzer test, urine test, or other noninvasive fluid test to detect the presence of alcohol or a controlled substance, if directed to do so by the racing commissioner or his or her representative. If the results of a test show that an occupational licensee has more than .05% of alcohol in his or her blood, or has present in his or her body a controlled substance, the person shall not be permitted to continue in his or her duties or participate in horse racing until he or she can produce, at his or her own expense, a negative test result. The licensee may be penalized by the racing commissioner for his or her positive test results, which may include any disciplinary action authorized by this act or rules promulgated under this act. This subsection does not apply to a controlled substance obtained directly from, or pursuant to a valid prescription from, a licensed health care provider, except that the racing commissioner may consider the person's medical need for prescribed controlled substances in determining the person's fitness to be licensed to participate in pari-mutuel horse racing. The racing commissioner shall suspend for not less than 1 year the license of a person who for the third time in a period of not more than 6 consecutive years is relieved of his or her duties because of this subsection.\n\n(5) When applying for an occupational license, an applicant shall provide the racing commissioner with 1 or more sets of his or her fingerprints and the appropriate fees as requested by the racing commissioner. The racing commissioner shall send the applicant's fingerprints and the appropriate fees to either the department of state police or the federal bureau of investigation in a manner acceptable to the federal bureau of investigation. If the fingerprints and fees are sent to the department of state police, the department of state police shall forward the fingerprints and the fees to the federal bureau of investigation for a criminal history check. Information obtained under this subsection shall only be used to determine the character and fitness of the applicant for licensing purposes.\n\n(6) A person who is issued a pari-mutuel occupational license as a trainer is responsible for and absolute insurer of the condition, fitness, eligibility, and qualification of the horses entered to race for the person by whom the trainer is employed, except as prescribed by the rules promulgated by the racing commissioner under this act. This subsection shall not be construed or interpreted to determine civil tort liability of any racehorse owner or trainer but shall be for purposes of enforcement of this act only. A trainer shall not start a horse that has in its body a drug or foreign substance unless permitted pursuant to section 30 and the rules promulgated under that section. A trainer is strictly liable and subject to disciplinary action if a horse under the trainer's actual or apparent care and control as trainer has a drug or foreign substance in its body, in violation of section 30 and the rules promulgated under that section.\n\n(7) Upon the filing of a written complaint, under oath, in the office of the racing commissioner, or upon the written motion of the racing commissioner regarding the actions or omissions of a person issued a pari-mutuel occupational license, the racing commissioner may summarily suspend the occupational license of the person for a period of not more than 90 days pending a hearing and final determination by the racing commissioner regarding the acts or omissions complained of in the written complaint or motion, if the commissioner determines from the complaint or motion that the public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency action. The racing commissioner shall schedule the complaint or motion to be heard within 14 business days after the occupational license is summarily suspended and notify the holder of the occupational license of the date, time, and place of the hearing not less than 5 days before the date of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the contested case provisions of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. The action of the racing commissioner in revoking or suspending a pari-mutuel occupational license may be appealed to the circuit court pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. If the racing commissioner's order is predicated upon a series of acts, the review by the circuit court may be in the county in which any of the alleged acts or failures to act took place.\n\n(8) A decision by the racing commissioner or a deputy commissioner or state steward of racing to deny an application for an occupational license may be appealed to the circuit court and reviewed pursuant to section 631 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.631. A suspension or revocation of an occupational license may be appealed and reviewed pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.\n\n(9) Each pari-mutuel occupational licensee shall pay a license fee of not less than $10.00 or more than $100.00 as determined by the racing commissioner.\n\nHistory:1995, Act 279, Imd.

The race meeting licensee is responsible for all conduct of its third-party facilitators. All wagers must be placed by persons within this state and may be placed only in person at a licensed race meeting or electronically through a licensed third-party facilitator. A race meeting licensee or licensed third-party facilitator shall not solicit, offer, accept, or process wagers on or in connection with other gaming or gambling products, including, but not limited to, slot machines and casino table games.\n\n(9) A person that does not hold a race meeting license or a third-party facilitator license that solicits or accepts wagers on the results of live or simulcast horse races from individuals in this state is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years or a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both. Each act of solicitation or wager that is accepted in violation of this section is a separate offense.\n\n(10) Only a race meeting licensee or its contracted licensed third-party facilitator may process, accept, offer, or solicit wagers on the results of live or simulcast horse races as determined and approved by the racing commissioner.\n\n(11) As used in this section, \"act or transaction relative to pari-mutuel wagering on the results of live or simulcast horse races\" means those steps taken by a race meeting licensee to accept a wager and process it within the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with this act.\n\nHistory:1995, Act 279, Imd.

      "text": "(1) Simulcasting by race meeting licensees may be authorized by the racing commissioner subject to the limitations of this section. Except as specifically provided in section 12, a race meeting licensee shall not conduct simulcast wagering unless the race meeting licensee conducts 30 or more live racing days in that calendar year.\n\n(2) The holder of a race meeting license may apply to the racing commissioner, in the manner and form required by the commissioner, for a permit to televise simulcasts of horse races to viewing areas within the enclosure of the licensed racetrack at which the applicant is licensed to conduct its race meeting. The commissioner may issue a permit for individual race and full card simulcasts televised during, between, before, or after programmed live horse races on any day that live racing is conducted by the applicant, and also on other days during the term of the applicant's license when the applicant does not conduct live horse racing, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(a) The applicant must have a current contract with a certified horsemen's organization.\n\n(b) The applicant must have applied for the minimum number of live racing dates required by section 12(1) or (2), subject to the availability of adequate horse supply as determined by the racing commissioner.\n\n(c) The applicant must make a continuing good faith effort throughout the duration of its race meeting to program and conduct not fewer than 8 live horse races on each live racing date allocated to the applicant.\n\n(d) The certified horsemen's organization with which the applicant has contracted must have consented to the requested simulcasts on any live racing day when the applicant is unable to program and conduct not fewer than 8 live horse races, if required by section 12(3).\n\n(e) If the requested simulcasts are interstate, the applicant must waive in writing any right that the applicant may have under the interstate horse racing act of 1978, 15 USC 3001 to 3007, to restrict interstate simulcasts by other race meeting licensees in this state.\n\n(f) The applicant must make the video and audio signals of its live horse races available for intertrack simulcasting to all licensed race meetings in this state located more than 12 miles from the applicant's race meeting. The applicant must charge each race meeting licensee the same fee to receive its live signals for intertrack simulcasting.\n\n(g) Except as otherwise agreed by the other race meeting licensees and the respective certified horsemen's organizations with which they contract, the applicant must receive all available intertrack simulcasts from licensed race meetings located more than 12 miles from the applicant's race meeting.\n\n(h) The applicant must not conduct interstate simulcasts unless it also receives all intertrack simulcasts from other licensed race meetings that are available.\n\n(i) All authorized simulcasts must be conducted in compliance with the written permit and related orders issued by the racing commissioner and all other requirements and conditions of this act and the rules of the racing commissioner promulgated under this act.\n\n(j) All authorized interstate simulcasts must also comply with the interstate horse racing act of 1978, 15 USC 3001 to 3007.\n\n(3) All forms of wagering by pari-mutuel methods provided for under this act for live racing shall be allowed on simulcast horse races authorized under this section. All money wagered on simulcast horse races at a licensed race meeting must be included in computing the total amount of all money wagered at the licensed race meeting for purposes of section 17. If the simulcast is an interstate simulcast, the money wagered on the simulcast must form a separate pari-mutuel pool at the receiving track unless 2 or more licensees receive the same interstate simulcast signals or the racing commissioner permits the receiving track to combine its interstate simulcast pool with the pool created at the out-of-state sending track on the same race. If 2 or more licensees receive the same interstate simulcast signals, the money wagered on the simulcasts must be combined in a common pool and the licensees shall jointly agree and designate at which race meeting the common pool will be located. However, if the law of the jurisdiction in which the sending racetrack is located permits interstate common pools at the sending racetrack, the racing commissioner may permit pari-mutuel pools on interstate simulcast races in this state to be combined with pari-mutuel pools on the same races created at the out-of-state sending racetrack. If the pari-mutuel pools on the interstate simulcast races in this state are combined in a common pool at the out-of-state sending track, then the commissions described in section 17 on the pool created in this state must be adjusted to equal the commissions in effect at the sending track under the laws of its jurisdiction. If the simulcast is an intertrack simulcast, the money wagered on the simulcast at the receiving racetrack must be added to the pari-mutuel pool at the sending racetrack.\n\n(4) A race meeting licensee licensed to conduct pari-mutuel horse racing shall provide the necessary equipment to send intertrack simulcasts of the live horse races conducted at its race meeting to all other race meeting licensees in this state, and shall send its intertrack simulcast signals to those licensees upon request for an agreed fee, which shall not exceed 3% of the total amount wagered on the race at the receiving track.\n\n(5) The racing commissioner may authorize a race meeting licensee to transmit simulcasts of live horse races conducted at its racetrack to locations outside of this state in accordance with the interstate horse racing act of 1978, 15 USC 3001 to 3007, or any other applicable laws, and may permit pari-mutuel pools on such simulcast races created under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the receiving track is located to be combined in a common pool with pari-mutuel pools on the same races created in this state. A race meeting licensee that transmits simulcasts of its races to locations outside this state shall pay 50% of the fee that it receives for sending the simulcast signal to the horsemen's purse pool at the sending track after first deducting the actual verified cost of sending the signal out of state.\n\n(6) Unless otherwise approved by the racing commissioner, a race meeting licensee shall not receive and offer wagers on an interstate simulcast unless the interstate simulcast is available to all race meeting licensees in this state at the same rate.\n\n(7) Simulcasting of events other than horse races for purposes of pari-mutuel wagering is prohibited.\n\n(8) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Interstate simulcast\" means a live simulcast from a racetrack outside of this state to a racetrack inside this state.\n\n(b) \"Intertrack simulcast\" means a live simulcast from 1 racetrack in this state to another racetrack in this state.\n\n(c) \"Simulcast\" means the live transmission of video and audio signals conveying a horse race held either inside or outside of this state to a licensed race meeting in this state.\n\nHistory:1995, Act 279, Imd.
