      "text": "(1) For a marriage entered into in this state before the effective date of the amendatory act that added subsection (2), the legal marriage of a minor releases that minor from parental control. The husband or wife of a minor, so released, is entitled to the same rights, benefits, and privileges, and the minor is subject to the same duties, liabilities, and responsibilities, as the husband or wife, as if the minor husband or wife were of legal age at the time of the marriage.\n\n(2) It is unnecessary in any divorce action commenced by or against a legally married minor to have a next friend or guardian ad litem appointed for that minor unless the judge requires it. A minor is entitled to prosecute or defend the action in the same manner and with the same effect as if he or she were of legal age.\n\nHistory:1919, Act 160, Eff.
