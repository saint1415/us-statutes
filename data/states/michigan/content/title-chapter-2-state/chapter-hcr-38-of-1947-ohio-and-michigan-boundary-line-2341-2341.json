      "text": "Whereas, In the 1945 regular session of the legislature of Michigan adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 15 relative to the boundary line between the two states of Ohio and Michigan in Lake Erie; and\n\nWhereas, Said concurrent resolution was presented to the legislature as a part of a proposal to determine the area of the entire state by inclusion of water areas within the total and without any other significance; and\n\nWhereas, Upon subsequent investigation it became apparent that an area of about 70 square miles in Lake Erie was involved in the matter then presented and some question as to the jurisdiction over said water existed between the state of Ohio and the state of Michigan; and\n\nWhereas, The particular area in question became a matter of dispute because of early surveys and maps purporting to determine the boundary line between the states in Lake Erie and showing for a great many years that the said boundary ran from a terminus in Lake Erie from a non-existent boundary marker, which was formerly Grassy Point, to a turning point in the international boundary line between the United States and Canada, said line being at an angle more acute than 45 degrees; and\n\nWhereas, The state of Ohio, by a concurrent resolution adopted several years ago attempted to resolve the stated uncertainty concerning the boundary line by adopting a point on Turtle Island in Lake Erie as a basis for a line at 45° to intersect the land boundary line between the states and to intersect the International boundary line thereby conforming more closely to the language of the original and enabling acts and the constitutional provisions regarding the boundary line between the two states; and\n\nWhereas, It is apparent that for many years the state of Michigan has exercised jurisdiction over the area in question and may have established by adverse possession and by consent and acquiescence of the state of Ohio a good title thereto; and\n\nWhereas, Since the action of the two legislatures by concurrent resolution is not sufficient in the law governing the relationship of States to convey title or change boundary lines, no settlement of any such dispute can be reached by such method; and\n\nWhereas, If a settlement is to be reached it will, of necessity, require statutory enactment by the two states and should be the subject matter of an investigation by a joint boundary commission; now therefore be it\n\nResolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That the State of Michigan nor any rights of said state concerning the boundary line in Lake Erie between the state of Ohio and the state of Michigan were not affected by the adoption of Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 15 of the 1945 session of the Michigan legislature; and be it further\n\nResolved, That insofar as said concurrent resolution No. 15 may in any manner be interpreted as determinative of the position of the state of Michigan with regard to the said boundary in Lake Erie, said concurrent resolution is hereby rescinded; and be it further\n\nResolved, That the Governor of the state of Michigan is hereby requested to confer with the Governor of the state of Ohio concerning the subject matter hereof with a view to requesting the legislatures to establish a boundary commission to investigate and to report to the legislatures the rights of the respective states within Lake Erie; and be it further\n\nResolved, That a copy of this concurrent resolution be sent to the Governor of this state.\n\nHistory:1947, H.C.R. 38, Eff.
