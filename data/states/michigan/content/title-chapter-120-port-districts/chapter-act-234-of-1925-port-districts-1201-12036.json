Such comprehensive port plan shall include an indication of the relationship of the area designated as the port area by the comprehensive port plan to land transportation and other land uses related to port activities. The port commission shall submit to the legislative body of any city, village or township, for its approval, that portion of the comprehensive plan which includes territory lying within the boundaries of the said city, village or township. Such submission shall be made by delivering the said portion of the comprehensive port plan to the clerk of the city, village or township involved, and if approved by the legislative body thereof, shall take effect from the date of such approval. If within 180 days after submission the legislative body of such city, village or township fails to disapprove such portion of the plan as shall have been submitted, it shall be thereupon presumed that such city, village or township has approved the same and such portion of the plan shall become effective without further notice. If the legislative body of the city, village or township to which a portion of the plan as amended or altered has been submitted disapproves the same, the commission may proceed to make such public improvements on lands leased or owned by the port commission as are prescribed in said plan to be made in the other part or parts of the port district. The port commission shall have the power to amend or alter the comprehensive port plan: Provided, however, That wherever such amendments or alterations of the comprehensive port plan include any area or territory lying within a city, village or township, that portion of the amendment or alteration shall be submitted to the legislative body of said city, village or township for its approval. Such submission shall be made by delivering the said portion of the comprehensive port plan, as amended or altered, to the clerk of the city, village or township involved, and if approved by the legislative body thereof, shall take effect from the date of such approval.

Wherever the legislative body of any city, village or township has approved that portion of the comprehensive port plan which includes the area or territory of such city, village or township, it shall be the duty of the port commission to recommend the zoning district classifications for the area to said legislative body: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as conferring, directly or indirectly, upon said port district, or port district commission or authority, power or powers to acquire, own, maintain or operate the Detroit, Michigan—Windsor, Ontario, Canada tunnel or international bridge: And provided further, That where any language in said act is in conflict with this prohibition, then and in that event any such language shall be deemed to be void and of no force or effect.\n\nHistory:1925, Act 234, Eff.
