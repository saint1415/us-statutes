Failure to make the lien searches required by this subsection shall result in liability only to valid lienholders injured by that failure.\n\n(9) Before a sale of personal property pursuant to this section, a holder of a prior lien on any of the property to be sold may pay the operator the amount of the operator's lien attributable to storage of the property, including the reasonable expenses incurred by the operator under this section.
