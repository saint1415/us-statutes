Unless the agreement of sale provides otherwise, a sale under this section is free and clear of a lien of the person that obtained appointment of the receiver, any subordinate lien, and any right of redemption but is subject to a senior lien.\n\n(4) A lien on receivership property that is extinguished by a transfer under subsection (3) attaches to the proceeds of the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority the lien had on the property immediately before the transfer, even if the proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy all obligations secured by the lien.\n\n(5) A transfer under subsection (3) may occur by means other than a public auction sale.

The court may condition the receiver's adoption and continued performance of the contract on terms appropriate under the circumstances. If the receiver does not request court approval to adopt or reject the contract within a reasonable time after the receiver's appointment, the receiver is deemed to have rejected the contract.\n\n(3) A receiver's performance of an executory contract before court approval under subsection (2) of its adoption or rejection is not an adoption of the contract and does not preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject the contract.\n\n(4) A provision in an executory contract that requires or permits a forfeiture, modification, or termination of the contract because of the appointment of a receiver or the financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiver's power under subsection (2) to adopt the contract.\n\n(5) A receiver's right to possess or use receivership property pursuant to an executory contract terminates on rejection of the contract under subsection (2). Rejection is a breach of the contract effective immediately before appointment of the receiver.
