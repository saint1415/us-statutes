The security interest in rents is separate and distinct from any security interest held by the assignee in the real property.\n\n(3) A discharge of a security instrument discharges by operation of law any assignment of rents made in connection with the discharged security instrument.\n\n(4) Upon a foreclosure of the security instrument, all of the following apply:\n\n(a) The assignment of rents made in connection with the security instrument continues to be effective to the extent of the remaining secured obligation and transfers to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale by operation of law whether or not the foreclosure notice makes reference to the assignment of rents. Any transfer of the foreclosure deed by the holder of the deed also transfers the assignment of rents to the transferee by operation of law.\n\n(b) The assignment of rents made in connection with the security instrument automatically terminates upon the earlier of the following:\n\n(i) Redemption from the foreclosure sale.\n\n(ii) Expiration of the redemption period without redemption. For purposes of this subparagraph, the assignment of rents in connection with any subordinate security instrument automatically terminates.\n\n(5) This act does not apply to an assignment of rents regarding an interest in real property improved by 1 to 4 dwelling units unless 1 or more of the following apply:\n\n(a) The interest is used for agricultural, commercial, industrial, or mineral-extraction purposes, other than incidental uses by an assignor occupying the property as the assignor's primary residence.\n\n(b) The interest secures an obligation incurred at a time when the property was used or planned for use for agricultural, commercial, industrial, or mineral-extraction purposes.\n\n(c) The assignor planned or is planning to develop the property into 1 or more dwelling units to be sold or leased in the ordinary course of the owner's business.\n\n(d) The assignor is collecting or has the right to collect rents or other income from the property from a person other than an affiliate of the assignor.\n\nHistory:2022, Act 115, Eff.

However, the following form of notification, when properly completed, is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 9:NOTIFICATION TO PAY RENTS TO PERSON OTHER THAN LANDLORDYour landlord, ______________, owes a debt to ______________ (the assignee). In the landlord's and assignee's agreement about the debt owed by your landlord, there is a provision about \"assignment of rents\" that provides that if the landlord defaults in the landlord's obligations under the landlord's and assignee's agreement, the assignee has a right to collect rent directly from the landlord's tenants.Pursuant to this notice, the assignee is enforcing the assignee's rights to collect rent directly from the landlord's tenants. You are now required to pay rent directly to the assignee, as instructed by this notice. This is because you now have a legal duty to pay your rent directly to the assignee rather than to your landlord. If you pay your rent directly to the assignee after receipt of this notice, your landlord cannot legally claim that you owe rent during the period you paid your rent directly to the assignee. You must continue paying rent directly to the assignee until you receive an order from the court telling you to stop paying your rent directly to the assignee or instructing you on whom to pay rent to, or the assignee sends you a written notice that you should stop paying rent directly to the assignee.Tenant:_____________________________________________________Name of TenantProperty Occupied by Tenant (the \"Premises\"): _______________AddressLandlord:___________________________________________________Name of LandlordAssignee:___________________________________________________Name of AssigneeAddress of Assignee and Telephone Number of Contact Person:_____________________________________________________________Address of Assignee_____________________________________________________________Telephone Number of Person to Contact1.

The Landlord is in default under the Assignment of Rents. Under the Assignment of Rents, the Assignee is entitled to collect rents from the Premises.\n\n3. This notification affects your rights and obligations under the rental agreement under which you occupy the Premises (your \"Rental Agreement\"). In order to provide you with an opportunity to consult with a lawyer, if your next scheduled rental payment is due within 30 days after you receive this notification, neither the Assignee nor the Landlord can hold you in default under your Rental Agreement for nonpayment of that rental payment until 10 days after the due date of that payment or 30 days following the date you receive this notification, whichever occurs first. You may consult a lawyer at your expense concerning your rights and obligations under your Rental Agreement and the effect of this notification.\n\n4. You must pay to the Assignee at the address listed above all rents under your Rental Agreement which are due and payable on the date you receive this notification and all rents accruing under your Rental Agreement after you receive this notification. If you pay rents to the Assignee after receiving this notification, the payment will satisfy your rental obligation to the extent of that payment.\n\n5. Unless you occupy the premises as your primary residence, if you pay any rents to the Landlord after receiving this notification, your payment to the Landlord will not discharge your rental obligation, and the Assignee may hold you liable for that rental obligation notwithstanding your payment to the Landlord.\n\n6. Any modification of the Rental Agreement is not binding on the Assignee without the Assignee's written consent.\n\n7. If you have previously received a notification from another person that also holds an assignment of the rents due under your Rental Agreement, you should continue paying your rents to the person that sent that notification until that person cancels that notification. Once that notification is canceled, you must begin paying rents to the Assignee in accordance with this notification.\n\n8. Your obligation to pay rents to the Assignee will continue until you receive either:\n\n(a) a written order from a court directing you to pay the rent in a manner specified in that order; or\n\n(b) written instructions from the Assignee canceling this notification._________________________________Name of AssigneeBy:_____________________________Signature of Officer/Authorized Representative of Assignee_________________________________Name and Title of Officer/Authorized Representative\n\nHistory:2022, Act 115, Eff.

Any sums recovered in the action must be applied in the manner specified in section 12.\n\n(6) Unless otherwise agreed, if an assignee entitled to priority under section 5(3) enforces its interest in rents after another creditor holding a subordinate security interest in rents has enforced its interest under section 8 or 9, the creditor holding the subordinate security interest in rents is not obligated to turn over any proceeds that it collects in good faith before the creditor receives notification that the senior assignee has enforced its interest in rents. The creditor shall turn over to the senior assignee any proceeds that it collects after it receives the notification.\n\nHistory:2022, Act 115, Eff. Sept. 22, 2022",
