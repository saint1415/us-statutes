      "text": "The legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n\n(a) That the state capitol, which was designed by renowned architect Elijah Myers, remains 1 of the most impressive state capitols in the United States. Construction of the state capitol took 6 years, from 1872 to 1878, and it was dedicated to the people of the state of Michigan in 1879, at a cost of $1,500,000.00. From 1989 to 1992, the state capitol underwent a thorough restoration designed to return it to its former beauty and ensure that it continues to serve as the seat of Michigan state government. The restoration was designed to preserve an irreplaceable piece of Michigan history, art, and architecture, while preparing it for another 100 years of service.\n\n(b) That the grounds of the state capitol contain monuments that commemorate some of the most important events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and that serve as dramatic reminders of the sacrifices made by many generations to preserve the freedoms enjoyed by those in the twenty-first century, including all of the following:\n\n(i) The Grand Army of the Republic Memorial, the First Michigan Sharpshooters Monument, the Engineers Monument, and the statue of Governor Austin Blair, which honor individuals and units involved in the American Civil War.\n\n(ii) The Hiker Memorial, which recognizes veterans of the Spanish-American War, the Philippine Insurrection, and the China Relief Expedition.\n\n(iii) The Michigan Veterans Memorial, which recognizes the contributions and sacrifices of Michigan veterans in World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.\n\n(iv) The Freedom Tree, which honors all those captured and made prisoners of war or missing in action.\n\n(c) That, in 1992, the state capitol was awarded a National Preservation Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the highest such award in the country, recognizing both the challenge and the success of its magnificent restoration. The state capitol has also been designated as a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service, a distinction granted only to the most historically important and significant national sites.\n\nHistory:2013, Act 240, Eff.
