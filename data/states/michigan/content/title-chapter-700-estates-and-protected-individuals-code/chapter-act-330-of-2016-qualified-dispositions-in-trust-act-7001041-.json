If the property that is subject to the qualified disposition was first transferred to the trustee making the disposition or the predecessor trustee before the effective date of this act in a form that would otherwise meet the requirements of a qualified disposition, the qualified disposition is considered to have been made as of the effective date of this act.\n\n(b) Both of the following requirements:\n\n(i) The requirements of section 2(p)(ii).\n\n(ii) The requirements to be considered a qualified disposition or its equivalent under the laws of another state.\n\n(6) If a trustee of an existing trust proposes to make a disposition that, but for the exercise of authority granted in this subsection, would not be a qualified disposition because of a nonconforming power of appointment of the transferor, the trustee may modify the trust instrument by delivering to the qualified trustee an irrevocable written election to modify the nonconforming power of appointment to conform to the requirements of section 4(2)(c) or section 4(2)(k). An irrevocable written election described in this section must include both of the following:\n\n(a) A description of the modified power of appointment.\n\n(b) The transferor's written consent to the modification.

The former trustee does not have any power described in section 4(2) except to convey the trust property to the successor trustee and, at the former trustee's election, to petition the court for appointment of a successor trustee and collect its attorney fees, costs, and expenses. If the trust instrument does not provide for a successor trustee and the trust would otherwise be without a trustee, all of the following apply:\n\n(a) The probate court, on the request of a qualified trust beneficiary of the trust, shall appoint a successor trustee on the terms and conditions it determines to be consistent with the purposes of the trust and this act.\n\n(b) A former trustee may, but has no duty to, petition the probate court to appoint a successor trustee if a petition for appointment of a successor trustee is not brought by a qualified trust beneficiary within 30 days after the date on which the former trustee ceases to be a trustee of the trust. If the former trustee elects to petition for the appointment of a successor trustee, the former trustee is entitled to reimbursement for all attorney fees, costs, and expenses associated with the petition, and the amount of the attorney fees, costs, and expenses is a lien against the trust's property.\n\n(10) A valid lien attaching to property before a qualified disposition of the property survives the disposition, and the trustee takes title to the property subject to the valid lien and the trustee is subject to any agreements that created or perfected the valid lien.\n\n(11) A written agreement between a transferor and a creditor may provide for any of the following:\n\n(a) The transferor will have a continuing or periodic obligation to disclose any qualified dispositions to the creditor.\n\n(b) A qualified disposition will require the prior written approval of the creditor.\n\n(c) That the transferor is under those other obligations as the creditor may require with respect to qualified dispositions.\n\n(12) If a transfer that would otherwise be a qualified disposition violates an agreement with a creditor described in subsection (11), with respect to the creditor only, the transfer is not a qualified disposition and this act does not affect the rights of the creditor.\n\nHistory:2016, Act 330, Eff.

The lien has priority over all other liens against the property, whether or not the other liens accrued or were recorded before the accrual of the lien created by this act.\n\n(ii) The qualified disposition is avoided subject to the fees, costs, preexisting rights, claims, and interests of the trustee and of any predecessor trustee that has not acted in bad faith.\n\n(b) If the court is satisfied that a trust beneficiary has not acted in bad faith, the avoidance of the qualified disposition is subject to the right of the trust beneficiary to retain any distribution received before the creditor's commencement of an action to avoid the qualified disposition. It is presumed that the trust beneficiary, including a trust beneficiary who is also a transferor of the trust, did not act in bad faith merely by creating the trust or by accepting a distribution made under the terms of the trust.\n\n(c) For purposes of this subsection, it is presumed that a trustee did not act in bad faith merely by accepting the property, with or without a qualified affidavit, or by making any distribution under the terms of the trust.\n\n(3) A creditor has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that a trustee or trust beneficiary acted in bad faith as required under subsection (2), except that, for a trust beneficiary who is also the transferor, the burden on the creditor is to prove that the transferor-beneficiary acted in bad faith by a preponderance of the evidence. This subsection provides substantive not procedural rights.\n\n(4) With respect to a qualified disposition, a levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien, sequestration, or other legal or equitable process is permitted only in those circumstances permitted by this act.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act or section 13 of the powers of appointment act of 1967, 1967 PA 224, MCL 556.123, a creditor does not have a right against the interest of a trust beneficiary in a trust or portion of a trust that was a qualified disposition solely because the trust beneficiary has the right to authorize or direct the trustee to pay all or part of the trust property in satisfaction of estate or inheritance taxes imposed on or with respect to the trust beneficiary's postdeath estate, or the debts of the trust beneficiary's postdeath estate, or the expenses of administering the trust beneficiary's postdeath estate, unless the trust beneficiary actually directs the payment of the taxes, debts, or expenses, and then only to the extent of the direction.\n\n(6) Except as otherwise provided in the trust instrument, if a married couple make a qualified disposition of property and, immediately before the qualified disposition, the property, any part of the property, or any accumulation to the property was, under applicable law, owned by the married couple as tenants by the entireties, then notwithstanding the qualified disposition, the property, any part of the property, or any accumulation to the property is, while held in trust during the lifetime of both spouses, treated as though it were tenancy by the entireties property. In an action concerning whether a creditor of either or both spouses may recover the debt from the trust, on avoidance of the qualified disposition, the sole remedy available to the creditor with respect to trust property treated as though it were tenancy by the entireties property is an order directing the trustee to transfer the property to both spouses as tenants by the entireties.\n\n(7) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), on avoidance of a qualified disposition to the extent permitted under subsection (1), the sole remedy available to the creditor is an order directing the trustee to transfer to the transferor the amount necessary to satisfy the transferor's debt to the creditor at whose instance the disposition has been avoided.\n\nHistory:2016, Act 330, Eff.

The trustee is entitled to reimbursement for all attorney fees, costs, and expenses associated with carrying out this duty, and the amount of the attorney fees, costs, and expenses is a lien against the property that is the subject of the qualified disposition. A trustee is not liable, and a trust beneficiary or any successor trust beneficiary does not have a claim or cause of action against a trustee, for a breach of this duty unless the trustee's breach was in bad faith or the result of reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the trust beneficiaries.\n\n(4) This section does not prohibit a beneficiary from disclaiming an interest in a trust or portion of a trust that is a qualified disposition or from exercising a power of appointment.\n\nHistory:2016, Act 330, Eff.
