      "text": "WHEREAS, Section 1 of Article V of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the Governor;\n\nWHEREAS, Section 2 of Article V of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the Governor to make changes in the organization of the Executive Branch or in the assignment of functions among its units that the Governor considers necessary for efficient administration;\n\nWHEREAS, facilities and operations for captive cervidae including deer, elk, moose, and reindeer, can have serious impacts on the state's wildlife population and the agricultural industry;\n\nWHEREAS, unlike domestic livestock species, when deer and elk escape from privately-owned cervidae livestock facilities and operations, they are indistinguishable from free-ranging deer and elk, and also pose a potential risk to native animals, such as the transmission of parasites and disease;\n\nWHEREAS, deer and other cervidae are migratory animals often moving substantial distances seasonally, magnifying potential impacts on Michigan's wildlife population;\n\nWHEREAS, Chronic Wasting Disease is an incurable neurological disease of deer and elk that can be spread directly from animal to animal, or indirectly from soil or surface to animal;\n\nWHEREAS, Chronic Wasting Disease was once considered to be a disease limited to small endemic areas of Western United States, but has recently been discovered in more than 15 states and in Canada.\n\nWHEREAS, while the disease has the potential to devastate Michigan's deer and elk population, with state action, and the cooperation of private industry, Michigan can work to prevent Chronic Wasting Disease and other potential problems to maintain a healthy and safe future for Michigan wildlife;\n\nWHEREAS, it is imperative that Michigan remain vigilant and act decisively in adopting measures to protect native deer and elk from Chronic Wasting Disease and reduce vulnerabilities to the spread of the disease;\n\nWHEREAS, in light of the potential impact on Michigan's wildlife population, the Governor's Chronic Wasting Disease Task Force, chaired by Dr. Howard Tanner, has recommended that the licensing, application, registration, and inspection functions for privately-owned cervidae livestock facilities and operations be transferred to the Department of Natural Resources;\n\nWHEREAS, the Governor's Chronic Wasting Disease Task Force has also recommended a complete audit of Michigan's privately-owned cervidae livestock facilities and operations, which under current budgetary conditions can most effectively be performed by the Department of Natural Resources;\n\nWHEREAS, it is necessary in the interests of efficient administration and effectiveness of government to effect changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government;\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Jennifer M.
