      "text": "Michigan has long been the hub of mobility, and for over 100 years, the economic fortunes of its businesses, communities, and families have been closely tied to that sector of industry.\n\nToday, the mobility sector is undergoing a period of unprecedented change. To secure its future prosperity, and to remain the global leader in this sector, Michigan must keep pace with this change. This will require a concerted, coordinated, and sustained effort across state government, as well as productive partnerships with stakeholders in the public and private sectors.\n\nThe Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, with its focus on aligning and strengthening this state's economic and workforce development activities, is well suited to serve as the locus of this effort.\n\nSection 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the governor.\n\nSection 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that the governor considers necessary for efficient administration.\n\nChanging the organization of the executive branch of state government is necessary in the interests of efficient administration and effectiveness of government.\n\nActing under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:\n\n1.
