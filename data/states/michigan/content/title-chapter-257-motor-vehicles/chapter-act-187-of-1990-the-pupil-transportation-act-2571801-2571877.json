If a school district authorizes its school bus drivers to signal pupils to cross in front of the stopped school bus, the signal shall be uniform throughout the school district.\n\n(4) The driver of a school bus shall not stop the bus for the purpose of receiving or discharging pupils in the following instances:\n\n(a) Within 200 feet of a public or private roadway intersection unless the stop is approved by the school administrator or entity under contract with a school to provide pupil transportation services.\n\n(b) Upon a limited access highway or freeway, or upon any other highway or roadway that has been divided into 2 roadways by leaving an intervening space, a physical barrier, or clearly divided sections so constructed as to impede vehicular traffic if the pupils are required to cross the roadway.\n\n(c) Upon a roadway constructed or marked to permit 3 or more separate lanes of vehicular traffic in either direction if the pupils are required to cross the roadway.\n\n(5) The driver of a school bus when using the alternately flashing overhead red lights shall not stop the bus on any highway or roadway for the purpose of receiving or discharging pupils under the following conditions:\n\n(a) If the lawful speed limit is more than 35 miles per hour and the stopped bus is not clearly and continuously visible to approaching vehicles on that highway or roadway for at least 400 feet. When the distance from the stopped bus to the end of the highway or roadway is less than 400 feet, clear and continuous visibility must be available from the bus to the end of the highway or roadway.\n\n(b) If the lawful speed limit is 35 miles per hour or less and the stopped bus is not clearly and continuously visible to approaching vehicles on that highway or roadway, for at least 200 feet. When the distance from the stopped bus to the end of the highway or roadway is less than 200 feet, clear and continuous visibility must be available from the bus to the end of the highway or roadway.\n\n(c) Within 50 feet of an intersection if the intersection is controlled by a traffic control signal.\n\n(6) A school may provide instruction on proper school bus etiquette which may include, but not be limited to, boarding and leaving the bus, evacuation of the bus in an emergency, and road crossing procedures and the correct hand signal in the district, if any. If a school uses school bus drivers for this instruction, the state board may reimburse the school for this training.\n\n(7) For the purpose of this section, \"required to cross the roadway\" does not include crossing the roadway with the assistance of a traffic control signal, or with the assistance of a school crossing guard as defined in section 57b of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.57b, and applies only to the roadway on which the stop is being made.\n\n(8) For purposes of this section, a school bus is clearly and continuously visible if both of the following standards are satisfied:\n\n(a) Approaching traffic is able to see the front of a school bus extending from the roofline to and including the headlamps at the distances specified in subsection (5).\n\n(b) Approaching traffic is able to see the back of a school bus extending from the roofline to and including the tail lamps and stop lamps at the distances specified in subsection (5).\n\nHistory:1990, Act 187, Eff.
