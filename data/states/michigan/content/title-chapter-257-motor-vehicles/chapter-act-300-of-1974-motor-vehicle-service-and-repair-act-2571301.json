If a waiver is not signed under subsection (3) and the estimated price is exceeded by not more than 10% or $50.00, whichever is lesser, the facility is not required to obtain the written or oral consent of the customer for the excess charge unless specifically requested by the customer. This section shall not be construed as requiring a motor vehicle repair facility, mechanic, or mechanic trainee to give a written estimated price if the facility, mechanic, or trainee agrees not to perform the requested repair.

The facility shall indicate those costs in written form, itemizing the costs as closely as possible with a copy given to the customer. The cost of a diagnosis made by the facility, whether or not the customer authorizes the facility to perform those repairs, shall be included in the written estimate before the diagnosis is undertaken.\n\n(3) If a customer initiates a request for service or parts for the repair of a motor vehicle without receiving a written estimate and voluntarily agrees to pay all reasonable costs of repair up to an amount stated by the customer, a facility may obtain from the customer a waiver of his or her right to receive a prior estimate of repair costs. The waiver shall be in 14 point or larger bold capital type face and executed with 1 copy to the customer who is requesting the repairs. The waiver shall read as follows:\n\n\"I, __________, voluntarily authorize __________ to provide services or parts in the repair of the below described motor vehicle without receiving an estimate of repair costs.
