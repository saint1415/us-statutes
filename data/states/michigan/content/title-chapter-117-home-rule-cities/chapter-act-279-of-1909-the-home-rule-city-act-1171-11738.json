      "text": "Each city charter shall provide for all of the following:\n\n(a) The election of a mayor, who shall be the chief executive officer of the city, and of a body vested with legislative power, and for the election or appointment of a clerk, a treasurer, an assessor or board of assessors, a board of review, and other officers considered necessary. The city charter may provide for the selection of the mayor by the legislative body. Elections may be by a partisan, nonpartisan, or preferential ballot, or by any other legal method of voting. Notwithstanding another law or charter provision to the contrary, a city having a 1970 official population of more than 150,000, whose charter provides for terms of office of less than 4 years, and in which the term of office for the mayor and the governing body are of the same length, may provide by ordinance for a term of office of up to 4 years for mayor and other elected city officials. The ordinance shall provide that the ordinance shall take effect 60 days after it is enacted unless within the 60 days a petition is submitted to the city clerk signed by not less than 10% of the registered electors of the city requesting that the question of approval of the ordinance be submitted to the electors at the next regular election or a special election called for the purpose of approving or disapproving the ordinance.\n\n(b) The nomination of elective officers by partisan or nonpartisan primary, by petition, or by convention.\n\n(c) The time, manner, and means of holding elections and the registration of electors, subject to section 26 and other applicable requirements of law.\n\n(d) The qualifications, duties, and compensation of the city's officers. If the city has an appointed chief administrative officer, the legislative body of the city may enter into an employment contract with the chief administrative officer extending beyond the terms of the members of the legislative body unless the employment contract is prohibited by the city charter. An employment contract with a chief administrative officer shall be in writing and shall specify the compensation to be paid to the chief administrative officer, any procedure for changing the compensation, any fringe benefits, and other conditions of employment. The contract shall state if the chief administrative officer serves at the pleasure of the legislative body, and the contract may provide for severance pay or other benefits in the event the chief administrative officer's employment is terminated at the pleasure of the legislative body.\n\n(e) The establishment of 1 or more wards, and if the members of the city's legislative body are chosen by wards, for equal representation for each ward in the legislative body.\n\n(f) That the subjects of taxation for municipal purposes are the same as for state, county, and school purposes under the general law.\n\n(g) The annual laying and collecting taxes in a sum, except as otherwise provided by law, not to exceed 2% of the taxable value of the real and personal property in the city. Unless the charter provides for a different tax rate limitation, the governing body of a city may levy and collect taxes for municipal purposes in a sum not to exceed 1% of the taxable value of the real and personal property in the city. As used in this subdivision, \"taxable value\" is that value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.\n\n(h) An annual appropriation of money for municipal purposes.\n\n(i) The levy, collection, and return of state, county, and school taxes in conformance with the general laws of this state, except that the preparation of the assessment roll, the meeting of the board of review, and the confirmation of the assessment roll may be at the times provided in the city charter.\n\n(j) The public peace and health and for the safety of persons and property. In providing for the public peace, health, and safety, a city may expend funds or enter into contracts with a private organization, the federal or state government, a county, village, or township, or another city for services considered necessary by the legislative body. Public peace, health, and safety services may include the operation of child guidance and community mental health clinics, the prevention, counseling, and treatment of developmental disabilities, the prevention of drug abuse, and the counseling and treatment of drug abusers.\n\n(k) Adopting, continuing, amending, and repealing the city ordinances and for the publication of each ordinance before it becomes operative. Whether or not provided in its charter, instead of publishing a true copy of an ordinance before it becomes operative, the city may publish a summary of the ordinance. If the city publishes a summary of the ordinance, the city shall include in the publication the designation of a location in the city where a true copy of the ordinance can be inspected or obtained. A charter provision to the contrary notwithstanding, a city may adopt an ordinance punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both, if the violation substantially corresponds to a violation of state law that is a misdemeanor for which the maximum period of imprisonment is 93 days. Whether or not provided in its charter, a city may adopt a provision of a state statute for which the maximum period of imprisonment is 93 days or the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923. Except as otherwise provided under the Stille-DeRossett-Hale single state construction code act, 1972 PA 230, MCL 125.1501 to 125.1531, a city may adopt a law, code, or rule that has been promulgated and adopted by an authorized agency of this state pertaining to fire, fire hazards, fire prevention, or fire waste, and a fire prevention code, plumbing code, heating code, electrical code, building code, refrigeration machinery code, piping code, boiler code, boiler operation code, elevator machinery code, an international property maintenance code, or a code pertaining to flammable liquids and gases or hazardous chemicals, that has been promulgated or adopted by this state, by a department, board, or other agency of this state, or by an organization or association that is organized and conducted for the purpose of developing the code, by reference to the law, code, or rule in an adopting ordinance and without publishing the law, code, or rule in full. The law, code, or rule shall be clearly identified in the ordinance and its purpose shall be published with the adopting ordinance. Printed copies of the law, code, or rule shall be kept in the office of the city clerk, available for inspection by, and distribution to, the public at all times. The publication shall contain a notice stating that a complete copy of the law, code, or rule is made available to the public at the office of the city clerk in compliance with state law requiring that records of public bodies be made available to the general public. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, a city shall not enforce a provision adopted by reference for which the maximum period of imprisonment is greater than 93 days. A city may adopt section 625(1)(c) of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.625, by reference in an adopting ordinance and shall provide that a violation of that ordinance is punishable by 1 or more of the following:\n\n(i) Community service for not more than 360 hours.\n\n(ii) Imprisonment for not more than 180 days.\n\n(iii) A fine of not less than $200.00 or more than $700.00.\n\n(l) That the business of the legislative body shall be conducted at a public meeting held in compliance with the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275. All records of the municipality shall be made available to the general public in compliance with the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.\n\n(m) Keeping in the English language a written or printed journal of each session of the legislative body.\n\n(n) A system of accounts that conforms to a uniform system of accounts as required by law.\n\nHistory:1909, Act 279, Eff.

      "text": "(1) A city that has a population of not less than 750,000 as determined by the most recent federal decennial census and that has a city council composed of 9 at-large council members shall place a question in substantially the following form on the ballot at the general primary election held on Tuesday, August 6, 2002:\"Shall the existing 9-member at-large city council be abolished, shall the city be reapportioned into 9 single-member election districts, and shall district residency requirements be imposed on candidates for the city council?Yes (_____)No (_____).\".(2) The result of the vote shall be canvassed by the local board of canvassers under the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.1 to 168.992.\n\n(3) If the question presented pursuant to subsection (1) is approved, the 9-member at-large city council is abolished on January 1, 2006 and shall be replaced by a city council of 9 members elected from single-member election districts at regular municipal elections beginning with the municipal primary election in 2005. Any charter provision to the contrary notwithstanding, the president of the city council shall be determined by a majority vote of the city council members elected and serving from single-member election districts.\n\n(4) Within 30 days after the question presented pursuant to subsection (1) is approved, the city redistricting commission shall meet as the apportionment commission and adopt an apportionment plan. The city redistricting commission shall consist of 3 members, 2 of whom are appointed by the mayor and 1 of whom is appointed by the city council. The city redistricting commission shall thereafter meet within 30 days after the publication of the latest official figures of the federal decennial census to reapportion the city. To the extent consistent with this act, the procedural aspects of the apportionment process shall be governed by the same statutory procedures as those provided for a county charter commission apportionment pursuant to section 5(4), (5), (6), and (7) of 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.505. One of the 2 members appointed by the mayor under this subsection shall convene the city redistricting commission, sitting as the apportionment commission. As the apportionment commission, the city redistricting commission shall adopt its own rules of procedure. Two members shall constitute a quorum and all actions shall be by a majority vote.\n\n(5) The city redistricting commission shall provide for equal representation for each single-member election district, and each single-member election district shall be as nearly equal in population and compact as is practicable based on the latest federal decennial census. In developing an apportionment plan, the city redistricting commission shall follow the lines used for planning sectors and subcommittees as provided by the city master plan and charter. In subsequent reapportionments, the city redistricting commission apportionment plan shall make only incremental changes to the single-member election district boundaries that are necessary to accommodate population change requirements. Each single-member election district shall be designated by number.\n\n(6) Each candidate for city council shall be a resident of the single-member election district he or she seeks to represent. A city council member's office is vacated if the member moves his or her residence outside of the single-member election district that the member represents.\n\n(7) To comply with and implement this section, the city clerk shall promulgate necessary election rules and procedures consistent with other provisions of the city charter. The city council may amend the charter to comply with the intent and findings of this section in the same manner provided by law and charter for the adoption of an ordinance. However, any charter amendment to comply with the intent and findings of this section shall take effect immediately upon adoption by the council. The city clerk shall file a copy of any charter amendment with the secretary of state and the county clerk of the county in which the city is located.

A city may in its charter allow for a contract, upon the terms, including terms of present or deferred payment, and upon the conditions and in the manner as the city considers proper, to purchase, operate, and maintain any existing public utility property for supplying water, heat, light, power, or transportation to the city and the city's inhabitants. The contract does not bind the city unless the proposition for the contract receives the affirmative vote of 3/5 of the electors voting at a regular or special election. For the purchase of a transportation utility, the charter amendment and the contract to purchase may provide for a sinking fund, into which must be paid, from the earnings of the utility, sums sufficient to purchase the utility and perform the obligations of the contract. Within a reasonable time after the acquisition of a public transportation utility, a system of civil service for the selection and retention of its employees must be established. If a vote is taken to amend a city charter to allow an acquisition under this subdivision, a vote may also be taken at the same election to approve a particular contract. The vote upon the charter amendment and upon the purchase contract must be by separate ballots. If a transportation utility is acquired under this subdivision, state taxes and local taxes on any portion of the property lying outside of the city limits must be paid as if privately owned. The powers under this subdivision are in addition to any other powers provided for under this section.\n\n(b) For owning, constructing, and operating transportation facilities within the city limits, and its adjacent and adjoining suburbs within a distance of 10 miles from any portion of the city limits.\n\n(c) For the purchase and condemnation of private property for any public use or purpose within the scope of its powers; for the acquirement, ownership, establishment, construction, and operation, either within or outside its corporate limits, of public utilities for supplying water, light, heat, power, and transportation to the city and the city's inhabitants, for domestic, commercial, and municipal purposes; for the sale of heat, power, and light outside its corporate limits in an amount as determined by the governing body of the utility supplying the heat, power, or light except that electric delivery service is limited to the area of any village or township that was contiguous to the city as of June 20, 1974, and to the area of any other village or township being served as of June 20, 1974 and retail sales of electric generation service are limited to the area of any city, village, or township that was contiguous to the city, village, or township as of June 20, 1974, and to the area of any other city, village, or township being served as of June 20, 1974; for the sale and delivery of water outside of its corporate limits in the amount as may be determined by the legislative body of the city; and for the operation of transportation lines outside the city and within 10 miles from its corporate limits. A city shall not render electric delivery service for heat, power, or light outside its corporate limits to a customer that is currently receiving or within the previous 3 years has received that service from another utility unless that utility consents in writing. The acquirement of a utility together with all properties, franchises, and rights necessary for its establishment, ownership, construction, operation, improvement, extension, and maintenance, whether the properties, franchises, and rights are situated within or outside the corporate limits of the city, may be either by purchase or condemnation. If the acquirement is by condemnation, 1911 PA 149, MCL 213.21 to 213.25, may be used for instituting and prosecuting the condemnation proceedings. A public utility is not acquired unless the proposition to do so first receives the affirmative vote of 3/5 of the electors of the city voting at a regular or special municipal election. As used in this subdivision:\n\n(i) \"Customer\" means only the building or facilities served rather than the individual, association, partnership, corporation, governmental body, or any other entity taking service.\n\n(ii) \"Electric delivery service\" has the same meaning as \"delivery service\" under section 10y of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.10y.\n\n(iii) \"Electric generation service\" means the sale of electric power and related ancillary services.\n\n(d) For the acquiring, establishment, operation, extension, and maintenance of sewage disposal systems, sewers, and plants, either within or outside the corporate limits of the city, as a utility, including the right to acquire necessary property by purchase, gift, or condemnation, and including the fixing and collecting of charges exclusively for service covering the cost of the service. This subdivision allows a return on the fair value of the property devoted to the service, excluding the valuations of the portions of the system that were paid for by special assessment, which may be made as a lien upon the property served and if not paid when due, collected in the same manner as other city taxes.\n\nHistory:Add. 1927, Act 367, Eff.

A violation notice to appear at an administrative hearings bureau shall be treated as made under oath if the violation alleged in the notice occurred in the presence of the authorized local official signing the violation notice and if the notice contains the following statement immediately above the date and signature of the official: \"I declare under the penalties of perjury that the statements above are true to the best of my information, knowledge, and belief.\". An authorized local official may issue a violation notice to appear if, based upon investigation, the official has reasonable cause to believe that the person is responsible for a blight violation and if the city attorney or an assistant city attorney approves in writing the issuance of the violation notice.\n\n(6) If a city has a rental inspection program with which a landlord must register in order to rent premises for residential purposes and if a landlord of premises rented in the city for residential purposes is registered with the city's rental inspection program, the city shall not issue a blight violation notice during an inspection of the premises unless either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) The landlord is given a written correction notice of the violation and a reasonable opportunity to correct the circumstances before a reinspection of the premises or a date specified in the notice.\n\n(b) The violation is a direct result of the landlord's action or inaction and creates an emergency that presents an immediate risk of harm to people or damage to property including, but not limited to, a flooded basement or premises without heat.\n\n(7) A city that does not have a rental inspection program, or does not require a landlord to register as part of a rental inspection program, shall not issue a blight violation notice to a landlord of premises rented in the city for residential purposes during an inspection of the premises unless either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) The landlord is given a written correction notice of the violation and a reasonable opportunity to correct the circumstances before a reinspection of the premises or a date specified in the notice.\n\n(b) The violation is a direct result of the landlord's action or inaction and creates an emergency that presents an immediate risk of harm to people or damage to property, including, but not limited to, a flooded basement or premises without heat.\n\n(8) The person named in the violation notice shall appear on or before the time specified in the violation notice and may respond to the allegations in the notice, as follows:\n\n(a) If the alleged violator wishes to admit responsibility for the blight violation, the person may do so by appearing in person, by representation, or by mail. If appearance is made by representation or mail, the administrative hearings bureau may accept the admission as though the person personally appeared. Upon acceptance of the admission, a hearing officer may order any of the sanctions permitted under this section.\n\n(b) If the alleged violator wishes to deny responsibility for the blight violation, or admit responsibility with an explanation, the person may do so by appearing in person on the date scheduled for the administrative hearing for the purpose of adjudicating the alleged violation.\n\n(c) If the alleged violator fails to appear, a decision and order of default may be entered.\n\n(9) If an admission of responsibility is not made and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by charter or ordinance for the violation are not paid at the administrative hearings bureau, and the alleged violator fails to appear at a hearing scheduled in accordance with this section, a final decision and order of responsibility in the amount of the prescribed civil fine and costs may be issued by the administrative hearings bureau.\n\n(10) The city establishing an administrative hearings bureau shall establish rules and procedures for an alleged violator to set aside the entry of a decision and order of default.\n\n(11) The ordinance establishing the bureau shall provide for adjudicatory hearings by hearing officers. Each hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in this state for at least 5 years. Hearing officers shall be appointed in a manner consistent with the charter of the city for the appointment of other municipal officers or employees and shall only be removed for reasonable cause.

The determination shall be in writing and shall include written findings of fact, a decision, and an order. The city shall have the burden of establishing the responsibility of the alleged violator by a preponderance of the evidence. Unless the burden is met, the matter shall be dismissed. A decision and an order shall not be made except upon consideration of the record as a whole or a portion of the record as may be cited by any party to the proceeding and as supported by and in accordance with the competent, material, and substantial evidence. A decision and order finding the alleged violator responsible for the violation shall include the civil fine, if any, or any action with which the violator must comply, or both.\n\n(e) Imposing reasonable and proportionate sanctions consistent with applicable ordinance provisions and assessing costs upon a finding that the alleged violator is responsible for the alleged violation. The maximum monetary civil fine allowed under this section excludes costs of enforcement or costs imposed to secure compliance with the city's ordinances and is not applicable to enforce the collection of any tax imposed and collected by the city.\n\n(13) In addition to fines and costs imposed under subsection (12), the hearing officer shall impose a justice system assessment of $10.00 for each blight violation determination. Upon payment of the assessment, the city shall transmit the assessment collected to the state treasury to be deposited into the justice system fund created in section 181 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.181.\n\n(14) A party shall be provided with the opportunity for a hearing during which they may be represented by counsel, present witnesses, and cross-examine witnesses. A party may request the hearing officer to issue subpoenas to direct the attendance and testimony of relevant witnesses and the production of relevant documents. Hearings shall be scheduled with reasonable promptness, except that for hearings scheduled in all nonemergency situations the alleged violator if he or she requests shall have at least 14 days after service of process to prepare for the hearing. For purposes of this subsection, \"nonemergency situation\" means any situation that does not reasonably constitute a threat to the public interest, safety, or welfare. If service is provided by first-class mail, the 14-day period begins to run on the day that the notice is deposited in the mail.\n\n(15) In an administrative hearing under this section, the rules of evidence as applied in a nonjury civil case in circuit court shall be followed as far as practicable, but the hearing officer may admit and give probative effect to evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded. Effect shall be given to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to offers of evidence may be made and shall be noted in the record. Subject to these requirements, the hearing officer, for the purpose of expediting hearings and when the interests of the parties will not be substantially prejudiced thereby, may provide in an administrative hearing or by rule for submission of all or part of the evidence in written form.\n\n(16) Any final decision by a hearing officer that a blight violation does or does not exist constitutes a final decision and order for purposes of judicial review and may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(17) A party may file an appeal within 28 days after entry of the decision and order by the hearing officer. An appeal of a final decision and order of an administrative hearing officer is to the circuit court.\n\n(18) An alleged violator who appeals a final decision and order to circuit court shall post with the administrative hearings bureau, at the time the appeal is taken, a bond equal to the fine and costs imposed. A party who has paid the fine and costs is not required to post a bond. If a party who has posted a bond fails to comply with the requirements of supreme court rules for an appeal to the circuit court, the appeal may be considered abandoned, and the bureau may dismiss the appeal on 7 days' notice to the parties. The administrative hearings bureau must promptly notify the circuit court of a dismissal, and the circuit court shall dismiss the claim of appeal. If the appeal is dismissed or the decision and order are affirmed, the administrative hearings bureau may apply the bond to the fine and costs. An appeal by the city must be asserted by the city's attorney and a bond is not required.\n\n(19) An appeal to circuit court shall be a review by the court of the certified record provided by the administrative hearings bureau. Pending appeal, and subject to the bond requirement under subsection (18), the hearing officer may stay the order and any sanctions or costs imposed. Once an appeal is filed, and subject to the bond requirement under subsection (18), the court may stay the order and any sanctions or costs imposed. The court, as appropriate, may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision or order, or remand the matter for further proceedings. The court shall hold unlawful and set aside a decision or order of the hearing officer if substantial rights of an alleged violator have been prejudiced because the decision or order is any of the following:\n\n(a) In violation of the constitution or a statute, charter, or ordinance.\n\n(b) In excess of the authority or jurisdiction of the agency as conferred by statute, charter, or ordinance.\n\n(c) Made upon unlawful procedure resulting in material prejudice to a party.\n\n(d) Not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\n\n(e) Arbitrary, capricious, or clearly an abuse or unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(f) Affected by other substantial and material error of law.\n\n(20) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (21) or (22), if the civil fine and costs imposed against a person under this section are $1,000.00 or more and the person does not pay the civil fine and costs imposed within 30 days after a final decision and order of the hearing officer or of the circuit court under this section, the person is subject to the following:\n\n(a) For a first violation, the person is responsible for a state civil infraction and may be ordered to pay a civil fine of not more than $500.00.\n\n(b) For a second violation, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.\n\n(c) For a third or subsequent violation, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor and may be imprisoned for not more than 1 year and shall be fined $500.00.\n\n(21) Subsection (20) does not apply to any of the following that becomes the owner of a property after foreclosure or after taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure:\n\n(a) A government-sponsored enterprise.

      "text": "***** 117.4q.amended THIS AMENDED SECTION IS EFFECTIVE 91 DAYS AFTER ADJOURNMENT OF THE 2024 REGULAR SESSION SINE DIE *****\n\n(1) A city that has a population of 7,500 or more and is located in any county, or a city that has a population of 3,300 or more and is located in a county that has a population of 1,500,000 or more, may establish an administrative hearings bureau to adjudicate and impose sanctions for violations of the charter or ordinances designated in the charter or ordinance as a blight violation. The bureau may accept admissions of responsibility for blight violations. Pursuant to a schedule of civil fines and costs, the bureau may collect civil fines and costs for blight violations.\n\n(2) The expense of operating an administrative hearings bureau is borne by the city establishing the bureau.\n\n(3) An administrative hearings bureau does not have jurisdiction over criminal offenses, traffic civil infractions, municipal civil infractions, or state civil infractions. The bureau and its hearing officers do not have the authority to impose a penalty of incarceration and may not impose a civil fine in excess of $10,000.00. This section does not authorize a proceeding against a foreclosing governmental unit as that term is defined under section 78 of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78, or an authority created under the land bank fast track act, 2003 PA 258, MCL 124.751 to 124.774. The city may waive a fine for a blight violation at an owner-occupied dwelling for a first time offender of a blight ordinance, if the offender has corrected the circumstances for the violation.\n\n(4) A city that establishes an administrative hearings bureau under this section shall establish by ordinance the jurisdiction of the bureau for adjudicating alleged blight violations, making determinations of responsibility, and imposing sanctions upon those found responsible for a violation. The city may designate only a violation of any of the following types of ordinances as a blight violation:\n\n(a) Zoning.\n\n(b) Building or property maintenance.\n\n(c) Solid waste and illegal dumping.\n\n(d) Disease and sanitation.\n\n(e) Noxious weeds.\n\n(f) Vehicle abandonment, inoperative vehicles, vehicle impoundment, and municipal vehicle licensing.\n\n(g) Right-of-way signage. For purposes of this subdivision, right-of-way signage violation means the placement of signage in a right-of-way without a proper permit from the city.\n\n(h) An ordinance that is substantially the same as sections 138 to 142 of the housing law of Michigan, 1917 PA 167, MCL 125.538 to 125.542.\n\n(5) To initiate a proceeding for a blight violation, the city shall issue and serve upon an alleged violator a written violation notice on which an authorized local official records the occurrence or existence of 1 or more blight violations by the person cited and that directs the named person to pay a civil fine for the violation or appear at the administrative hearings bureau as provided in this section. A violation notice to appear at an administrative hearings bureau must be treated as made under oath if the violation alleged in the notice occurred in the presence of the authorized local official signing the violation notice and if the notice contains the following statement immediately above the date and signature of the official: \"I declare under the penalties of perjury that the statements above are true to the best of my information, knowledge, and belief.\". An authorized local official may issue a violation notice to appear if, based upon investigation, the official has reasonable cause to believe that the person is responsible for a blight violation and if the city attorney or an assistant city attorney approves in writing issuing the violation notice.\n\n(6) If a city has a rental inspection program with which a landlord must register to rent premises for residential purposes and if a landlord of premises rented in the city for residential purposes is registered with the city's rental inspection program, the city shall not issue a blight violation notice during an inspection of the premises unless either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) The landlord is given a written correction notice of the violation and a reasonable opportunity to correct the circumstances before a reinspection of the premises or a date specified in the notice.\n\n(b) The violation is a direct result of the landlord's action or inaction and creates an emergency that presents an immediate risk of harm to people or damage to property including, but not limited to, a flooded basement or premises without heat.\n\n(7) A city that does not have a rental inspection program, or does not require a landlord to register as part of a rental inspection program, shall not issue a blight violation notice to a landlord of premises rented in the city for residential purposes during an inspection of the premises unless either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) The landlord is given a written correction notice of the violation and a reasonable opportunity to correct the circumstances before a reinspection of the premises or a date specified in the notice.\n\n(b) The violation is a direct result of the landlord's action or inaction and creates an emergency that presents an immediate risk of harm to people or damage to property, including, but not limited to, a flooded basement or premises without heat.\n\n(8) The person named in the violation notice shall appear on or before the time specified in the violation notice and may respond to the allegations in the notice, as follows:\n\n(a) If the alleged violator wishes to admit responsibility for the blight violation, the person may do so by appearing in person, by representation, or by mail. If appearance is made by representation or mail, the administrative hearings bureau may accept the admission as though the person personally appeared. Upon acceptance of the admission, a hearing officer may order any of the sanctions permitted under this section.\n\n(b) If the alleged violator wishes to deny responsibility for the blight violation, or admit responsibility with an explanation, the person may do so by appearing in person on the date scheduled for the administrative hearing for the purpose of adjudicating the alleged violation.\n\n(c) If the alleged violator fails to appear, a decision and order of default may be entered.\n\n(9) If an admission of responsibility is not made and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by charter or ordinance for the violation are not paid at the administrative hearings bureau, and the alleged violator fails to appear at a hearing scheduled in accordance with this section, a final decision and order of responsibility in the amount of the prescribed civil fine and costs may be issued by the administrative hearings bureau.\n\n(10) The city establishing an administrative hearings bureau shall establish rules and procedures for an alleged violator to set aside the entry of a decision and order of default.\n\n(11) The ordinance establishing the bureau must provide for adjudicatory hearings by hearing officers. Each hearing officer must be an attorney licensed to practice law in this state for at least 5 years. Hearing officers must be appointed in a manner consistent with the charter of the city for the appointment of other municipal officers or employees and must only be removed for reasonable cause. Before conducting administrative adjudication proceedings, administrative hearing officers must successfully complete a formal training program which includes all of the following:\n\n(a) Instruction on the rules of procedure of the administrative hearings that they will conduct.\n\n(b) Orientation to each subject area of the ordinance violations that they will adjudicate.\n\n(c) Observation of administrative hearings.\n\n(d) Participation in hypothetical cases, including ruling on evidence and issuing final orders.\n\n(e) The importance of impartiality in the conduct of the administrative hearing and adjudication of the violation.\n\n(f) Instructions on the preparation of a record that is adequate for judicial review.\n\n(12) The authority and duties of a hearing officer include all of the following:\n\n(a) Hearing testimony and accepting evidence that is relevant to the existence of the blight violation.\n\n(b) Issuing subpoenas directing witnesses to appear and give relevant testimony at the hearing, upon request of a party or a party's attorney.\n\n(c) Preserving and authenticating the record of the hearing and all exhibits and evidence introduced at the hearing.\n\n(d) Issuing a determination, based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, whether a blight violation exists. The determination must be in writing and must include written findings of fact, a decision, and an order. The city has the burden of establishing the responsibility of the alleged violator by a preponderance of the evidence. Unless the burden is met, the matter must be dismissed. A decision and an order must not be made except upon consideration of the record as a whole or a portion of the record as may be cited by any party to the proceeding and as supported by and in accordance with the competent, material, and substantial evidence. A decision and order finding the alleged violator responsible for the violation must include the civil fine, if any, or any action with which the violator must comply, or both.\n\n(e) Imposing reasonable and proportionate sanctions consistent with applicable ordinance provisions and assessing costs upon a finding that the alleged violator is responsible for the alleged violation. The maximum monetary civil fine allowed under this section excludes costs of enforcement or costs imposed to secure compliance with the city's ordinances and is not applicable to enforce the collection of any tax imposed and collected by the city.\n\n(13) In addition to fines and costs imposed under subsection (12), the hearing officer shall impose a justice system assessment of $10.00 for each blight violation determination. Upon payment of the assessment, the city shall transmit the assessment collected to the state treasury to be deposited into the justice system fund created in section 181 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.181.\n\n(14) A party must be provided with the opportunity for a hearing during which the party may be represented by counsel, present witnesses, and cross-examine witnesses. A party may request the hearing officer to issue subpoenas to direct the attendance and testimony of relevant witnesses and the production of relevant documents. Hearings must be scheduled with reasonable promptness, except that for hearings scheduled in all nonemergency situations the alleged violator if the alleged violator requests must have at least 14 days after service of process to prepare for the hearing. For purposes of this subsection, \"nonemergency situation\" means any situation that does not reasonably constitute a threat to the public interest, safety, or welfare. If service is provided by first-class mail, the 14-day period begins to run on the day that the notice is deposited in the mail.\n\n(15) In an administrative hearing under this section, the rules of evidence as applied in a nonjury civil case in circuit court must be followed as far as practicable, but the hearing officer may admit and give probative effect to evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded. Effect must be given to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to offers of evidence may be made and must be noted in the record. Subject to these requirements, the hearing officer, for the purpose of expediting hearings and when the interests of the parties will not be substantially prejudiced, may provide in an administrative hearing or by rule for submission of all or part of the evidence in written form.\n\n(16) Any final decision by a hearing officer that a blight violation does or does not exist constitutes a final decision and order for purposes of judicial review and may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(17) A party may file an appeal within 28 days after entry of the decision and order by the hearing officer. An appeal of a final decision and order of an administrative hearing officer is to the circuit court.\n\n(18) An alleged violator who appeals a final decision and order to circuit court shall post with the administrative hearings bureau, at the time the appeal is taken, a bond equal to the fine and costs imposed. A party who has paid the fine and costs is not required to post a bond. If a party who has posted a bond fails to comply with the requirements of supreme court rules for an appeal to the circuit court, the appeal may be considered abandoned, and the bureau may dismiss the appeal on 7 days' notice to the parties. The administrative hearings bureau shall promptly notify the circuit court of a dismissal, and the circuit court shall dismiss the claim of appeal. If the appeal is dismissed or the decision and order are affirmed, the administrative hearings bureau may apply the bond to the fine and costs. An appeal by the city must be asserted by the city's attorney and a bond is not required.\n\n(19) An appeal to circuit court must be a review by the court of the certified record provided by the administrative hearings bureau. Pending appeal, and subject to the bond requirement under subsection (18), the hearing officer may stay the order and any sanctions or costs imposed. Once an appeal is filed, and subject to the bond requirement under subsection (18), the court may stay the order and any sanctions or costs imposed. The court, as appropriate, may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision or order, or remand the matter for further proceedings. The court shall hold unlawful and set aside a decision or order of the hearing officer if substantial rights of an alleged violator have been prejudiced because the decision or order is any of the following:\n\n(a) In violation of the constitution or a statute, charter, or ordinance.\n\n(b) In excess of the authority or jurisdiction of the agency as conferred by statute, charter, or ordinance.\n\n(c) Made upon unlawful procedure resulting in material prejudice to a party.\n\n(d) Not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\n\n(e) Arbitrary, capricious, or clearly an abuse or unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(f) Affected by other substantial and material error of law.\n\n(20) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (21) or (22), if the civil fine and costs imposed against a person under this section are $1,000.00 or more and the person does not pay the civil fine and costs imposed within 30 days after a final decision and order of the hearing officer or of the circuit court under this section, the person is subject to the following:\n\n(a) For a first violation, the person is responsible for a state civil infraction and may be ordered to pay a civil fine of not more than $500.00.\n\n(b) For a second violation, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.\n\n(c) For a third or subsequent violation, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor and may be imprisoned for not more than 1 year and shall be fined $500.00.\n\n(21) Subsections (20) and (25) do not apply to any of the following that becomes the owner of a property after foreclosure or after taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure:\n\n(a) A government-sponsored enterprise. As used in this subdivision, \"government-sponsored enterprise\" means that term as defined in 2 USC 622(8), or the Michigan state housing development authority created under the state housing development authority act of 1966, 1966 PA 346, MCL 125.1401 to 125.1499c.\n\n(b) A financial institution.

Person includes the partners or members of a firm, a partnership, or an association and the officers of a corporation.\n\n(25) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (21) or (22), if a hearing officer or circuit court grants a final decision and order under this section finding a person in violation of a blight ordinance under subsection (4) and the person fails to correct the violation no later than 30 days after the final decision and order is granted, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days, a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.\n\nHistory:Add. 2003, Act 316, Imd.

The order shall not be recorded unless a legal description of the property is incorporated in or attached to the order. The lien is effective immediately upon recording of the order with the register of deeds.\n\n(2) An order recorded with a register of deeds under subsection (1) constitutes notice of the pendency of the lien. In addition, the city shall send a written notice of the lien by first-class mail to the owner of record of the land, building, or structure at the owner's last known address.\n\n(3) A lien under this section may be enforced and discharged by the city in the manner prescribed by its charter, in the same manner as are liens for delinquent taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, or by an ordinance duly passed by the governing body of the city. However, property that is exempt as a principal residence under section 7cc of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7cc, is not subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale under sections 78 to 79a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78 to 211.79a, for nonpayment of a civil fine or costs or an installment ordered under section 4q unless the property is also subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale under sections 78 to 79a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78 to 211.79a, for delinquent property taxes.\n\n(4) A lien created under this section has priority over any other lien unless 1 or more of the following apply:\n\n(a) The other lien is a lien for taxes or special assessments.\n\n(b) The other lien is created before May 1, 1994.\n\n(c) Federal law provides that the other lien has priority.\n\n(d) The other lien is recorded before the lien under this section is recorded.\n\n(5) A city may institute an action in circuit court for the collection of a judgment imposed by an order under section 4q for a blight violation. However, an attempt by the city to collect the judgment by any process does not invalidate or waive the lien upon the land, building, or structure.\n\n(6) A lien under this section expires 10 years after a copy of the order imposing a fine or costs, or both, is recorded, unless within that time an action to enforce the lien is commenced.\n\n(7) A default in the payment of a civil fine or costs under section 4q or an installment of the fine or costs may be collected by a means authorized for the enforcement of a court judgment under chapter 40 or 60 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.4001 to 600.4065, and MCL 600.6001 to 600.6098.\n\n(8) A city shall not commence an action to enforce a lien under this section if the city has commenced an action for a writ of garnishment with respect to the unpaid fine, costs, or payment under section 4027 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.4027.\n\nHistory:Add. 2003, Act 317, Imd.

Where a city submits to the electors a charter and the charter is adopted by the electors, and the city has operated under the charter, which charter has not, at the time it is adopted, been on file with the city clerk 60 days, then the legislative body of the city, upon its giving the notice of election as provided in the charter, may resubmit to the electors, at a special or general election, the charter, which, if adopted by the electors, shall be considered operative and effective as of the date of the first submission and adoption. The charter shall not be resubmitted unless 60 days have elapsed between the date of the filing of the charter and the date of the election at which the charter is resubmitted.\n\n(c) To call more than 2 special elections within 1 year. This prohibition does not apply to elections that may be held in the submission and resubmission of charters of cities that may be incorporated under this act until they have first adopted a charter, and does not apply to elections that may be held in the resubmission of a charter once adopted as provided in subdivision (b).\n\n(d) To decrease the salary of a municipal judge after his or her election or appointment, or during the judge's term of office, notwithstanding any charter provision to the contrary. The term of a public official shall not be shortened or extended beyond the period for which the official is elected or appointed, unless he or she resigns or is removed for cause, if the office is held for a fixed term.\n\n(e) To adopt a charter or an amendment to the charter unless approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question; to sell a park, cemetery, or any part of a park or cemetery, except where the park is not required under an official master plan of the city; to engage in a business enterprise requiring an investment of money in excess of 10 cents per capita; or to authorize an issue of bonds except bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes actually levied and uncollected or for which an appropriation has been made; bonds that the city is authorized by its charter to issue as part of its budget system, to an amount that in any year, together with the taxes levied for the same year, will not exceed the limit of taxation authorized by law; special assessment bonds; bonds for the city's portion of local improvements; refunding bonds; emergency bonds as defined by this act; and bonds that the legislative body is authorized by specific statute to issue without vote of the electors, unless approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question at a general or special election. In addition, a city that now has, or may subsequently have, a population of 750,000 persons or more may issue bonds, upon resolution of its governing body, without prior approval of the electors, which the city is authorized by its charter to issue as part of its budget system, to an amount that in any year, together with the ad valorem taxes levied for the same year, exclusive of debt service taxes or taxes levied pursuant to other laws, will not exceed 2-1/2% of the assessed value of the real and personal property in the city, this limitation to supersede and take the place of any contrary language in any existing city charter. For the purposes of this subdivision only, the assessed value of real and personal property in any city shall include the assessed value equivalent of money received during the city's fiscal year under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921. The assessed value equivalent shall be calculated by dividing the money received by the city's millage rate for the fiscal year. Notwithstanding the former provisions of this subdivision requiring approval by 3/5 of the electors voting on the question as a prerequisite to the exercise of certain powers, these powers may be exercised if approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question at a general or special election held on or after April 1, 1966.\n\n(f) To make a contract with, or give an official position to, one who is in default to the city.\n\n(g) To issue bonds without providing a sinking fund to pay them at maturity, except as provided in section 4g(1), but sinking funds shall not be required in the case of serial bonds that fall due annually. Bonds, whether authorized under this act or any other act, except refunding bonds, revenue bonds, motor vehicle highway fund bonds, rehabilitation bonds, judgment bonds, bonds or other obligations issued to fund an operating deficit of a city, bonds or other obligations to pay premiums or to establish funds to self-insure for losses as authorized by the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, bonds the issuance of which has been approved by the voters, and bonds issued to comply with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be issued by a city unless notice of the issuance of the bonds is published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 45 days before the issuance of the bonds, within which period a petition may be filed with the legislative body signed by not less than 10% or 15,000 of the registered electors in the city, whichever is less, in which event the legislative body shall submit the question of the issuance of the bonds to the electors of the city, at a regular or special election in the city. The bonds shall not be issued unless a majority vote of the electors voting on the issuance vote in favor of issuing the bonds. The notice of intent to issue bonds shall state the maximum amount of the bond issue, the purpose of the bond issuance, source of payment, right of referendum on the issuance of the bonds, and other information as the legislative body determines to be necessary to adequately inform the electors and all other interested persons of the nature of the issue and of their rights with respect to the issue.\n\n(h) To repudiate a debt by a change in its charter or by consolidation with any other municipality.\n\n(i) To submit a franchise to the electors at a special election, unless the expense of holding the election, as determined by the legislative body, is paid in advance to the city treasurer by the grantee in the franchise.\n\n(2) Beginning on the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, a city shall not adopt a city charter or ordinance that includes any minimum staffing requirement for city employees. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any provision in a city charter or ordinance adopted on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection that contains a minimum staffing requirement for city employees is void and unenforceable.\n\nHistory:1909, Act 279, Eff.

Energy conservation improvements may include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning system improvements, fenestration improvements, roof improvements, the installation of any insulation, the installation or repair of heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning controls, entrance or exit way closures, information technology improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement, and municipal utility improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement.\n\n(2) The legislative body of a city may acquire, finance, or refund 1 or more of the energy conservation improvements described in subsection (1) by installment contract, which may include a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or may borrow money and issue notes for the purpose of securing funds for the improvements or may enter into contracts in which the cost of the energy conservation improvements is paid from a portion of the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. These contractual agreements may provide that the cost of the energy conservation improvements are paid only if the energy savings are sufficient to cover their cost. An installment contract, a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall extend for a period of time not to exceed 20 years from the date of the final completion of the energy conservation improvements or the useful life of the aggregate energy conservation improvements, whichever is less. Notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall be full faith and credit, tax limited obligations of the city, payable from tax levies and the general fund as pledged by the legislative body of the city. The notes shall be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. A lease-purchase agreement issued pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, and shall not be a municipal security or a debt as those terms are defined in that act. This subsection does not limit in any manner the borrowing or bonding authority of a city as provided by law.\n\n(3) Prior to entering into a contract for energy conservation improvements under this section, the legislative body of a city shall determine the following information and, within 60 days of the completion of the improvements, shall report the following information to the Michigan public service commission:\n\n(a) Name of each facility to which an improvement is made and a description of the energy conservation improvement.\n\n(b) Actual energy consumption during the 12-month period before commencement of the improvement.\n\n(c) Project costs and expenditures, including the total of all lease payments over the duration of the lease-purchase agreement.\n\n(d) Estimated annual energy savings, including projected savings over the duration of the installment contract.\n\n(4) If energy conservation improvements are made as provided in this section, the legislative body of a city shall report to the Michigan public service commission, by July 1 of each of the 5 years after the improvements are completed, only the actual annual energy consumption of each facility to which improvements are made. The forms for the reports required by this section shall be furnished by the Michigan public service commission.\n\n(5) An installment contract described in this section may include a lease-purchase agreement, which may be a multiyear contractual obligation that provides for automatic renewal unless positive action is taken by the legislative body to terminate that contract. Payments under a lease-purchase agreement shall be a current operating expense subject to annual appropriations of funds by the legislative body and shall obligate the legislative body only for those sums payable during the fiscal year of contract execution or any renewal year thereafter. The legislative body may make payments under a lease-purchase agreement from any legally available funds or from a combination of energy or operational savings, capital contributions, future replacement costs avoided, or billable revenue enhancements that result from energy conservation improvements, provided that the legislative body has determined that those funds are sufficient to cover, in aggregate over the full term of the contractual agreement, the cost of the energy conservation improvements.

The commission is required to provide notice only to the property owners included on the list provided by the local unit of government as required under this section.\n\n(3) If an annexation is denied by the commission, the commission shall send a certified copy of its order to the clerk of each county, city, village, and township affected.\n\n(4) If an annexation is approved, and if on the date the petition or resolution was filed 100 persons or less resided in the area approved for annexation, the commission's order shall not be subject to a referendum. The commission shall send a certified copy of its order to the clerk of each county, city, village, and township affected and to the secretary of state. The annexation shall be effective on a date set forth in the commission's order.\n\n(5) If an annexation is approved, and if on the date the petition or resolution was filed more than 100 persons resided in the area approved for annexation, the commission shall send a certified copy of its order to the clerk of each county, city, village, and township affected and to the secretary of state. The commission's order shall become final 30 days after the date of the order unless within that 30 days a petition is filed with the commission which contains the signatures of at least 25% of the registered electors residing in the portion of the territory approved for annexation, in the annexing city or in the balance of the township. The commission after verifying the validity of any referendum petition shall order that a referendum on the question of annexation be held in each area from which a valid petition was filed. If a valid petition is not filed within the 30 days or if the majority of the electorate voting on the question in each area in which a referendum was held, voting separately, approve the annexation, the annexation shall be effective on a date set by order of the commission, otherwise the annexation shall not take effect.\n\n(6) The commission shall reject a petition or resolution for annexation of territory that includes all or any part of the territory which was described in any petition or resolution for annexation filed within the preceding 2 years and which was denied by the commission or was defeated in an election under subsection (5).\n\n(7) In addition to the methods for initiating annexation as provided in this act, a petition or resolution as follows may be submitted to the state boundary commission in a form and manner prescribed by the commission:\n\n(a) By resolution of the legislative body of the city to which the area is proposed to be annexed.\n\n(b) By petition by the persons, firms, corporations, the United States government, or the state or any of its subdivisions who collectively hold equitable title as a vendee under a recorded land contract or memorandum of land contract, or record title to 75% or more of the area of the land exclusive of streets in the territory proposed for annexation at the time of filing the petition.\n\n(c) By petition by 20% of the registered electors who reside in the area proposed for annexation.\n\n(8) Where the territory proposed to be annexed to any city is adjacent to the city and consists of a park or vacant property located in a township and owned by the city annexing the territory, and there is no one residing in the territory, the territory may be annexed to the city solely by resolution of the city council of the city. In any case where the territory proposed to be annexed is adjacent to the city and consists of property owned by the city or consists of fractional parts of platted subdivision lots, located in an adjoining city, village, or township, the annexation may also be accomplished by the majority vote of the legislative body of the city and the approval of the legislative body of the adjoining city, village, or township. As an alternate method, where there are no qualified electors residing in the territory proposed to be annexed to the city, other than the person or persons petitioning, a petition signed by a person or persons, firms, corporations, the United States government, or the state or any of its subdivisions who collectively hold the equitable title as a vendee under a recorded land contract or memorandum of land contract, or record legal title to more than 1/2 of the area of the land in the territory to be annexed is filed with the city council of the city and with the township board of the township in which the territory is situated, the annexation may be accomplished by the affirmative majority vote of the city council of the city and the approval of the township board of the township. At least 10 days prior to the approval by the township board, the township treasurer shall notify, personally or by registered mail with return receipt demanded, the owners of all real property in the territory to be annexed as shown on the assessment rolls of the township at the last known address on file with the township treasurer. Except as otherwise provided, this section shall not be construed to give any city the authority to attach territory from any other city unless the question relative to the territory has been voted upon by the voters of the entire cities affected where the territory proposed to be annexed is adjacent to a city and consists of property owned by the city or consists of fractional parts of platted subdivision lots, located in an adjoining city.\n\n(9) The provisions of section 14 shall not be applicable to an annexation approved by the commission of part of a township or village to a city except in the event of outstanding bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of the township or village. In such event, the commission shall determine and order an equitable division of assets and liabilities which relate to the bonds or other indebtedness.\n\n(10) The provisions of sections 8 and 8a shall not be applicable to petitions or resolutions filed with the state boundary commission.\n\n(11) After March 31, 1971, and so long as 1968 PA 191, MCL 123.1001 to 123.1020, is in effect, annexation of territory from a township or village to a home rule city shall be as provided in this section and no other means of annexation shall be effective.\n\n(12) The state boundary commission shall mail a copy of any final order issued under this section to each property owner the commission is required to provide notice to under subsection (2).\n\nHistory:1909, Act 279, Eff.

Upon receipt of any such petition by any county clerk, the board of supervisors of such county, the county clerk, and the clerks of the city and township or townships affected shall be governed by and do and perform all acts required to be performed by them by sections 8, 9, 10 and 12 of this act with respect to calling and holding an election upon the question petitioned for, the same as though the question were upon the annexation of a part of a city to a township, except that the electors of the city and of the township to be affected shall each vote separately, unless 2 or more townships are to be affected, in which case the votes cast in all such townships shall be cumulated and the result of the election on such question in such townships determined by the total vote therein which is cast for and against such question. In case a 2/3 majority of the qualified electors of such city shall vote in favor of the vacation of the incorporation of the same and a majority of the qualified electors of the township or townships to be affected shall vote in favor of the annexation of the territory of such city to such township or townships, the county clerk shall, within 30 days after the canvass of such votes, make and certify 4 transcripts of all the proceedings in the matter and shall file 2 of such transcripts in the office of the secretary of state and the other 2 copies in his own office, and, upon such filing, the incorporation of such city shall be vacated and the territory thereof annexed to the township or townships from which such territory was detached at the time of the incorporation thereof and by subsequent annexations. Upon the vacation of the incorporation of any city, it shall be the duty of the officers of such city forthwith to deposit all books, papers, records and files relating to the organization of, or belonging or pertaining to such city, which are in their custody as such officers with the county clerk of the county in which such city is located, for safekeeping and reference.

The city clerk of such city shall certify to the board of supervisors of the county in which such city is located a statement of all outstanding debt and other obligations at the time the incorporation of such city was vacated, together with an accounting of all moneys on hand for the payment of such debt and other obligations. Said board of supervisors shall proceed to examine the same and shall pass a resolution authorizing the disbursement of such moneys and the assessment and collection of taxes within the area which had comprised the city for the purpose of paying such debt and other obligations in accordance with the conditions set forth in any bond or other instrument by which such debt or other obligations were incurred or secured. Assets of the city which had been set aside at the time of dissolution of incorporation for the payment of the debt or other obligations of the city shall be transferred to the township treasurer of the township to which the territory of such city is annexed or to which the largest portion of such city is annexed and shall be applied by him to the payment of such debt and other obligations in accordance with the conditions in any bond or other instrument by which such funds were set aside or encumbered. Upon the vacation or discontinuance of any city incorporation, under the preceding sections, the indebtedness of such city, whether bonded or otherwise, if any there be, shall be assessed, levied and collected upon the territory embraced within the boundaries of such city immediately prior to such vacation. It shall be the duty of the supervisor or supervisors of the township or townships in which the territory formerly embraced within the limits of any vacated city within 1 year from the date of the vacation of such city, except when such indebtedness falls due at some specified time, in which case such assessment shall be made so as to meet such indebtedness when the same falls due, to levy upon the assessment roll or rolls of his township upon the property formerly embraced within the limits of such city, the indebtedness of such city, or such portion of the same as shall be apportioned to the part of the territory formerly constituting such city as lies within his township as hereinafter provided. The taxes so assessed and levied shall be collected the same as other taxes, and shall be placed in a separate fund and applied to the payment of such indebtedness and the manner of the payment of such indebtedness shall be fixed by the board of supervisors in the resolution to be passed by said board for such purpose. For the purpose of paying the debt and other obligations of the city, as herein provided, the area comprising the city, the incorporation of which is sought to be vacated, shall constitute a de facto city for the purpose of assessing, levying, and collecting the taxes required therefor as a city tax, subject to the tax limitation provisions of the charter of such city and of the general law applicable thereto, and not as a township tax, notwithstanding the fact that the same are levied and spread upon the assessment rolls of any township.\n\nHistory:Add. 1949, Act 220, Eff.

If the city and a third-party tax collector enter into an agreement providing for the direct payment of taxes to a trustee, a statutory lien and trust is created applicable to those tax revenues received or to be received from the third-party tax collector by the trustee. The tax revenues paid or to be paid to a trustee for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on the bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be subject to a lien and trust, which is a statutory lien and trust paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind, for the sole purpose of paying the principal of and interest on bonds issued pursuant to this section and any other bonds subsequently issued by the city sharing a parity or subordinate pledge of those tax revenues. The lien and trust created under this subsection for the benefit of bondholders or others is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The tax revenues held or to be held by a trustee shall be held in trust for the sole benefit of the holders of the bonds issued pursuant to this section and are exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the city other than for payment of debt service on the bonds to which the lien applies. As used in this subsection, \"third-party tax collector\" means a party that is not the city treasurer or other elected or appointed city official with whom the city has entered into a contractual agreement pursuant to which the third-party tax collector agrees to collect taxes that otherwise would be collected by the city treasurer.\n\n(7) A city that issues financial recovery bonds under this section subsequently may refund all or a portion of those bonds subject to the terms and conditions approved by the local emergency financial assistance loan board. However, the local emergency financial assistance loan board shall not approve any term or condition under this subsection that materially alters any existing term, condition, lien, or priority that applied to the bonds before the refunding if the approval would constitute an impermissible contract impairment. If financial recovery bonds are or have been issued by a city under this section, the city may provide additional security for the prior bonds pursuant to this subsection and may issue financial recovery bonds pursuant to this subsection to be sold to the Michigan finance authority for the purpose of refunding all or a portion of the prior bonds, or other obligations of the city, and for such other purposes as approved by the local emergency financial assistance loan board. A city may by resolution or order provide for the deposit of revenues pledged for the payment of prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection into a separate account for the purpose of paying principal and interest on those obligations, the administrative costs associated with those obligations, and any other obligations issued by the city that are secured by those revenues. For purposes of this subsection, principal and interest may include termination fees and credit enhancement fees, if any. If the city enters into an agreement with a third party that has a duty or obligation under the agreement or under state law to collect for, pay, remit, disburse, or distribute to the city all or a portion of the revenues pledged by the city for the payment of principal and interest on prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection, the agreement shall also provide for the direct payment of the revenues that the third party has a duty or obligation to collect for, pay, remit, disburse, or distribute to the city, and that the city has pledged for payment of the prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection, to a trustee to be deposited into a trust account and used for the sole purpose of paying principal of and interest on the prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection and related administrative costs and any other obligations issued by the city that are secured by those revenues. The agreement shall be authorized by resolution or order of the city and approved by the local emergency financial assistance loan board. If the city and a third party enter into an agreement providing for the direct payment of the revenues pledged by the city for the payment of prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection to a trustee, a statutory lien and trust is created applicable to those revenues received from the third party by the trustee, and the revenues paid to a trustee for the purpose of paying the principal and interest on prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to a lien and trust that is a statutory lien and trust paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind, for the sole purpose of paying the principal and interest on the prior bonds of the city or bonds of the city issued pursuant to this subsection and related administrative costs and any other obligations issued by the city that are secured by those revenues. The lien and trust created under this subsection is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The revenues held by a trustee pursuant to an agreement shall be held in trust pursuant to this subsection and are exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the city other than for payment of debt service on the obligations and related administrative costs to which the lien applies. A statutory lien and trust created by this subsection applicable to distributable aid received from the state treasurer by a paying agent, escrow agent, or trustee, shall apply only to the distributable aid, as that term is defined in section 9 of the fiscal stabilization act, 1981 PA 80, MCL 141.1009, after it has been appropriated and shall be subject to any subsequent reduction of that appropriation by operation of law or executive order. Nothing in this subsection shall abridge or reduce the ability of the state treasurer to withhold distributable aid from a city as provided by the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921. Financial recovery bonds issued pursuant to this subsection are not subject to subsection (4). This subsection shall not be construed to do any of the following:\n\n(a) Create or constitute state indebtedness.\n\n(b) Require the state to continue to impose and collect taxes from which distributable aid is paid or to make payments of distributable aid.\n\n(c) Limit or prohibit the state from repealing or amending a law enacted for the distributable aid, or for the manner, time, or amount of distributable aid.\n\n(8) If a city with a population of more than 600,000 that is located in a county organized under 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, issues or has issued financial recovery bonds pursuant to subsection (7), and the city, as a specified condition of the issuance, has entered into an agreement with a trustee for the deposit of revenues pledged by the city into a trust account as provided in subsection (7) that is established for the sole purpose of paying principal of and interest on those bonds and related administrative expenses, and the city has received the approval of the state treasurer, then, at all times after the issuance of the bonds and before the deposit of the revenues of the city into that trust account, the revenues of the city to be deposited are held in trust for the benefit of the trustee and the bonds by any party that comes into possession of the revenues. The revenues are held in trust for the benefit of the trustee and the bonds regardless of whether the city directly collects the revenues, a third party collects the revenues on the city's behalf, or any other person comes into possession of the revenues, and the revenues remain subject to the trust regardless of subsequent transfer or transfers of the revenues until such time as the revenues are deposited into that trust account. To the extent that the city or any other person holds a residual or other interest in the revenues held in trust and to be deposited with the trustee in the trust account, the interest is subordinate to a lien in the revenues in favor of the trustee for the purpose of ensuring delivery of the revenues to the trust account. This lien arises by operation of law and without further act or notice of any kind at the earliest time that the city has or acquires any rights in the revenues pledged pursuant to the agreement, is and will remain paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind, and is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The revenues held in trust and to be deposited into the trust account pursuant to this subsection are exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the city other than those expressly specified in the agreement described in this subsection and subsection (7).\n\n(9) Financial recovery bonds issued under this section are not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.\n\nHistory:Add. 2003, Act 210, Imd.
