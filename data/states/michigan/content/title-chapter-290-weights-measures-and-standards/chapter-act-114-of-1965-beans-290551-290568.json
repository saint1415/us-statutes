If a majority of the growers voting who represent a majority of the hundredweight sold in any 1 of the previous 3 years of those voting, vote against having the commission continue to function, the commission shall cease its operations and deliver its assets to the director who shall transfer the assets to Michigan state university for bean research. A grower is entitled to 1 vote and the grower must be able to verify the hundredweight claimed as being sold as indicated on the ballot.\n\n(2) Upon written petition signed by at least 200 growers but with not more than 100 of them from any 1 district, the director shall, within 30 days, give 10 days' notice and hold a hearing on termination of the commission. Within 45 days after the close of the hearings, the director shall conduct a referendum to determine whether the growers assent to the proposed action. The commission is terminated if a majority by number of those voting, representing a majority of the hundredweight sold in any 1 of the previous 3 years of those voting, vote against its continuation. The commission shall then cease its operations and deliver its assets to the director who shall transfer the assets to Michigan state university for bean research. A referendum described in this subsection shall not be conducted within 1 year before or after any other referendum. A grower is entitled to 1 vote and the grower must be able to verify the hundredweight claimed as being sold as indicated on the ballot.\n\n(3) Not less than 30 days before the referendum required by subsection (1), the department of agriculture shall submit for review the ballot to be used in conducting the referendum to the senate's and the house of representatives' standing committees dealing primarily with agricultural issues.\n\nHistory:1965, Act 114, Eff.
