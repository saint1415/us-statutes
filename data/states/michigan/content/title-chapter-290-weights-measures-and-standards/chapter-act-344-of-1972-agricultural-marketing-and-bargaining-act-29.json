This offer shall be made in writing to the accredited association at least 7 days prior to the start of the marketing period. A copy of this offer shall be sent by registered mail to the department. The accredited association may file a claim for relief with the department if it feels that the offer is unreasonable.

Within 15 days following the start of the marketing period for the agricultural commodity, the department shall establish a joint settlement committee to arbitrate the issues in dispute.\n\n(4) The joint settlement committee consists of 1 committee member selected by the association, 1 committee member selected by the handler, and 1 committee member selected by the committee members representing the association and the handler. This third committee member shall be chairperson of the committee. If the third committee member cannot be agreed upon by the association and the handler committee members, the department shall submit a list composed of the names of 5 persons knowledgable in the marketing of the agricultural commodity from which the third committee member shall be chosen. The selection shall be made by the association representative and the handler representative each striking 2 different names from the list. The remaining name shall be the person who serves as the third committee member and as its chairperson. The order of striking shall be determined by chance.\n\nHistory:1972, Act 344, Eff.
