      "text": "No person, firm or corporation, by himself, his servant or his agent, or as the servant or agent of any other person, firm or corporation, shall manufacture or mix for sale, sell, offer or expose for sale, or have in his possession with intent to sell in this state, under the name of raw linseed oil or raw flaxseed oil, any substance which is not wholly the product obtained from well cleaned flaxseed or linseed, and unless the aforesaid oil also fulfills the requirements of the 1900 edition of the Pharmacopoeia of the United States, which follow:\n\n1. Specific gravity 0.925 to 0.935 at 25 deg. C. (77 deg. F.). It does not congeal at temperatures above 20 deg. C. (4 deg. F.). It is soluble in about 10 parts of absolute alcohol and in all proportions in ether, chloroform, petroleum, benzine, carbon disulphide and oil of turpentine. It should not more than slightly redden blue litmus paper, previously moistened with alcohol (limit of free acid). The oil should be completely saponifiable with alcoholic potassium hydroxide T.S. and the resulting soap should be completely soluble in water without leaving an oily residue, (absence of mineral oils and rosin oils). If 2 CC. of the oil be warmed and shaken in a test tube with an equal volume of glacial acetic acid, and if to this mixture, after cooling, 1 drop of sulphuric acid be added, a greenish color should be produced. (A violet color under these circumstances indicates the presence of rosin oils). Linseed oil saponified by alcoholic potassium hydroxide T.S. should show a saponification value of from 187 to 195. If 0.15 CC. of linseed oil be dissolved in 10 CC. of chloroform in a 250 CC. flask and 25 CC. of a mixture of equal volume of alcoholic iodine T.S. and alcoholic mercuric chloride T.S. added, and if, after standing for 16 hours, protected from the light, 20 CC. potassium iodide T.S. be introduced and the mixture diluted with 50 CC. of water, on titrating the excess of iodine with tenth normal sodium thiosulphate V.S. an iodine value of not less than 170 should be obtained. No person, firm or corporation, by himself, his servant or his agent, or as the servant or agent of any other person, firm or corporation, shall manufacture or mix for sale, sell, offer or expose for sale or have in his possession with intent to sell in this state, any substance as boiled linseed oil or as boiled flaxseed oil, unless the same shall have been prepared by heating raw linseed oil, as defined above: Provided, That if drier is used in said boiled linseed oil or boiled flaxseed oil, the same shall have been prepared by incorporating said drier with raw linseed oil, as defined above, at a temperature of not less than 225 deg. Fahrenheit, and furthermore contains not less than 96 per cent of linseed oil; and for the purpose of this act it shall also be deemed a violation thereof if said boiled linseed oil prepared either with or without drier does not conform to the following requirements: 1. Its specific gravity at 60 deg. Fahrenheit must be not less than 0.935 and not greater than 0.945; 2. Its saponification value (Koettstorfer figure) must not be less than 186; 3. Its iodine number (Huebl's method) must be not less than 160; 4. Its acid value must not exceed 10; 5. The volatile matter expelled at 212 deg. Fahrenheit must not exceed 1/2 of 1 per cent; 6. No mineral oil shall be present and the amount of unsaponifiable matter as determined by standard methods shall not exceed 2.5 per cent; 7. The film left after flowing the oil over glass and allowing it to drain in a vertical or nearly vertical position must dry free from tackiness in not to exceed 20 hours, at a temperature of about 70 deg. Fahrenheit. Linseed oil or flaxseed oil which does not conform to the foregoing requirements shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of this act.\n\nHistory:1909, Act 110, Eff.
