A district area shall not be designated unless the local legislative body first holds a public hearing on the designation. The legislative body shall give notice of the public hearing not less than 20 nor more than 30 days before the date for the public hearing.\n\n(5) Citizens' district councils are governed by the following:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, for each district area, a citizens' district council of not less than 12 nor more than 25 members shall be selected in a manner that ensures that the citizens' district council is to the maximum extent possible representative of the residents of the area and of other persons with a demonstrable and substantial interest in the area.

For purposes of this notice it shall be sufficient to describe the boundaries of the development area by its location in relation to highways, streets, streams, or otherwise. The notice shall further contain a statement that maps, plats, and a particular description of the development plan, including the method of relocating families and individuals who will be displaced from the area, are available for public inspection at a place to be designated in the notice, and that all aspects of the development plan will be open for discussion at the public hearing.\n\n(b) At the time set for hearing the local legislative body shall provide an opportunity for all persons interested to be heard and shall receive and consider communications in writing with reference to the development plan. The hearing shall provide the fullest opportunity for expression of opinion, for argument on the merits of the development plan, and for introduction of documentary evidence pertinent to the development plan.\n\n(c) The local legislative body shall make and preserve a record of the public hearing, including specific findings of fact with respect to its determination of the blighted area and its determination that there is a feasible method for relocation of families and individuals who will be displaced from the area, all data presented at the public hearing and all other data which the legislative body considered in making its determinations. If no individuals reside in the development area, the legislative body is not required to determine a feasible method for relocating residents.\n\n(12) Within 10 days after the completion of the public hearing as provided in subsection (11), the citizens' district council for the district within which the proposed development area is located shall notify the local legislative body in writing of its approval or disapproval of the development plan. If the citizens' district council approves the plan or fails to notify the local legislative body of its approval or disapproval of the plan, the local legislative body is free to act on the plan. If the citizens' district council disapproves the plan and so notifies in writing the local legislative body, the local legislative body shall not adopt the plan for at least 30 days after receipt of the notice and during that period shall consult with the citizens' district council concerning its objections.\n\nHistory:1945, Act 344, Imd.

The legislative body in the resolution authorizing issuance of the bonds shall set forth the estimate or the bonds may be issued when any project has been completed. Bonds issued under this section shall be designated \"rehabilitation bonds\". All bonds issued under this section are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. It being the determination of this legislature that urban blight constitutes a serious menace to public health, welfare, and safety of municipalities and their inhabitants and that the financing of projects designed to prevent or eliminate urban blight is necessary for the public health, welfare, and safety, the bonds authorized to be issued under this section are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose. The maximum principal amount of bonds that may be authorized under this section in any year shall not exceed an amount equal to 5% of the assessed value of the real and personal property in the municipality less the taxes actually levied for the year exclusive of debt service tax levies and taxes levied under other laws, and less budget bonds authorized for the year issued or authorized to be issued and less any bonds authorized in the year to be issued under sections 6a and 6b of 1949 PA 208, MCL 125.946a and 125.946b. For the purposes of this section, the assessed value of real and personal property in the municipality shall include the assessed value equivalent of money received during the municipality's fiscal year under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921. All actions previously taken by a municipality authorizing the issuance of bonds and all bonds previously issued by a municipality are validated. Any bonds authorized to be issued under this section shall be sold not later than 3 full fiscal years from the end of the fiscal year in which the bonds are authorized to be issued. The maximum amount of bonds issued under this section that may be outstanding at any one time shall not, together with other outstanding indebtedness of the municipality, exceed the maximum limitations on bonded indebtedness of the municipality imposed by law.\n\n(4) Except as otherwise provided in this act, the bonds shall not be subject to the provisions of any other law or charter provision relating to their issuance or sale.\n\n(5) The legislative body of any municipality issuing bonds under this section in the resolution authorizing issuance of the bonds shall estimate the period of usefulness of the planned improvements to be installed in the development area after the project is completed.\n\nHistory:Add. 1957, Act 296, Eff.
