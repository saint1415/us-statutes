This subsection does not require the increase of any payment in lieu of taxes previously agreed to by the incorporating unit.\n\n(3) For purposes of this section, \"qualified entity\" means either of the following:\n\n(a) A Michigan nonprofit corporation or a Michigan limited partnership having a Michigan nonprofit corporation as its sole general partner, if 1 of the following applies:\n\n(i) The nonprofit corporation is owned by the commission.\n\n(ii) A majority of the members of the board of directors of the nonprofit corporation are elected and removable by the commission.\n\n(iii) The commission is the sole member of the nonprofit corporation.\n\n(b) A for-profit corporation, partnership, or company formed or incorporated by the commission for the sole purpose of syndicating low income housing tax credits in connection with the redevelopment of a housing project that has been owned by the commission, if the commission maintains oversight responsibility for the management and operation of the project for which low income housing tax credits were syndicated and the for-profit entity does not engage in any other business activity unrelated to the housing project.\n\nHistory:Add. 1996, Act 338, Imd.
