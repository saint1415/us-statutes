The authority and powers conferred by this act, including the powers conferred with respect to the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, enlarging, remodeling, improving, repairing, operation, and maintenance of pollution control facilities and the financing thereof whether by purchase, sale, lease, or otherwise, including pollution control facilities heretofore acquired, under construction, placed in operation, or completed by any person, firm, corporation, or public utility, and the issuance of bonds for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds, constitutes such a necessary program and serves a valid public purpose. A municipality may do any or all of the following:\n\n(a) Construct, acquire by gift or purchase, reconstruct, improve, enlarge, maintain, remodel, repair, or operate and maintain any pollution control facilities or portion thereof within or without the municipality whether the pollution control facilities have been or are operating, are under construction, or are completed.

An agreement may provide for conveyance of the pollution control facilities to the lessee or purchaser under the agreement after provision has been made for the retirement in full of all bonds issued therefor under terms and conditions provided in the agreement or, with respect to pollution control facilities leased or sold to a public utility, at any time where the obligation of the lessee or purchaser to make the payments prescribed by the preceding sentence of this subdivision shall remain fixed as therein provided notwithstanding the conveyance.

The commission or its successor agency may request the municipality to furnish such information as the commission or its successor agency deems necessary in order to pass on the application. Unless an exception from prior approval is available pursuant to subsection (3), bonds shall not be issued until the municipal finance commission or its successor agency approves the issuance. In determining whether a proposed issue of bonds shall be approved, the municipal finance commission or its successor agency shall take into consideration: (a) whether the bonds conform to the provisions of this act; (b) whether the probable revenues pledged to the payment of the bonds will be sufficient to pay the principal and interest when due; and (c) whether the amount of the proposed issue is sufficient or excessive for the purpose for which they are to be issued.\n\n(2) No order of the municipal finance commission or its successor agency permitting the issuance of bonds under this act shall be deemed an approval of the legality thereof. The issuance of the commission's or its successor agency's order granting permission to issue the bonds shall imply that the commission or its successor agency has made such determination of facts or circumstances, has given such approvals and has reached such opinions as are a necessary prerequisite to the issuance of the order.\n\n(3) The requirement of subsection (1) for obtaining the prior approval of the municipal finance commission or its successor agency before issuing bonds under this act shall be subject to sections 10 and 11 of chapter III of Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943, being sections 133.10 and 133.11 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and the department of treasury shall have the same authority as provided by section 11 of chapter III of Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943 to issue an order providing or denying an exception from the prior approval required by subsection (1) for bonds issued under this act.\n\nHistory:1963, Act 62, Imd.
