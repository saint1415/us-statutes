The state transportation department shall prescribe standards of slope gradient, width, and slip-resistant qualities that will assure that a sidewalk accommodates a person in a wheelchair or other persons with physical disabilities. All agencies of state and local government including school districts and other groups aforementioned, public or private, shall comply with these standards and this act when undertaking construction or reconstruction of affected streets, curbs, or sidewalks, except that a local unit of government may adopt ordinances that provide for standards at least equal to those provided by the state transportation department.\n\nHistory:1973, Act 8, Imd.
