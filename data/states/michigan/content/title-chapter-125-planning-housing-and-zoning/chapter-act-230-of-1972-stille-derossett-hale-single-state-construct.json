If a performance evaluation is to be conducted upon the receipt of a written complaint, the director shall first refer the written complaint to the affected enforcing agency requesting a written response within 10 days. If the local enforcing agency fails to provide a written response, or if the response is considered inadequate, the director shall consult with the commission and request approval to conduct the performance evaluation. The director shall submit a written recommendation to the commission and shall send a copy to the affected enforcing agency, along with a reasonable notice of the commission meeting at which the recommendation will be presented. The decision of the commission to proceed with a performance evaluation shall be made at a public meeting. This decision shall be mailed to the enforcing agency 10 days in advance of conducting the performance evaluation.\n\n(2) When conducting a performance evaluation of an enforcing agency, the director may request that the local enforcing agency accompany the director or other state inspectors on inspections. The inspections shall be for the enforcement of this act and the code. The enforcing agency shall maintain all official records and documents relating to applications for permits, inspection records including correction notices, orders to stop construction, and certificates of use and occupancy. The enforcing agency shall make available for review all official records between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on business days.\n\n(3) Upon completion of a performance evaluation, the director shall report the findings and any recommendations to the commission and the local enforcing agency.

A structure commenced under an effective code shall be completed under that code.\n\n(4) If an enforcing agency or the chief elected official of the governmental subdivision transmits an appeal of the notice of intent to withdraw the responsibility issued under subsection (3), the commission chairperson shall request appointment of a hearings officer. The hearings officer shall conduct a hearing of the appeal pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, and issue a proposed decision which shall be sent to the affected parties. The proposed decision shall become the final order issued by the commission, unless exceptions are filed by a party within 30 days after receipt of the proposed decision. The commission shall review the proposed decision when exceptions are filed.\n\n(5) The commission in reviewing a proposed decision may affirm, modify, reverse, or remand the proposed decision. When the commission affirms, modifies, reverses, or remands a proposed decision, the decision of the commission shall be in writing and contain the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which its decision is based.

The department may require that the manufacturer submit test results on the premanufactured unit or its components, any material or information the department considers relevant, or 1 or more of the premanufactured units for testing and evaluation by the department.\n\n(3) Each premanufactured unit shall be inspected by the department, or a qualified person approved by the department, to determine that the premanufactured unit has been manufactured in accordance with plans and specifications submitted under subsection (2). The department may issue a certificate of acceptability for a premanufactured unit that bears the approved label of an independent, nationally recognized body having follow-up inspection service satisfactory to the commission, certifying that the premanufactured unit complies with plans and specifications submitted under subsection (2).\n\n(4) Plans and specifications for 1- and 2-family dwelling premanufactured units may be reviewed by the department or by an independent entity approved by the commission under rules promulgated by the department.

However, the manufacturer may request a variance from the commission if the literal application of the requirements of this section would result in an exceptional, practical difficulty relating to inspection of specific units.
