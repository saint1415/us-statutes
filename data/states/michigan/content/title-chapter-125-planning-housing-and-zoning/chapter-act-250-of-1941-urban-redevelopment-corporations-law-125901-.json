In arriving at such determination, the planning commission shall consider only those elements of the development plan relevant to such determination under subparagraphs (a) through (g) of this paragraph 3 of section 4 and to the type of development which is physically desirable for the development area concerned from a city planning viewpoint, and from a neighborhood unit viewpoint if the development plan provides that the development area is to be primarily residential. Upon approval of a development plan by the planning commission, it shall forthwith issue a certificate of approval thereof.\n\nA planning commission may state general standards of city and neighborhood unit planning to which a development plan should conform to be approved by it. Such standards, however, shall be as flexible as possible and only for the guidance of prospective proponents of development plans.

Upon approval of a development plan by the supervising agency, it shall forthwith issue a certificate of approval thereof.\n\n5. The planning commission and the supervising agency may approve an amendment or amendments to a development plan, but no such amendment to a development plan which has theretofore been approved by the planning commission and the supervising agency shall be approved unless and until an application therefor has been filed with the planning commission or the supervising agency by the redevelopment corporation containing that part of the material required by paragraph 1 of this section 4 which shall be relevant to the proposed amendment, and unless and until the planning commission or the supervising agency, as the case may be, shall make the determinations required by paragraph 3 or 4 of this section 4 which shall be relevant to the proposed amendment.\n\n6. The planning commission and the supervising agency may each adopt a schedule of fees to be paid upon the filing of the development plan, amendments thereto and other instruments in connection therewith.
