Property exempt from taxation at the time the initial taxable value is determined is included with the initial taxable value of zero. Property for which a specific tax is paid in lieu of property tax is not considered exempt from taxation. The state tax commission shall prescribe the method for calculating the initial taxable value of property for which a specific tax was paid in lieu of property tax.

      "text": "(1) Subject to the approval of the governing body and Michigan strategic fund under section 14a, the board may implement a transformational brownfield plan. The transformational brownfield plan may consist of a single development on eligible property or a series of developments on eligible property that are part of a related program of investment, whether or not located on contiguous parcels, and may be amended to apply to additional parcels of eligible property. Each amendment to a transformational brownfield plan must be approved by the governing body of the municipality in which it is located and the Michigan strategic fund and must be consistent with the approval requirements in this section.\n\n(2) A transformational brownfield plan may authorize the use of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, tax increment revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for eligible activities described in section 2(o)(v). Except as otherwise provided in section 13b(6)(d), tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues must be used only for the costs of eligible activities included within the transformational brownfield plan to which the revenues are attributable, including the cost of principal of and interest on any obligation to pay the cost of the eligible activities.\n\n(3) A transformational brownfield plan is a brownfield plan and, except as otherwise provided, is subject to sections 13, 13a, 13b, 14, and 15. In addition to the information required under section 13(2), a transformational brownfield plan must contain all of the following:\n\n(a) The basis for designating the plan as a transformational brownfield plan under section 2(hhh).\n\n(b) A description of the costs of the transformational brownfield plan intended to be paid for with construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues.\n\n(c) An estimate of the amount of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues expected to be generated for each year of the transformational brownfield plan from the eligible property.\n\n(d) The beginning date and duration of capture of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for each eligible property as determined under subsections (8) and (11).\n\n(4) Subject to section 14a(7), the transformational brownfield plan may provide for the use of part or all of the tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues. The portion of tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues to be used may vary over the duration of the transformational brownfield plan, but the portion intended to be used must be clearly stated in the transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(5) Approval of a transformational brownfield plan, or an amendment to a transformational brownfield plan, must be in accordance with the notice, approval, and public hearing requirements of sections 14 and 14a, except that the governing body shall provide notice to the Michigan strategic fund not less than 30 days before the hearing on a transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(6) If a transformational brownfield plan authorizes the use of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues, approval of a combined brownfield plan or work plan by the Michigan strategic fund and a written development or reimbursement agreement between the owner or developer of the eligible property, the authority, and the Michigan strategic fund are required. If a plan authorizes the use of tax increment revenues for eligible activities under section 2(o)(v) other than eligible activities described in section 13b, approval of a work plan or combined brownfield plan by the Michigan strategic fund to use tax increment revenues for those additional eligible activities is required. A work plan or combined brownfield plan under this subsection must be consolidated with a work plan or combined brownfield plan under section 13b(4). The eligible activities to be conducted must be consistent with the work plan submitted by the authority to the Michigan strategic fund.\n\n(7) On approval of the transformational brownfield plan by the governing body and Michigan strategic fund, and the execution of the written development or reimbursement agreement, the transfer and distribution of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues as specified in this act and in the plan are binding on this state and the collection and transmission of the amount of tax increment revenues as specified in this act and in the plan are binding on all taxing units levying ad valorem property taxes or specific taxes against property subject to the transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(8) A transformational brownfield plan must not authorize the capture or use of tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues after the year in which the total amount of the revenue captured under the transformational brownfield plan is equal to the sum of the costs permitted to be funded with the revenue under the transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(9) The brownfield authority and Michigan strategic fund may reimburse advances, with or without interest, made by a municipality under section 7(3), a land bank fast track authority, or any other person or entity for costs of eligible activities included within a transformational brownfield plan using tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues attributable to that plan. On approval of the Michigan strategic fund, the amount of tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues authorized to be captured under a transformational brownfield plan may include amounts required for the payment of interest under this subsection. A written development or reimbursement agreement must be entered into under subsection (6) before any reimbursement or payment using tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues may commence. A reimbursement agreement for these purposes and the obligations under that reimbursement agreement are not subject to section 12 or the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.\n\n(10) Eligible activities conducted on eligible property before approval of the transformational brownfield plan may be reimbursed from tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues if those costs and the eligible property are subsequently included in a transformational brownfield plan approved by the governing body and Michigan strategic fund, a combined brownfield plan or work plan approved by the Michigan strategic fund, and a written development or reimbursement agreement under subsection (6). Reimbursement under this subsection is limited to eligible expenses incurred within 90 days of the approval of the transformational brownfield plan by the Michigan strategic fund.\n\n(11) The duration of the capture of withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues under a transformational brownfield plan for a particular eligible property must not exceed the lesser of the period authorized under subsection (8) or 20 years from the beginning date of the capture of withholding tax capture revenues income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for that eligible property. The beginning date for the capture of tax increment revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for an eligible property must not be later than 5 years following the date the Michigan strategic fund approves the inclusion of the eligible property in a transformational brownfield plan. Subject to the approval of the governing body and Michigan strategic fund, the authority may amend the beginning date of capture of tax increment revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues to a date not later than 5 years following the date the Michigan strategic fund approved inclusion of the eligible property in the transformational brownfield plan if capture of the revenues under the transformational brownfield plan has not yet commenced. Solely with respect to a related program of investment as defined in subsection (12), subject to the approval of the governing body and Michigan strategic fund, the authority may amend the beginning date of capture of tax increment revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for an eligible property included within a related program of investment to a date later than 5 years following the date the Michigan strategic fund approved inclusion of the eligible property in the transformational brownfield plan if the governing body and Michigan strategic fund determine that the developer of the related program of investment has proceeded in good faith and made reasonable and substantial progress in the implementation of the related program of investment.\n\n(12) For purposes of subsection (1), a series of developments on parcels that are not contiguous is considered a related program of investment if all of the following are met:\n\n(a) The developments are proposed to be undertaken concurrently or in reasonable succession.\n\n(b) For developments under affiliated ownership, the developments are reasonably contiguous and are part of a program of investment in a logically defined geography, including, but not limited to, a downtown district as defined in section 201 of the recodified tax increment financing act, 2018 PA 57, MCL 125.4201, or a principal shopping district or business improvement district as defined in section 1 of 1961 PA 120, MCL 125.981, and including areas that are logically related to those districts and that will promote infill development.\n\n(c) For developments under unrelated ownership, in addition to the criteria described in subdivisions (a) and (b), the developments are part of a master development plan, area plan, sub-area plan, or similar development plan that has been approved or adopted by resolution of the governing body.\n\n(d) The designation of the developments as a related program of investment is consistent with the purposes of this act and is not a combination of unrelated or minimally related projects calculated to meet the minimum investment threshold.\n\n(13) If undeveloped property included in a transformational brownfield plan has been designated as a renaissance zone under the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, on the request of the owner or developer of the eligible property and the local governmental unit that designated the zone, the Michigan strategic fund, and a city levying a tax under the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.501 to 141.787, may elect under section 9(4) of the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2689, to terminate the exemptions, deductions, or credits provided for in section 9(1)(b) and (c) of that act, and reimburse the authority, or owner or developer of the eligible property, an annual amount equal to the revenue collected for each tax year as a result of the termination of the exemptions, deductions, or credits that would otherwise be in effect. In implementing this subsection, all of the following apply:\n\n(a) The authority and Michigan strategic fund shall include amounts anticipated to be collected under this subsection in the income tax capture revenues authorized to be used under the transformational brownfield plan and associated work plan or combined brownfield plan.\n\n(b) The state treasurer shall calculate for each tax year the amount of revenue this state collected as a result of the operation of this subsection and shall deposit that amount as income tax capture revenues into the state brownfield redevelopment fund, where the funds must be transmitted in the manner provided for in sections 8a(4) and 16(8).\n\n(c) A city levying a city income tax under the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.501 to 141.787, shall calculate for each tax year the amount of revenue the city collected as a result of the operation of this subsection and shall enter into a binding reimbursement agreement with the authority, and owner or developer of the eligible property, providing for the payment of the amounts to the authority, or the owner or developer of the eligible property, for eligible activities as provided in the transformational brownfield plan. City income taxes administered by the department of treasury pursuant to the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.501 to 141.787, are subject to the procedures of subdivision (b) regarding the calculation and deposit of any revenue collected as a result of the operation of this subsection.\n\n(d) The department of treasury may require the owner or developer to submit any information necessary for the calculation of revenue collected pursuant to the operation of this subsection. This state has no obligation for calculating revenues to be collected pursuant to the operation of this subsection if the required information is not reported.\n\n(14) The authority and governing body are solely responsible for deciding whether to seek approval of a brownfield plan as a transformational brownfield plan. Nothing in this section or section 14a operates to prejudice or limit consideration of a brownfield plan under sections 13 and 14, including a decision by the Michigan strategic fund not to approve a plan as a transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(15) This act does not preclude an authority established by a county from seeking approval of a brownfield plan as a transformational brownfield plan. In the event that an authority established by a county seeks approval of a plan that extends into more than 1 of its component local units of government and that plan includes eligible property in more than 1 municipality that is not a county, the minimum investment requirements of section 2(hhh) must be established with reference to combined population of the municipalities that are not a county in which the eligible property is located.\n\nHistory:Add. 2017, Act 46, Eff.

      "text": "(1) Before approving a brownfield plan for an eligible property, the governing body shall hold a public hearing on the brownfield plan. By resolution, the governing body may delegate the public hearing process to the authority or to a subcommittee of the governing body subject to final approval by the governing body.\n\n(2) Notice of the time and place of the hearing on a brownfield plan must contain all of the following:\n\n(a) A description of the property to which the plan applies in relation to existing or proposed highways, streets, streams, or otherwise.\n\n(b) A statement that maps, plats, and a description of the brownfield plan are available for public inspection at a place designated in the notice and that all aspects of the brownfield plan are open for discussion at the public hearing required by this section.\n\n(c) Any other information that the governing body considers appropriate.\n\n(3) At the time set for the hearing on the brownfield plan required under subsection (1), the governing body shall ensure that interested persons have an opportunity to be heard and that written communications with reference to the brownfield plan are received and considered. The governing body shall ensure that a record of the public hearing is made and preserved, including all data presented at the hearing.\n\n(4) Not less than 10 days before the hearing on the brownfield plan, the governing body shall provide notice of the hearing to the taxing jurisdictions that levy taxes subject to capture under this act. The authority shall notify the taxing jurisdictions of the proposed brownfield plan. At that hearing, an official from a taxing jurisdiction with millage that would be subject to capture under this act has the right to be heard in regard to the adoption of the brownfield plan. Not less than 10 days before the hearing on the brownfield plan, the governing body shall provide notice of the hearing to the department if the brownfield plan involves the use of taxes levied for school operating purposes to pay for eligible activities that require the approval of a combined brownfield plan or a work plan by the department under section 13b(6)(c), the Michigan state housing development authority, or its designee, if the brownfield plan involves the use of taxes levied for school operating purposes to pay for eligible activities subject to 13b(4)(b), and the Michigan strategic fund, or its designee, if the brownfield plan involves the use of taxes levied for school operating purposes to pay for eligible activities subject to section 13b(4) other than eligible activities subject to 13b(4)(b).\n\n(5) Not less than 10 days after notice of the proposed brownfield plan is provided to the taxing jurisdictions, the governing body shall determine whether the plan constitutes a public purpose. If the governing body determines that the plan does not constitute a public purpose, the governing body shall reject the plan. If the governing body determines that the plan constitutes a public purpose, the governing body may then approve or reject the plan, or approve it with modification, by resolution, based on the following considerations:\n\n(a) Whether the plan meets the requirements of sections 13 and 13b.\n\n(b) Whether the proposed method of financing the costs of eligible activities is feasible and the authority has the ability to arrange the financing.\n\n(c) Whether the costs of eligible activities proposed are reasonable and necessary to carry out the purposes of this act.\n\n(d) Whether the amount of captured taxable value estimated to result from adoption of the plan is reasonable.\n\n(6) Except as provided in this subsection, amendments to an approved brownfield plan must be submitted by the authority to the governing body for approval or rejection following the same notice necessary for approval or rejection of the original plan. Notice is not required for revisions in the estimates of captured taxable value or tax increment revenues.\n\n(7) The procedure, adequacy of notice, and findings with respect to purpose and captured taxable value are presumptively valid unless contested in a court of competent jurisdiction within 60 days after adoption of the resolution adopting the brownfield plan. An amendment, adopted by resolution, to a conclusive plan is likewise conclusive unless contested within 60 days after adoption of the resolution adopting the amendment. If a resolution adopting an amendment to the plan is contested, the original resolution adopting the plan is not therefore open to contest.\n\n(8) A brownfield plan or plan amendment may be abolished or terminated according to this subsection subject to all of the following:\n\n(a) The governing body may abolish a brownfield plan if it finds that the purposes for which the plan was established are accomplished.\n\n(b) The governing body may terminate a brownfield plan or plan amendment for an eligible property if the project for which eligible activities were identified in the brownfield plan or plan amendment fails to occur with respect to the eligible property for not less than 2 years following the date of the resolution approving the brownfield plan or plan amendment, if the governing body first does both of the following:\n\n(i) Gives 30 days' prior written notice to the developer at its last known address by certified mail or other method that documents proof of delivery attempted.\n\n(ii) Provides the developer an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.\n\n(c) If a brownfield plan or plan amendment is terminated under subdivision (b), the governing body may approve a new brownfield plan or plan amendment for the eligible property under which tax increment revenues may be captured for up to the period of time provided under section 13(5).\n\n(d) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the contrary, a brownfield plan or plan amendment must not be abolished or terminated until the principal and interest on bonds issued under section 17 and all other obligations to which the tax increment revenues are pledged have been paid or funds sufficient to make the payment have been identified or segregated.\n\nHistory:1996, Act 381, Eff.

      "text": "(1) The governing body and Michigan strategic fund shall determine whether to approve a transformational brownfield plan in accordance with this section.\n\n(2) The governing body shall make an initial determination as to whether the transformational brownfield plan constitutes a public purpose in accordance with section 14(5). If the governing body determines the transformational brownfield plan does not constitute a public purpose, it shall reject the transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(3) If the governing body determines that the transformational brownfield plan constitutes a public purpose, the governing body may then approve or reject the transformational brownfield plan, or approve it with modification, by resolution based on all of the following considerations:\n\n(a) Whether the transformational brownfield plan meets the requirements of section 2(hhh), which must include a determination that the transformational brownfield plan is calculated to, and has the reasonable likelihood to, have a transformational impact on local economic development and community revitalization based on the extent of brownfield redevelopment and growth in population, commercial activity, and employment that will result from the transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(b) Whether the transformational brownfield plan meets the requirements of sections 13, 13b, and 13c.\n\n(c) Whether the costs of eligible activities proposed are reasonable and necessary to carry out the purposes of this act.\n\n(d) Whether the amount of captured taxable value, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues estimated to result from adoption of the transformational brownfield plan are reasonable.\n\n(e) Whether the transformational brownfield plan takes into account the criteria described in section 90b(4) of the Michigan strategic fund act, 1984 PA 270, MCL 125.2090b.\n\n(f) Whether subject to subsection (22)(d), the transformational brownfield plan includes provisions for affordable housing.\n\n(4) Within 90 days of the completion of an administratively complete application and the analysis required under subsection (5), the Michigan strategic fund shall approve or reject the transformational brownfield plan, or approve it with modification, by resolution based on the criteria in subsection (3).\n\n(5) In determining whether to approve a transformational brownfield plan under subsection (3)(c) and (d), the Michigan strategic fund shall conduct a financial and underwriting analysis of the developments included in the plan. The analysis must consider both projected rental rates at the time of project delivery and potential increases in rental rates over time. The Michigan strategic fund shall not approve the use of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues beyond the amount determined to be necessary for the project to be economically viable. The Michigan strategic fund shall develop standardized underwriting criteria for determining economic viability. The Michigan strategic fund shall take into account the impact of the sales and use tax exemptions under section 4d(n) of the general sales tax act, 1933 PA 167, MCL 205.54d, and section 4dd of the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.94dd, in determining the amount of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues required for the project to be economically viable. The Michigan strategic fund shall ensure that each transformational brownfield plan includes a significant equity contribution from the owner or developer as determined by the fund.\n\n(6) The Michigan strategic fund shall require an independent, third-party underwriting analysis under subsection (3)(d) for any plan that proposes to use more than $10,000,000.00 in any year in withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues, as determined by the first full year of tax capture under the plan. The cost of the independent, third-party underwriting analysis must be paid by the owner or developer of the eligible property. In addition to the independent, third-party underwriting analysis, the Michigan strategic fund shall require an independent, third-party analysis of the sales and use tax capture revenue estimates for any plan that includes sales and use tax capture revenues. The cost of the independent, third-party analysis must be paid by the owner or developer of the eligible property. The Michigan strategic fund shall consult with the state treasurer before approving any transformational brownfield plan subject to this subsection. This subsection does not limit the ability of the Michigan strategic fund to utilize independent, third-party analyses on plans not subject to this subsection.\n\n(7) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Michigan strategic fund may not approve a transformational brownfield plan that proposes to use more than 50% of the withholding tax capture revenues or 50% of the income tax capture revenues. The Michigan strategic fund may modify the amount of withholding tax capture revenues and income tax capture revenues before approving a transformational brownfield plan to bring the transformational brownfield plan into compliance with subsection (5). The Michigan strategic fund may approve a transformational brownfield plan that proposes to use more than 50% of the income tax capture revenues if 1 of the following applies:\n\n(a) The income tax capture revenues are attributable to the election under section 13c(13).\n\n(b) The applicable eligible properties within the transformational brownfield plan are subject to a written, binding affordable housing agreement with the local governmental unit, which agreement must be provided to the Michigan strategic fund, in which case the Michigan strategic fund may approve a transformational brownfield plan that proposes to use up to 100% of the income tax capture revenues, subject to the underwriting and financial analysis required under subsection (5).\n\n(8) The Michigan strategic fund shall require the owner or developer of the eligible property to certify the actual capital investment, as determined in accordance with section 2(o)(v) and (hhh), on the completion of construction and before the commencement of reimbursement from withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, sales and use tax capture revenues, or tax increment revenues, for the plan or the distinct phase or project within the plan for which reimbursement will be provided. If the actual capital investment is less than the amount included in the plan, the Michigan strategic fund shall review the determination under subsection (5) and may modify the amount of reimbursement if, and to the extent, such a modification is necessary to maintain compliance with subsection (5). The transformational brownfield plan, work plan, and development and reimbursement agreement must include provisions to enforce the requirements and remedies under this subsection. If the actual level of capital investment does not meet the applicable minimum investment requirement under section 2(hhh) and is outside of the safe harbor under subsection (15), the Michigan strategic fund may take 1 of the following remedial actions:\n\n(a) For a plan that consists of a single development, reduce the amount of reimbursement under the plan.\n\n(b) For a plan that consists of distinct phases or projects, if the failure to meet the minimum investment threshold is the result of failure to undertake additional distinct phases or projects as provided for in the plan, 1 or more of the following:\n\n(i) Permanently rescind the authorization to use tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for the additional distinct phases or projects in the plan.\n\n(ii) If the Michigan strategic fund determines that the applicable owner or developer acted in bad faith, reduce the amount of reimbursement for completed phases of the plan.\n\n(9) On approval by the Michigan strategic fund, the minimum investment requirements in section 2(hhh) and limitation under subsection (22)(a) and (b) may be waived if the transformational brownfield plan meets 1 of the following criteria:\n\n(a) Is for eligible property in an area approved by the Michigan state housing development authority as eligible for blight elimination program funding under the housing finance agency innovation fund for the hardest hit housing markets authorized pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008, division A of Public Law 110-343, 12 USC 5201 to 5261. For purposes of this subdivision, an area approved as eligible for blight elimination program funding means that specific portion or portions of a municipality where the Michigan state housing development authority approved the expenditure of blight elimination program funds pursuant to an application identifying the target areas.\n\n(b) Is for eligible property in a municipality that was subject to a state of emergency under the emergency management act, 1976 PA 390, MCL 30.401 to 30.421, issued for drinking water contamination.\n\n(c) Is for eligible property that is a historic resource if the Michigan strategic fund determines the redevelopment is not economically feasible absent the transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(d) Is for eligible property that is located in a city, village, or township with a population of less than 25,000 or that is otherwise eligible for the corresponding population tier in section 2(hhh)(vi), as determined in accordance with subsection (15), if the Michigan strategic fund determines that the redevelopment is not economically feasible absent the transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(10) In determining whether a plan under subsection (9) has a transformational impact for purposes of section 2(hhh) and subsection (3)(a), the governing body and Michigan strategic fund shall consider the impact of the transformational brownfield plan in relation to existing investment and development conditions in the project area and whether the transformational brownfield plan will act as a catalyst for additional revitalization of the area in which it is located.\n\n(11) The Michigan strategic fund may not approve more than 5 transformational brownfield plans under subsection (9) in a calendar year, except that if the Michigan strategic fund approves fewer than 5 plans in a calendar year under subsection (9), the unused approval authority carries forward into future calendar years and remains available until December 31, 2027. The Michigan strategic fund also shall not approve more than 5 transformational brownfield plans under subsection (9) in any individual city, village, or township before December 31, 2022.\n\n(12) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, amendments to an approved transformational brownfield plan must be submitted by the authority to the governing body and to the Michigan strategic fund for approval or rejection following the same notice necessary for approval or rejection of the original transformational brownfield plan. Notice is not required for revisions in the estimates of tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues.\n\n(13) Except as provided in this subsection, an amendment to an approved transformational brownfield plan under section 13c(1) is not considered a new plan approval subject to the limitation in subsection (22)(a). The Michigan strategic fund may consider an amendment as a new plan approval only if the amendment adds eligible property and the Michigan strategic fund determines that approving the addition as an amendment would be inconsistent with the purposes of this act.\n\n(14) The procedure, adequacy of notice, and findings under this section are presumptively valid unless contested in a court of competent jurisdiction within 60 days after approval of the transformational brownfield plan by the Michigan strategic fund. An approved amendment to a conclusive transformational brownfield plan is likewise conclusive unless contested within 60 days after approval of the amendment by the Michigan strategic fund. If a resolution adopting an amendment to the transformational brownfield plan is contested, the original resolution adopting the transformational brownfield plan is not open to contest.\n\n(15) The determination as to whether a transformational brownfield plan complies with the minimum investment requirements in section 2(hhh) must be made with reference to the most recent decennial census data available at the time of approval by the authority. A plan in a municipality that exceeds a population tier under section 2(hhh) by not more than 10% of the maximum population for that tier is, on election of the authority, subject to the investment requirement for that tier. A transformational brownfield plan that is expected to result in, or does result in, a total capital investment that is within 10% of the applicable minimum investment requirement is considered to satisfy the applicable requirement under section 2(hhh).\n\n(16) For purposes of a transformational brownfield plan, determination as to whether property is functionally obsolete may include considerations of economic obsolescence as determined in accordance with the Michigan state tax commission's assessor's manual.\n\n(17) Any positive or negative determination by the Michigan strategic fund under this section must be supported by objective analysis and documented in the record of its proceedings.\n\n(18) The Michigan strategic fund shall charge and collect a reasonable application fee as necessary to cover the costs associated with the review and approval of a transformational brownfield plan.\n\n(19) The Michigan strategic fund shall not commit, and the department of treasury shall not disburse, more than $80,000,000.00 in total annual tax capture. As used in this subsection, \"total annual tax capture\" means the total annual amount of income tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues that may be reimbursed each calendar year under all transformational brownfield plans. In addition to the $80,000,000.00 annual limit, both of the following provisions apply:\n\n(a) With respect to the availability of uncommitted amounts, if an amount authorized to be committed for a calendar year has not been committed, the uncommitted amount for that calendar year remains available to be committed and disbursed in a subsequent calendar year and is in addition to the annual limits otherwise applicable. However, not more than $30,000,000.00 may be committed or disbursed in any calendar year above the $80,000,000.00 annual limit as a result of the operation of this subdivision, and all commitments and disbursements under this subdivision remain subject to the overall limitation in subsection (20).\n\n(b) With respect to the availability of committed but undisbursed amounts, if an amount has been committed under an approved transformational brownfield plan for a calendar year but has not been disbursed, the undisbursed amount for that year is available to be disbursed in a subsequent calendar year and is in addition to the annual limit otherwise applicable.\n\n(20) The Michigan strategic fund shall not commit, and the department of treasury shall not disburse, a total amount of income tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues that exceeds $1,600,000,000.00.\n\n(21) The Michigan strategic fund shall not approve more than a total of $200,000,000.00 in construction period tax capture revenues. The Michigan strategic fund shall project the value of the sales and use tax exemptions under each transformational brownfield plan at the time of plan approval and shall require such information from the owner or developer as is necessary to perform this calculation. The Michigan strategic fund also shall require the owner or developer of the eligible property to report the actual value of the sales and use tax exemptions each tax year of the construction period and at the end of the construction period.\n\n(22) The Michigan strategic fund shall comply with all of the following:\n\n(a) Not approve more than 5 transformational brownfield plans in a calendar year, except that if the Michigan strategic fund approves fewer than 5 plans in a calendar year, the unused approval authority carries forward into future calendar years and remains available until December 31, 2027.\n\n(b) Not approve more than 5 transformational brownfield plans in any individual city, village, or township before December 31, 2022.\n\n(c) Ensure an equitable geographic distribution of plans approved under this subsection, which must achieve a balance between the needs of municipalities of differing sizes and differing geographic areas of the state. Subject to the receipt of qualified transformational brownfield plans meeting the criteria under this section and section 13c, the Michigan strategic fund shall ensure that both of the following requirements are met:\n\n(i) Not less than 33% and not more than 38% of the total transformational brownfield plans approved under this act before December 31, 2027 will be located in cities, villages, and townships with a population of less than 100,000.\n\n(ii) Not less than 33% and not more than 38% of the total transformational brownfield plans approved under this act before December 31, 2027 will be located in cities, villages, and townships with a population of not less than 100,000 and not more than 225,000.\n\n(d) In coordination with the governing body, shall determine the appropriate provisions regarding affordable housing on a plan-by-plan basis.\n\n(23) In the event of a proposed change in ownership of eligible property subject to a transformational brownfield plan for which reimbursement will continue, the approval of the Michigan strategic fund is required before the assignment or transfer of the development and reimbursement agreement.\n\n(24) If the Michigan strategic fund approves a transformational brownfield plan and work plan, and subsequent to that approval, amendments are made to this act, the Michigan strategic fund may amend those plans to make conforming and consistent changes to the approved transformational brownfield plan and work plan on an administrative basis, if those changes do not result in any increase in the aggregate total amount of reimbursement authorized under the initial transformational brownfield plan. The authority of the Michigan strategic fund to administratively amend transformational brownfield plans and work plans under this subsection also applies to transformational brownfield plans and work plans entered into before December 27, 2021.\n\n(25) The Michigan strategic fund shall not approve any new transformational brownfield plans after December 31, 2027. A transformational brownfield plan approved before December 31, 2022 remains in effect and may be amended in accordance with this act.\n\n(26) On approval by the Michigan strategic fund, the mixed-use requirement in section 2(hhh) may be waived for a brownfield plan that otherwise meets the location, population, and minimum investment requirement under section 2(hhh)(vi).\n\nHistory:Add. 2017, Act 46, Eff.

      "text": "(1) To seek department approval of a work plan under section 13b(6)(c), the authority shall submit all of the following for each eligible property:\n\n(a) A copy of the brownfield plan.\n\n(b) Current ownership information for each eligible property and a summary of available information on proposed future ownership, including the amount of any delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties that may be due.\n\n(c) A summary of available information on the historical and current use of each eligible property, including a brief summary of site conditions and what is known about environmental contamination as that term is defined in section 20101 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.20101.\n\n(d) Existing and proposed future zoning for each eligible property.\n\n(e) A brief summary of the proposed redevelopment and future use for each eligible property.\n\n(2) On receipt of a request for approval of a work plan under subsection (1) or a portion of a work plan that pertains to only department specific activities, the department shall review the work plan according to subsection (3) and provide 1 of the following written responses to the requesting authority within 60 days:\n\n(a) An unconditional approval.\n\n(b) A conditional approval that delineates specific necessary modifications to the work plan to meet the criteria of subsection (3), including, but not limited to, individual activities to be modified, added, or deleted from the work plan and revision of costs. The department may not condition its approval on deletions from or modifications of the work plan relating to activities to be funded solely by tax increment revenues not attributable to taxes levied for school operating purposes.\n\n(c) If the work plan lacks sufficient information for the department to respond under subdivision (a), (b), or (d) for any specific activity, a letter stating with specificity the necessary additions or changes to the work plan to be submitted before that activity will be considered by the department. The department shall respond under subdivision (a), (b), or (d) according to this section for the other activities in the work plan.\n\n(d) A denial if the property is not an eligible property under this act, if the work plan contemplates the use of taxes levied for school operating purposes prohibited by section 13b(10), or for any specific activity if the activity is prohibited by section 13b(6)(a). The department may also deny any activity in a work plan that does not meet the conditions in subsection (3) only if the department cannot respond under subdivision (b) or (c). The department shall accompany the denial with a letter that states with specificity the reason for the denial. The department shall respond under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) according to this section for any activities in the work plan that are not denied under this subdivision. If the department denies all or a portion of a work plan under this subdivision, the authority may subsequently resubmit the work plan.\n\n(3) The department may approve a work plan if the following conditions have been met:\n\n(a) Whether some or all of the activities constitute department specific activities other than activities that are exempt from the work plan approval process under section 13b(8).\n\n(b) The department specific activities, other than the activities that are exempt from the work plan approval process under section 13b(8), are protective of the public health, safety, and welfare and the environment. The department may approve department specific activities that are more protective of the public health, safety, and welfare and the environment than required by section 20107a of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.20107a, if those activities provide public health or environmental benefit. In review of a work plan that includes department specific activities that are more protective of the public health, safety, and welfare and the environment, the department's considerations may include, but are not limited to, all of the following:\n\n(i) Proposed new land use and reliability of restrictions to prevent exposure to contamination.\n\n(ii) The cost to implement activities minimally necessary to achieve due care compliance, the total cost of response activities, and the incremental cost of department specific activities in excess of those activities minimally necessary to achieve due care compliance.\n\n(iii) Long-term obligations associated with leaving contamination in place and the value of reducing or eliminating these obligations.\n\n(c) The estimated costs for the activities as a whole are reasonable for the stated purpose. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), the department shall make the determination in this subdivision only after the department determines that the conditions in subdivisions (a) and (b) have been met.\n\n(4) If the department fails to provide a written response under subsection (2) within 60 days after receipt of a request for approval of a work plan, the authority may proceed with the activities as outlined in the work plan as submitted for approval. Except as provided in subsection (5), activities conducted pursuant to a work plan that was submitted to the department for approval but for which the department failed to provide a written response under subsection (2) are considered approved for the purposes of subsection (1). Within 45 days after receiving additional information requested from the authority under subsection (2)(c), the department shall review the additional information according to subsection (3) and provide 1 of the responses described in subsection (2) to the requesting authority for the specific activity. If the department does not provide a response to the requesting authority within 45 days after receiving the additional information requested under subsection (2)(c), the activity is approved under section 13b.\n\n(5) The department may issue a written response to a work plan more than 60 days but less than 6 months after receipt of a request for approval. If the department issues a written response under this subsection, the authority is not required to conduct individual activities that are in addition to the individual activities included in the work plan as it was submitted for approval and failure to conduct these additional activities does not affect the authority's ability to capture taxes under section 13b for the eligible activities described in the work plan initially submitted under subsection (4). In addition, at the option of the authority, these additional individual activities are considered part of the work plan of the authority and approved for purposes of section 13b. However, any response by the department under this subsection that identifies additional individual activities that must be carried out to satisfy part 201 or part 213 must be satisfactorily completed for the activities to be considered acceptable for the purposes of compliance with part 201 or part 213.\n\n(6) If the department issues a written response under subsection (5) to a work plan and if the department's written response modifies an individual activity proposed by the work plan of the authority in a manner that reduces or eliminates a proposed response activity, the authority must complete those individual activities in accordance with the department's response in order for that portion of the work plan to be considered approved for purposes of section 13b, unless 1 or more of the following conditions apply:\n\n(a) Obligations for the individual activity have been issued by the authority, or by a municipality on behalf of the authority, to fund the individual activity before issuance of the department's response.\n\n(b) The individual activity has commenced or payment for the work has been irrevocably obligated before issuance of the department's response.\n\n(7) It is in the sole discretion of an authority to propose to undertake department specific activities under subsection (3)(b) at an eligible property under a brownfield plan.

June 3, 2002Compiler's Notes:The following communication was received:“September 12, 1999The Honorable John EnglerCapitol BuildingLansing, MichiganSubject: PA 381 of 1996Dear Governor Engler:A review of the Senate and House Journals has revealed an error in Enrolled Senate Bill 923, which was filed with the Secretary of State on July 24, 1996, and assigned Public Act No. 381 of 1996. The bill presented to the Governor on July 17, 1996, did not accurately reflect what was agreed to by both houses of the Legislature. Specifically, Section 17, subsection (1), the third sentence incorrectly stated:'The terms of the municipal finance act, Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943, apply to bonds issued under this section.'The sentence agreed to by both houses is:'Except for the requirement of the municipal finance act, Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943, being sections 131.1 to 139.3 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, that the authority receive the approval or an exception from approval from the department of treasury prior to the issuance of bonds under this subsection, the terms of Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943 shall not apply to bonds issued under this section.'Therefore, we are presenting a correct Enrolled Senate Bill 923 for your signature and filing with the Secretary of State. Upon filing, the defective Enrolled Senate Bill 923 will be replaced with the correct Enrolled Senate Bill 923 and assigned the same public act number. The effective date of the Public Act No. 381 of 1996 will be the date the correct bill is filed.This procedure ensures the integrity of the process while providing notification to the public. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you or the citizens of the state of Michigan. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.Sincerely,Carol Morey Viventi Melvin J. DeStigterSecretary of the Senate Clerk of the House of Representativescc: Candice S. Miller, Secretary of State”",
