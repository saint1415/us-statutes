If at the hearing the payer establishes that the withholding is not proper because of a mistake of fact concerning the amount of current or overdue support or the identity of the payer, or that periodic implementation of an administrative adjustment of the amount of the periodic payment of arrears to be withheld will cause an unjust or inappropriate result, the income withholding shall be modified or rescinded according to the guidelines established under section 19 of the friend of the court act, MCL 552.519.\n\n(4) If the hearing provided under subsection (3) is held before a referee, either party may request a de novo hearing as provided in section 7 of the friend of the court act, MCL 552.507.\n\n(5) If a petition for modification of the support order is filed by or on behalf of a payer and is pending at the date scheduled for a hearing under subsection (3), the court may consolidate the hearing under subsection (3) and a hearing on the petition for modification.\n\n(6) All proceedings under this section shall be completed within 45 days after the date that notice was sent under subsection (1), unless otherwise permitted by the court upon a showing of good cause.\n\n(7) The friend of the court office may review the objection administratively before a hearing is held before a referee or judge. If the friend of the court office reviews the objection administratively, either party may object and a hearing shall be held before a referee or judge.\n\nHistory:1982, Act 295, Eff.

A payer, or other person with an interest in the financial assets, must submit a written challenge under this section within 21 days after the financial institution, insurer, or carrier sends the payer a copy of the title IV-D agency notice as required by section 25e.

A payer, or other person with an interest in the financial assets, must file an action under this subsection within 21 days after the title IV-D agency sends notice of its review determination and shall give the title IV-D agency notice of the action.\n\n(5) If an action is not filed in the circuit court within the time limit required by subsection (4), the title IV-D agency shall notify the financial institution, insurer, or carrier, directing the financial institution, insurer, or carrier to act in accordance with the title IV-D agency review determination under this section.

The payer shall do either of the following:\n\n(a) Post the bond set by the court in the bench warrant.\n\n(b) Be taken promptly before the court for further proceedings.\n\n(8) If a bond is posted under subsection (7)(a), the friend of the court or the clerk of the court shall give a receipt to the payer that substantially conforms to the requirements of subsection (2). The receipt shall direct the payer to appear before the court at a specific time and date. The friend of the court or the clerk of the court shall notify a local law enforcement agency to remove the bench warrant from the law enforcement information network as provided by the C.J.I.S. policy council act, 1974 PA 163, MCL 28.211 to 28.215.\n\nHistory:1982, Act 295, Eff.
