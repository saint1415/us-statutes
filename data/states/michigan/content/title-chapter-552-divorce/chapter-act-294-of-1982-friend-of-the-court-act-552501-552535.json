Within 14 days after receipt of the review request, the office shall determine whether the order is due for review.

Reasonable grounds to review an order under this subdivision include any of the following:\n\n(i) Temporary or permanent changes in the physical custody of a child that the court has not ordered.\n\n(ii) Increased or decreased need of the child.\n\n(iii) Probable access by a parent to dependent health care coverage that is accessible to the child and available at a reasonable cost. Health care coverage is presumed accessible to the child and presumed available at a reasonable cost if it meets the guidelines provided in the child support formula developed by the bureau under section 19.\n\n(iv) Changed dependent health care coverage cost from the amount used in the previous child support order.\n\n(v) Changed financial conditions of a recipient of support or a payer, including application for or receipt of public assistance, unemployment compensation, or worker's compensation.\n\n(vi) That the order was based on incorrect facts.\n\n(2) A review initiated by the office under subsection (1)(f) does not preclude the recipient of support or payer from requesting a review under subsection (1)(b).\n\n(3) Within 180 days after determining that a review is required under subsection (1), the office must obtain a modification of the order if appropriate.\n\n(4) The office must use the child support formula developed by the bureau under section 19 in calculating the child support award under section 17b.\n\n(5) The office must petition the court if modification is determined to be necessary under section 17b unless either of the following applies:\n\n(a) The difference between the existing and projected child support award is less than the minimum threshold for modification of a child support amount as established by the formula.\n\n(b) The court previously determined that application of the formula was unjust or inappropriate and the office determines that the facts of the case and the reasons for and amount of the previous deviation remain unchanged.\n\n(6) The notice under section 17b(3) constitutes a petition for modification of the support order and must be filed with the court.\n\n(7) If the office determines there should be no change in the order and a party objects to the determination in writing to the office within 21 days after the date of the notice provided for in section 17b(3), the office must schedule a hearing before the court.\n\n(8) If a support order lacks provisions for health care coverage, the office must petition the court for a modification to require that 1 or both parents obtain or maintain health care coverage for the benefit of each child who is subject to the support order when health care coverage is accessible to the child and available at a reasonable cost. The office must use the guidelines provided for in the child support formula developed by the bureau under section 19 to recommend which parent provides health care coverage that is accessible to the child and available at a reasonable cost. The office must not petition the court to require both parents to provide health care coverage under this subsection unless both parents already provide coverage or both agree to provide coverage. This subsection does not prevent the court from exercising its discretion to order health care coverage based on the child's needs or the parent's resources.\n\n(9) The office must determine the costs to each parent for dependent health care coverage and child care costs and must disclose those costs in the recommendation under section 17b(3).\n\nHistory:1982, Act 294, Eff.

If the friend of the court office recommends a support amount based on imputed income, the recommendation shall also state the amount that would have been recommended based on the actual income of the parties if the actual income of the parties is known. If income is imputed, the recommendation shall recite all factual assumptions upon which the imputed income is based.\n\n(b) The friend of the court office may impute income to a party who fails or refuses to provide information requested under subsection (2).\n\n(c) At a hearing based on an objection to a friend of the court office recommendation, the trier of fact may consider the friend of the court office's recommendation as evidence to prove a fact relevant to the support calculation if no other evidence is presented concerning that fact, if the parties agree or no objection is made to its use for that purpose.\n\n(7) The court shall not require proof of a substantial change in circumstances to modify a child support order when support is adjusted under section 17(1).\n\n(8) A party may also file a motion to modify support. Upon motion of a party, the court may only modify a child support order upon finding a substantial change in circumstances, including, but not limited to, health care coverage becoming newly available to a party and a change in the support level under section 17(5)(a).\n\n(9) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the friend of the court office shall conduct a more frequent review of the support order upon presentation by a party of evidence of a substantial change in circumstances as set forth in the child support formula guidelines.\n\nHistory:Add. 1994, Act 37, Imd.
