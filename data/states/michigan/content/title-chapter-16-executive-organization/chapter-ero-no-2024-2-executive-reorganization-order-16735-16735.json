      "text": "During my time in office, I have demonstrated my commitment to cutting red tape and streamlining government. I have signed legislation that makes it easier for Michigan families to transfer assets when a family member has passed. I have worked with our legislature to remove inefficient, duplicative steps in agencies' rules review processes. And I have done away with ranking systems that hobbled our schools. Now, I am turning my attention to Michigan's boards, councils, commissions, and committees.\n\nMichigan boasts over 250 of these boards, which are made up of over 2,300 appointees. From our many agricultural commodities boards, to our professional licensing boards, to our cultural and ethnic advocacy commissions, the myriad of interests, industries, and perspectives that make Michigan a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a family are represented across our state boards and commissions.\n\nBut some of these boards no longer serve their original purposes. Some were created with specific mandates that have been met or exceeded. Others have changed scope in ways that no longer align with practical realities, the current state of issues, or our current understanding of technology. Still others are duplicative of other boards, which can create both redundancies and conflicts. More were created with a focus on specific perspectives through a number of designated seats that no longer accurately represent the field of view or serve the interest of the council or committee.\n\nIn the interest of good government, I am proactively correcting these issues, including the rightsizing of boards and commissions, the adjustment of seat designations and, in some cases, the modification or abolishment of certain committees and councils. In doing so, I am cutting red tape and taking action to ensure governmental power rests where it ought, and that Michigan's government works for Michiganders.\n\nSection 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the Governor.\n\nSection 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that are necessary for efficient administration.\n\nCertain changes to several state boards, commissions, and councils are needed. These changes will ensure the efficient administration and effectiveness of government.\n\nActing pursuant to the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:\n\n1. General Provisions\n\n(a) Enforcability. This Order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party.\n\n(b) Severability. The provisions of this Order are severable, and if any provision, or portion thereof, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such unconstitutionality or invalidity does not affect the remaining provisions, which remain in force.\n\n(c) No Abatement.

The director of a department with implementation responsibilities under this Order may request the assistance of other state departments, agencies, and officers with respect to personnel, budgeting, procurement, telecommunications, information systems, legal services, and other management-related functions, and the departments, agencies, and officers shall provide that assistance.\n\n(6) The State Budget Director shall determine and authorize the most efficient manner possible for handling financial transactions and records in this state's financial management system necessary to implement this Order.\n\n(7) A rule, regulation, order, contract, or agreement relating to a function or responsibility transferred under this Order lawfully adopted before the effective date of this Order will continue to be effective until revised, amended, repealed, or rescinded.\n\n2.
