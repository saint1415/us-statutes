      "text": "(1) The legislative body of the local governmental unit, in its resolution approving an application, shall set forth a finding and determination that the granting of the industrial facilities exemption certificate, considered together with the aggregate amount of industrial facilities exemption certificates previously granted and currently in force, shall not have the effect of substantially impeding the operation of the local governmental unit or impairing the financial soundness of a taxing unit that levies an ad valorem property tax in the local governmental unit in which the facility is located or to be located. If the state equalized valuation of property proposed to be exempt pursuant to an application under consideration, considered together with the aggregate state equalized valuation of property exempt under certificates previously granted and currently in force, exceeds 5% of the state equalized valuation of the local governmental unit, the commission, with the approval of the state treasurer, shall make a separate finding and shall include a statement in the order approving the industrial facilities exemption certificate that exceeding that amount shall not have the effect of substantially impeding the operation of the local governmental unit or impairing the financial soundness of an affected taxing unit.\n\n(2) Except for an application for a speculative building, which is governed by subsection (4), the legislative body of the local governmental unit shall not approve an application and the commission shall not grant an industrial facilities exemption certificate unless the applicant complies with all of the following requirements:\n\n(a) The commencement of the restoration, replacement, or construction of the facility occurred not earlier than 12 months before the filing of the application for the industrial facilities exemption certificate. If the application is not filed within the 12-month period, the application may be filed within the succeeding 12-month period and the industrial facilities exemption certificate shall in this case expire 1 year earlier than it would have expired if the application had been timely filed. This subdivision does not apply for applications filed with the local governmental unit after December 31, 1983.\n\n(b) For applications made after December 31, 1983, the proposed facility shall be located within a plant rehabilitation district or industrial development district that was duly established in a local governmental unit eligible under this act to establish a district and that was established upon a request filed or by the local governmental unit's own initiative taken before the commencement of the restoration, replacement, or construction of the facility.\n\n(c) For applications made after December 31, 1983, the commencement of the restoration, replacement, or construction of the facility occurred not earlier than 6 months before the filing of the application for the industrial facilities exemption certificate.\n\n(d) The application relates to a construction, restoration, or replacement program that when completed constitutes a new or replacement facility within the meaning of this act and that shall be situated within a plant rehabilitation district or industrial development district duly established in a local governmental unit eligible under this act to establish the district.\n\n(e) Completion of the facility is calculated to, and will at the time of issuance of the certificate have the reasonable likelihood to create employment, retain employment, prevent a loss of employment, or produce energy in the community in which the facility is situated.\n\n(f) Completion of the facility does not constitute merely the addition of machinery and equipment for the purpose of increasing productive capacity but rather is primarily for the purpose and will primarily have the effect of restoration, replacement, or updating the technology of obsolete industrial property.

If a resolution authorizing the exemption is adopted in the same manner as provided in section 7hh of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7hh, a speculative building, a new facility, or a replacement facility owned or operated by a qualified start-up business is exempt from the industrial facility tax levied under this act, except for that portion of the industrial facility tax attributable to a special assessment or a tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff, for the year in which the resolution is adopted.
