After an eligible business has entered into a written agreement as provided in subsection (2), the authority may adjust the number of full-time jobs required to be maintained by the authorized business under this subdivision, in order to adjust for decreases in full-time jobs in the authorized business in this state due to the divestiture of operations, provided a single other person continues to maintain those full-time jobs in this state. The authority shall not approve a reduction in the number of full-time jobs to be maintained unless the authority has determined that it can monitor the maintenance of the full-time jobs in this state by the other person, and the authorized business agrees in writing that the continued maintenance of the full-time jobs in this state by the other person, as determined by the authority, is a condition of receiving tax credits under the written agreement.

Except as otherwise provided under this section, the duration of the tax credits shall not exceed 20 years or for an authorized business that is a distressed business, 3 years. In determining the amount and duration of tax credits authorized, the authority shall consider the following factors:\n\n(a) The number of qualified new jobs to be created or retained jobs to be maintained.\n\n(b) The average wage and health care benefit level of the qualified new jobs or retained jobs relative to the average wage and health care benefit paid by private entities in the county in which the facility is located.\n\n(c) The total capital investment or new capital investment the eligible business will make.\n\n(d) The cost differential to the business between expanding, locating, or retaining new jobs in Michigan and a site outside of Michigan.\n\n(e) The potential impact of the expansion, retention, or location on the economy of Michigan.\n\n(f) The cost of the credit under section 9, the staff, financial, or economic assistance provided by the local government unit, or local economic development corporation or similar entity, and the value of assistance otherwise provided by this state.\n\n(g) Whether the expansion, retention, or location will occur in this state without the tax credits offered under this act.\n\n(h) Whether the authorized business reuses or redevelops property that was previously used for an industrial or commercial purpose in locating the facility.\n\n(i) The project's effects on other Michigan businesses within the same industry.\n\n(3) A written agreement between an eligible business and the authority shall include, but need not be limited to, all of the following:\n\n(a) A description of the business expansion, retention, or location that is the subject of the agreement.\n\n(b) Conditions upon which the authorized business designation is made.\n\n(c) A statement by the eligible business that a violation of the written agreement may result in the revocation of the designation as an authorized business and the loss or reduction of future credits under section 9.\n\n(d) A statement by the eligible business that a misrepresentation in the application may result in the revocation of the designation as an authorized business and the refund of credits received under section 9 plus a penalty equal to 10% of the credits received under section 9.\n\n(e) A method for measuring full-time jobs before and after an expansion, retention, or location of an authorized business in this state.\n\n(f) A written certification from the eligible business regarding all of the following:\n\n(i) The eligible business will follow a competitive bid process for the construction, rehabilitation, development, or renovation of the facility, and that this process will be open to all Michigan residents and firms.
