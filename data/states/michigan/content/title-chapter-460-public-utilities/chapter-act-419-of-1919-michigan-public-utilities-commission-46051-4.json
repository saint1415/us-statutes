Subject to the provisions of this act the said commission shall have the same measure of authority with reference to such utilities as is granted and conferred with respect to railroads and railroad companies under the various provisions of the statutes creating the Michigan railroad commission and defining its powers and duties. The power and authority granted by this act shall not extend to, or include, any power of regulation or control of any municipally owned utility; and it shall be the duty of said commission on the request of any city or village to give advice and render such assistance as may be reasonable and expedient with respect to the operation of any utility owned and operated by such city or village. In no case shall the commission have power to change or alter the rates or charges fixed in, or regulated by, any franchise or agreement heretofore or hereafter granted or made by any city, village or township. It shall be competent for any municipality and any public utility operating within the limits of said municipality, whether such utility is operating under the terms of a franchise or otherwise, to join in submitting to the commission any question involving the fixing or determination of rates or charges, or the making of rules or conditions of service, and the commission shall thereupon be empowered, and it shall be its duty to make full investigation as to all matters so submitted and to fix and establish such reasonable maximum rates and charges, and prescribe such rules and conditions of service and make such determination and order relative thereto as shall be just and reasonable. Such order when so made shall have like force and effect as other orders made under the provisions of this act. In any case where a franchise under which a utility is, or has been, operated, including street railways, shall have heretofore expired or shall hereafter expire, the municipality shall have the right to petition the commission to fix the rates and charges of said utility in accordance with the provisions of this act, or to make complaint as herein provided with reference to any practice, service or regulation of such utility, and thereupon said commission shall have full jurisdiction in the premises.\n\nHistory:1919, Act 419, Imd.

An investigation of any such complaint, and the formal hearing thereon, if such is deemed necessary, may be held at any place within the state and by any member or members of the commission, or by any duly authorized representative thereof. Witnesses may be summoned and the production of books, and records before the commission, or the member, or any duly authorized representative thereof conducting the hearing, may be required. Any witness summoned to appear or to produce papers at any such hearing, who neglects or refuses so to do shall be deemed guilty of a contempt. It shall be competent for the commission in any such case to make application to any circuit court of the state setting forth the facts of the matter. Thereupon said court shall have the same power and authority to punish for the contempt and to compel obedience to the subpoena or order of the commission as though such person were in contempt of such court or had neglected or refused to obey its lawful order or process.

Upon the completion of any such hearing, the commission shall have authority to make an order or decree dismissing the complaint or directing that the rate, charge, practice or other matter complained of, shall be removed, modified or altered, as the commission deems just, equitable and in accordance with the rights of the parties concerned. For attending on any such hearing, any witness summoned by the commission shall be entitled to the same fees as are, or may be, provided by law for attending the circuit court in any civil matter or proceedings, which said fees shall be paid out of the general fund in the treasury of the state. All claims for such fees shall be approved by the secretary, or by some member of the commission, and shall be audited and allowed by the board of state auditors.\n\nHistory:1919, Act 419, Imd. Eff.
