      "text": "(1) A gas utility, electric utility, or steam utility shall not increase its rates and charges or alter, change, or amend any rate or rate schedules, the effect of which will be to increase the cost of services to its customers, without first receiving commission approval as provided in this section. A utility shall coordinate with the commission staff in advance of filing its general rate case application under this section to avoid resource challenges with applications being filed at the same time as applications filed under this section by other utilities. In the case of electric utilities serving more than 1,000,000 customers in this state, the commission may, if necessary, order a delay in filing an application to establish a 21-day spacing between filings of electric utilities serving more than 1,000,000 customers in this state. The utility shall place in evidence facts relied upon to support the utility's petition or application to increase its rates and charges, or to alter, change, or amend any rate or rate schedules. The commission shall require notice to be given to all interested parties within the service area to be affected, and allow interested parties a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing. A utility may use projected costs and revenues for a future consecutive 12-month period in developing its requested rates and charges. The commission shall notify the utility within 30 days after filing, whether the utility's petition or application is complete. A petition or application is considered complete if it complies with the rate application filing forms and instructions adopted under subsection (8). If the application is not complete, the commission shall notify the utility of all information necessary to make that filing complete. If the commission has not notified the utility within 30 days of whether the utility's petition or application is complete, the application is considered complete. Concurrently with filing a complete application, or at any time after filing a complete application, a gas utility serving fewer than 1,000,000 customers in this state may file a motion seeking partial and immediate rate relief. After providing notice to the interested parties within the service area to be affected and affording interested parties a reasonable opportunity to present written evidence and written arguments relevant to the motion seeking partial and immediate rate relief, the commission shall make a finding and enter an order granting or denying partial and immediate relief within 180 days after the motion seeking partial and immediate rate relief was submitted. The commission has 12 months to issue a final order in a case in which a gas utility has filed a motion seeking partial and immediate rate relief.\n\n(2) If the commission has not issued an order within 180 days after the filing of a complete application, the utility may implement up to the amount of the proposed annual rate request through equal percentage increases or decreases applied to all base rates. If the utility uses projected costs and revenues for a future period in developing its requested rates and charges, the utility may not implement the equal percentage increases or decreases before the calendar date corresponding to the start of the projected 12-month period. For good cause, the commission may issue a temporary order preventing or delaying a utility from implementing its proposed rates or charges. If a utility implements increased rates or charges under this subsection before the commission issues a final order, that utility shall refund to customers, with interest, any portion of the total revenues collected through application of the equal percentage increase that exceed the total that would have been produced by the rates or charges subsequently ordered by the commission in its final order. The commission shall allocate any refund required by this subsection among primary customers based upon their pro rata share of the total revenue collected through the applicable increase, and among secondary and residential customers in a manner to be determined by the commission. The rate of interest for refunds is 5% plus the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for the appropriate time period. For any portion of the refund that, exclusive of interest, exceeds 25% of the annual revenue increase awarded by the commission in its final order, the rate of interest is the authorized rate of return on the common stock of the utility during the appropriate period. Any refund or interest awarded under this subsection must not be included, in whole or in part, in any application for a rate increase by a utility. This subsection only applies to completed applications filed with the commission before April 20, 2017.\n\n(3) This section does not impair the commission's ability to issue a show cause order as part of its rate-making authority. An alteration or amendment in rates or rate schedules applied for by a public utility that will not result in an increase in the cost of service to its customers may be authorized and approved without notice or hearing. There shall be no increase in rates based upon changes in cost of fuel, purchased gas, or purchased steam unless notice has been given within the service area to be affected, and there has been an opportunity for a full and complete hearing on the cost of fuel, purchased gas, or purchased steam. The rates charged by any utility under an automatic fuel, purchased gas, or purchased steam adjustment clause shall not be altered, changed, or amended unless notice has been given within the service area to be affected, and there has been an opportunity for a full and complete hearing on the cost of the fuel, purchased gas, or purchased steam.\n\n(4) The commission shall adopt rules and procedures for the filing, investigation, and hearing of petitions or applications to increase or decrease utility rates and charges as the commission finds necessary or appropriate to enable it to reach a final decision with respect to petitions or applications within a period of time allotted by law to issue a final order after the filing of the complete petitions or applications. The commission shall not authorize or approve adjustment clauses that operate without notice and an opportunity for a full and complete hearing, and all such clauses are abolished. The commission may hold a full and complete hearing to determine the cost of fuel, purchased gas, purchased steam, or purchased power separately from a full and complete hearing on a general rate case and may hold that hearing concurrently with the general rate case. The commission shall authorize a utility to recover the cost of fuel, purchased gas, purchased steam, or purchased power only to the extent that the purchases are reasonable and prudent.\n\n(5) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection (1), if the commission fails to reach a final decision with respect to a completed petition or application to increase or decrease utility rates within the 10-month period following the filing of the completed petition or application, the petition or application is considered approved. If a utility makes any significant amendment to its filing, the commission has an additional 10 months after the date of the amendment to reach a final decision on the petition or application. If the utility files for an extension of time, the commission shall extend the 10-month period by the amount of additional time requested by the utility.\n\n(6) A utility shall not file a general rate case application for an increase in rates earlier than 12 months after the date of the filing of a complete prior general rate case application. A utility may not file a new general rate case application until the commission has issued a final order on a prior general rate case or until the rates are approved under subsection (5).\n\n(7) The commission shall, if requested by a gas utility, establish load retention transportation rate schedules or approve gas transportation contracts as required for the purpose of serving industrial or commercial customers whose individual annual transportation volumes exceed 500,000 decatherms on the gas utility's system. The commission shall approve these rate schedules or approve transportation contracts entered into by the utility in good faith if the industrial or commercial customer has the installed capability to use an alternative fuel or otherwise has a viable alternative to receiving natural gas transportation service from the utility, the customer can obtain the alternative fuel or gas transportation from an alternative source at a price that would cause them not to use the gas utility's system, and the customer, as a result of their use of the system and receipt of transportation service, makes a significant contribution to the utility's fixed costs. The commission shall adopt accounting and rate-making policies to ensure that the discounts associated with the transportation rate schedules and contracts are recovered by the gas utility through charges applicable to other customers if the incremental costs related to the discounts are no greater than the costs that would be passed on to those customers as the result of a loss of the industrial or commercial customer's contribution to a utility's fixed costs.\n\n(8) The commission shall adopt standard rate application filing forms and instructions for use in all general rate cases filed by utilities whose rates are regulated by the commission. For cooperative electric utilities whose rates are regulated by the commission, in addition to rate applications filed under this section, the commission shall continue to allow for rate filings based on the cooperative's times interest earned ratio. The commission may modify the standard rate application forms and instructions adopted under this subsection.\n\n(9) If, on or before January 1, 2008, a merchant plant entered into a contract with an initial term of 20 years or more to sell electricity to an electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission with 1,000,000 or more retail customers in this state and if, before January 1, 2008, the merchant plant generated electricity under that contract, in whole or in part, from wood or solid wood wastes, then the merchant plant shall, upon petition by the merchant plant, and subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (10), recover the amount, if any, by which the merchant plant's reasonably and prudently incurred actual fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs exceed the amount that the merchant plant is paid under the contract for those costs. This subsection does not apply to landfill gas plants, hydro plants, municipal solid waste plants, or to merchant plants engaged in litigation against an electric utility seeking higher payments for power delivered pursuant to contract.\n\n(10) The total aggregate additional amounts recoverable by merchant plants under subsection (9) in excess of the amounts paid under the contracts must not exceed $1,000,000.00 per month for each affected electric utility. The $1,000,000.00 per month limit specified in this subsection must be reviewed by the commission upon petition of the merchant plant filed no more than once per year and may be adjusted if the commission finds that the eligible merchant plants reasonably and prudently incurred actual fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs exceed the amount that those merchant plants are paid under the contract by more than $1,000,000.00 per month. The annual amount of the adjustments must not exceed a rate equal to the United States Consumer Price Index. The commission shall not make an adjustment unless each affected merchant plant files a petition with the commission. If the total aggregate amount by which the eligible merchant plants reasonably and prudently incurred actual fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs determined by the commission exceed the amount that the merchant plants are paid under the contract by more than $1,000,000.00 per month, the commission shall allocate the additional $1,000,000.00 per month payment among the eligible merchant plants based upon the relationship of excess costs among the eligible merchant plants. The $1,000,000.00 limit specified in this subsection, as adjusted, does not apply to actual fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs that are incurred due to changes in federal or state environmental laws or regulations that are implemented after October 6, 2008. The $1,000,000.00 per month payment limit under this subsection does not apply to merchant plants eligible under subsection (9) whose electricity is purchased by a utility that is using wood or wood waste or fuels derived from those materials for fuel in their power plants. As used in this subsection, \"United States Consumer Price Index\" means the United States Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers as defined and reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n(11) The commission shall issue orders to permit the recovery authorized under subsections (9) and (10) upon petition of the merchant plant. The merchant plant is not required to alter or amend the existing contract with the electric utility in order to obtain the recovery under subsections (9) and (10). The commission shall permit or require the electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission to recover from its ratepayers all fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs that the electric utility is required to pay to the merchant plant as reasonably and prudently incurred costs.\n\n(12) Subject to subsection (13), if requested by an electric utility with less than 200,000 customers in this state, the commission shall approve an appropriate revenue decoupling mechanism that adjusts for decreases in actual sales compared to the projected levels used in that utility's most recent rate case that are the result of implemented energy waste reduction, conservation, demand-side programs, and other waste reduction measures, if the utility first demonstrates the following to the commission:\n\n(a) That the projected sales forecast in the utility's most recent rate case is reasonable.\n\n(b) That the electric utility has achieved annual incremental energy savings at least equal to the lesser of the following:\n\n(i) The incremental energy savings requirement of section 77(1) of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1077.\n\n(ii) The amount of any incremental savings yielded by energy waste reduction, conservation, demand-side programs, and other waste reduction measures approved by the commission in that utility's most recent integrated resource plan.\n\n(13) The commission shall consider the aggregate revenues attributable to revenue decoupling mechanisms, financial incentives, and shared savings mechanisms the commission has approved for an electric utility relative to energy waste reduction, conservation, demand-side programs, peak load reduction, and other waste reduction measures. The commission may approve an alternative methodology for a revenue decoupling mechanism authorized under subsection (12) or a financial incentive authorized under section 75 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1075, if the commission determines that the resulting aggregate revenues from those mechanisms would not result in a reasonable and cost-effective method to ensure that investments in energy waste reduction, demand-side programs, peak load reduction, and other waste reduction measures are not disfavored when compared to utility supply-side investments. The commission's consideration of an alternative methodology under this subsection must be conducted as a contested case in accordance with chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288.\n\n(14) By April 20, 2018, the commission shall conduct a study on an appropriate tariff reflecting equitable cost of service for utility revenue requirements for customers who participate in a net metering program or distributed generation program under the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211. In any rate case filed after June 1, 2018, the commission shall, subject to section 173(7) of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1173, approve such a tariff for inclusion in the rates of all customers participating in a net metering or distributed generation program under the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211. A tariff established under this subsection does not apply to customers participating in a net metering program under the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211, before the date that the commission establishes a tariff under this subsection, who continues to participate in the program at their current site or facility.\n\n(15) Except as otherwise provided in this act, \"utility\" and \"electric utility\" do not include a municipally owned electric utility.\n\n(16) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Full and complete hearing\" means a hearing that provides interested parties a reasonable opportunity to present and cross-examine evidence and present arguments relevant to the specific element or elements of the request that are the subject of the hearing.\n\n(b) \"General rate case\" means a proceeding initiated by a utility in an application filed with the commission that alleges a revenue deficiency and requests an increase in the schedule of rates or charges based on the utility's total cost of providing service.\n\n(c) \"Steam utility\" means a steam distribution company regulated by the commission.\n\nHistory:Add. 1952, Act 243, Eff.

      "text": "(1) As used in this act:\n\n(a) \"Commission\" or \"public service commission\" means the Michigan public service commission created in section 1.\n\n(b) \"Gas cost recovery clause\" means an adjustment clause in the rates or rate schedule of a gas utility which permits the monthly adjustment of rates for gas in order to allow the utility to recover the booked costs of gas sold by the utility if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.\n\n(c) \"Gas cost recovery factor\" means that element of the rates to be charged for gas service to reflect gas costs incurred by a gas utility and made pursuant to a gas cost recovery clause incorporated in the rates or rate schedules of a gas utility.\n\n(d) \"General rate case\" means a proceeding before the commission in which interested parties are given notice and a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing on a utility's total cost of service and all other lawful elements properly to be considered in determining just and reasonable rates.\n\n(e) \"Interested persons\" means the attorney general, the technical staff of the commission, any intervenor admitted to 1 of the utility's 2 previous general rate cases, any intervenor admitted to 1 of the utility's 2 previous reconciliation hearings, or any association of utility customers which meets the requirements to intervene in a reconciliation hearing under the rules of practice and procedure of the commission as applicable.\n\n(2) Pursuant to its authority under this act, the public service commission may incorporate a gas cost recovery clause in the rates or rate schedule of a gas utility, but is not required to do so. Any order incorporating a gas cost recovery clause shall be as a result of a hearing solely on the question of the inclusion of the clause in the rates or rate schedule, which hearing shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.271 to 24.287 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or, pursuant to subsection (17), as a result of a general rate case. Any order incorporating a gas cost recovery clause shall replace and rescind any previous purchased gas adjustment clause incorporated in the rates of the utility upon the effective date of the first gas cost recovery factor authorized for the utility under its gas cost recovery clause.\n\n(3) In order to implement the gas cost recovery clause established pursuant to subsection (2), a utility annually shall file, pursuant to procedures established by the commission, if any, a complete gas cost recovery plan describing the expected sources and volumes of its gas supply and changes in the cost of gas anticipated over a future 12-month period specified by the commission and requesting for each of those 12 months a specific gas cost recovery factor. The plan shall be filed not less than 3 months before the beginning of the 12-month period covered by the plan. The plan shall describe all major contracts and gas supply arrangements entered into by the utility for obtaining gas during the specified 12-month period. The description of the major contracts and arrangements shall include the price of the gas, the duration of the contract or arrangement, and an explanation or description of any other term or provision as required by the commission. The plan shall also include the gas utility's evaluation of the reasonableness and prudence of its decisions to obtain gas in the manner described in the plan, in light of the major alternative gas supplies available to the utility, and an explanation of the legal and regulatory actions taken by the utility to minimize the cost of gas purchased by the utility.\n\n(4) In order to implement the gas cost recovery clause established pursuant to subsection (2), a gas utility shall file, contemporaneously with the gas cost recovery plan described in subsection (3), a 5-year forecast of the gas requirements of its customers, its anticipated sources of supply, and projections of gas costs. The forecast shall include a description of all relevant major contracts and gas supply arrangements entered into or contemplated between the gas utility and its suppliers, a description of all major gas supply arrangements which the gas utility knows have been, or expects will be, entered into between the gas utility's principal pipeline suppliers and their major sources of gas, and such other information as the commission may require.\n\n(5) If a utility files a gas cost recovery plan and a 5-year forecast as provided in subsections (3) and (4), the commission shall conduct a proceeding, to be known as a gas supply and cost review, for the purpose of evaluating the reasonableness and prudence of the plan, and establishing the gas cost recovery factors to implement a gas cost recovery clause incorporated in the rates or rate schedule of the gas utility. The gas supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969.\n\n(6) In its final order in a gas supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the decisions underlying the gas cost recovery plan filed by the gas utility pursuant to subsection (3), and shall approve, disapprove, or amend the gas cost recovery plan accordingly. In evaluating the decisions underlying the gas cost recovery plan, the commission shall consider the volume, cost, and reliability of the major alternative gas supplies available to the utility; the cost of alternative fuels available to some or all of the utility's customers; the availability of gas in storage; the ability of the utility to reduce or to eliminate any sales to out-of-state customers; whether the utility has taken all appropriate legal and regulatory actions to minimize the cost of purchased gas; and other relevant factors. The commission shall approve, reject, or amend the 12 monthly gas cost recovery factors requested by the utility in its gas cost recovery plan. The factors ordered shall be described in fixed dollar amounts per unit of gas, but may include specific amounts contingent on future events, including proceedings of the federal energy regulatory commission or its successor agency.\n\n(7) In its final order in a gas supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the decisions underlying the 5-year forecast filed by a gas utility pursuant to subsection (4). The commission may also indicate any cost items in the 5-year forecast that on the basis of present evidence, the commission would be unlikely to permit the gas utility to recover from its customers in rates, rate schedules, or gas cost recovery factors established in the future.\n\n(8) The commission, on its own motion or the motion of any party, may make a finding and enter a temporary order granting approval or partial approval of a gas cost recovery plan in a gas supply and cost recovery review, after first having given notice to the parties to the review, and after having afforded to the parties to the review a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing. A temporary order made pursuant to this subsection shall be considered a final order for purposes of judicial review.\n\n(9) If the commission has made a final or temporary order in a gas supply and cost review, the utility may each month incorporate in its rates for the period covered by the order any amounts up to the gas cost recovery factors permitted in that order. If the commission has not made a final or temporary order within 3 months of the submission of a complete gas cost recovery plan, or by the beginning of the period covered in the plan, whichever comes later, or if a temporary order has expired without being extended or replaced, then pending an order which determines the gas cost recovery factors, a gas utility may each month adjust its rates to incorporate all or a part of the gas cost recovery factors requested in its plan. Any amounts collected under the gas cost recovery factors before the commission makes its final order shall be subject to prompt refund with interest to the extent that the total amounts collected exceed the total amounts determined in the commission's final order to be reasonable and prudent for the same period of time.\n\n(10) Not less than 3 months before the beginning of the third quarter of the 12-month period, the utility may file a revised gas cost recovery plan which shall cover the remainder of the 12-month period. Upon receipt of the revised gas cost recovery plan, the commission shall reopen the gas supply and cost review. In addition, the commission may reopen the gas supply and cost review on its own motion or on the showing of good cause by any party if at least 6 months have elapsed since the utility submitted its complete filing and if there are at least 60 days remaining in the 12-month period under consideration. A reopened gas supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, and in accordance with subsections (3), (6), (8), and (9).\n\n(11) Not more than 45 days following the last day of each billing month in which a gas cost recovery factor has been applied to customers' bills, the gas utility shall file with the commission a detailed statement for that month of the revenues recorded pursuant to the gas cost recovery factor and the allowance for cost of gas included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the gas utility, and the cost of gas sold. The detailed statement shall be in the manner and form prescribed by the commission. The commission shall establish procedures for insuring that the detailed statement is promptly verified and corrected if necessary.\n\n(12) Not less than once a year, and not later than 3 months after the end of the 12-month period covered by a gas utility's gas cost recovery plan, the commission shall commence a proceeding, to be known as a gas cost reconciliation, as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969. Reasonable discovery shall be permitted before and during the reconciliation proceeding in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning reconciliation issues including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures and the amounts collected pursuant to the clause. At the gas cost reconciliation the commission shall reconcile the revenues recorded pursuant to the gas cost recovery factor and the allowance for cost of gas included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the gas utility with the amounts actually expensed and included in the cost of gas sold by the gas utility. The commission shall consider any issue regarding the reasonableness and prudence of expenses for which customers were charged if the issue could not have been considered adequately at a previously conducted gas supply and cost review.\n\n(13) In its order in a gas cost reconciliation, the commission shall require a gas utility to refund to customers or credit to customers' bills any net amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered in excess of the amounts determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for gas sold, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the gas supply and cost review. Such refunds or credits shall be apportioned among the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines to be reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order refunds or credits in proportion to the excess amounts actually collected from each such customer during the period covered.\n\n(14) In its order in a gas cost reconciliation, the commission shall authorize a gas utility to recover from customers any net amount by which the amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered was less than the amount determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for gas sold, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the gas supply and cost review. For excess costs incurred through actions contrary to the commission's gas supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for gas sold in the 12-month period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the excess expenses were beyond the ability of the utility to control through reasonable and prudent actions. For excess costs incurred through actions consistent with commission's gas supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for gas sold in the 12-month period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates that the excess expenses were reasonable and prudent. Such amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for gas sold shall be apportioned among and charged to the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines to be reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order charges to be made in proportion to the amounts which would have been paid by such customers if the amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for gas sold had been included in the gas cost recovery factors with respect to such customers during the period covered. Charges for such excess amounts shall be spread over a period that the commission determines to be appropriate.\n\n(15) If the commission orders refunds or credits pursuant to subsection (13), or additional charges to customers pursuant to subsection (14), in its final order in a gas cost reconciliation, the refunds, credits, or additional charges shall include interest and shall be apportioned among the utility's customer classes in proportion to their respective usage during the reconciliation period. In determining the interest included in a refund, credit, or additional charge pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall consider, to the extent material and practicable, the time at which the excess recoveries or insufficient recoveries, or both, occurred. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for excess recoveries, refunds, and credits equal to the greater of the average short-term borrowing rate available to the gas utility during the appropriate period, or the authorized rate of return on the common stock of the gas utility during that same period. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for insufficient recoveries and additional charges equal to the average short-term borrowing rate available to the gas utility during the appropriate period.\n\n(16) To avoid undue hardship or unduly burdensome or excessive cost, the commission may exempt a gas utility with fewer than 200,000 customers in the state of Michigan from 1 or more of the procedural provisions of this section or may modify the filing requirements of this section.\n\n(17) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the commission may, upon application by a gas utility, set gas cost recovery factors, in a manner otherwise consistent with this act, in an order resulting from a general rate case. Within 120 days following the effective date of this section, for the purpose of setting gas cost recovery factors, the commission shall permit a gas utility to reopen a general rate case in which a final order was issued within 120 days before or after the effective date of this section or to amend an application or reopen the evidentiary record in a pending general rate case. If the commission sets gas cost recovery factors in an order resulting from a general rate case:\n\n(a) The gas cost recovery factors shall cover a future period of 48 months or the number of months which elapse until the commission orders new gas cost recovery factors in a general rate case, whichever is the shorter period.\n\n(b) Annual reconciliation proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to subsection (12) and if an annual reconciliation proceeding shows a recoverable amount pursuant to subsection (14), the commission shall authorize the gas utility to defer the amount and to accumulate interest on the amount pursuant to subsection (15), and in the next order resulting from a general rate case authorize the utility to recover the amount and interest from its customers in the manner provided in subsection (14).\n\n(c) The gas cost recovery factors shall not be subject to revision pursuant to subsection (10).\n\nHistory:Add. 1982, Act 304, Imd.

      "text": "(1) As used in this act:\n\n(a) \"Long-term firm gas transportation\" means a binding agreement entered into between the electric utility and a natural gas transmission provider for a set period of time to provide firm delivery of natural gas to an electric generation facility.\n\n(b) \"Power supply cost recovery clause\" means a clause in the electric rates or rate schedule of an electric utility that permits the monthly adjustment of rates for power supply to allow the utility to recover the booked costs, including transportation costs, reclamation costs, and disposal and reprocessing costs, of fuel burned by the utility for electric generation and the booked costs of purchased and net interchanged power transactions by the utility incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.\n\n(c) \"Power supply cost recovery factor\" means that element of the rates to be charged for electric service to reflect power supply costs incurred by an electric utility and made pursuant to a power supply cost recovery clause incorporated in the rates or rate schedule of an electric utility.\n\n(2) The public service commission may incorporate a power supply cost recovery clause in the electric rates or rate schedule of an electric utility. Any order incorporating a power supply cost recovery clause shall be as a result of a hearing solely on the question of the inclusion of the clause in the rates or rate schedule. A hearing under this subsection shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, or, pursuant to subsection (18), as a result of a general rate case. Any order incorporating a power supply cost recovery clause shall replace and rescind any previous fuel cost adjustment clause or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause incorporated in the electric rates of the utility upon the effective date of the first power supply cost recovery factor authorized for the utility under its power supply cost recovery clause.\n\n(3) In order to implement the power supply cost recovery clause established under subsection (2), an electric utility annually shall file, pursuant to procedures established by the commission, if any, a complete power supply cost recovery plan describing the expected sources of electric power supply and changes in the cost of power supply anticipated over a future 12-month period specified by the commission and requesting for each of those 12 months a specific power supply cost recovery factor. The utility shall file the plan not later than 3 months before the beginning of the 12-month period covered by the plan. The plan shall describe all major contracts and power supply arrangements entered into by the utility for providing power supply during the specified 12-month period. The description of the major contracts and arrangements shall include the price of fuel, the duration of the contract or arrangement, and an explanation or description of any other term or provision as required by the commission. For gas fuel supply contracts or arrangements, the description shall include whether the supply contracts or arrangements include long-term firm gas transportation and, if not, an explanation of how the utility proposes to ensure reliable and reasonably priced gas fuel supply to its generation facilities during the specified 12-month period. The plan shall also include the utility's evaluation of the reasonableness and prudence of its decisions to provide power supply in the manner described in the plan, in light of its existing sources of electrical generation, and an explanation of the actions taken by the utility to minimize the cost of fuel to the utility.\n\n(4) In order to implement the power supply cost recovery clause established under subsection (2), a utility shall file, contemporaneously with the power supply cost recovery plan required by subsection (3), a 5-year forecast of the power supply requirements of its customers, its anticipated sources of supply, and projections of power supply costs, in light of its existing sources of electrical generation and sources of electrical generation under construction. The forecast shall include a description of all relevant major contracts and power supply arrangements entered into or contemplated by the utility, and any other information the commission may require.\n\n(5) If an electric utility files a power supply cost recovery plan under subsection (3) and a 5-year forecast under subsection (4), the commission shall conduct a proceeding, to be known as a power supply and cost review, for the purpose of evaluating the reasonableness and prudence of the power supply cost recovery plan filed by a utility under subsection (3), and establishing the power supply cost recovery factors to implement a power supply cost recovery clause incorporated in the electric rates or rate schedule of the utility. The power supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287.\n\n(6) In its final order in a power supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the decisions underlying the power supply cost recovery plan filed by an electric utility under subsection (3), and shall approve, disapprove, or amend the power supply cost recovery plan accordingly. In evaluating the decisions underlying the power supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall consider the cost and availability of the electrical generation available to the utility; the cost of short-term firm purchases available to the utility; the availability of interruptible service; the ability of the utility to reduce or to eliminate any firm sales to out-of-state customers if the utility is not a multi-state utility whose firm sales are subject to other regulatory authority; whether the utility has taken all appropriate actions to minimize the cost of fuel; and other relevant factors. The commission shall approve, reject, or amend the 12 monthly power supply cost recovery factors requested by the utility in its power supply cost recovery plan. The factors shall not reflect items the commission could reasonably anticipate would be disallowed under subsection (13). The factors ordered shall be described in fixed dollar amounts per unit of electricity, but may include specific amounts contingent on future events.\n\n(7) In its final order in a power supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the decisions underlying the 5-year forecast filed by a utility under subsection (4). The commission may also indicate any cost items in the 5-year forecast that, on the basis of present evidence, the commission would be unlikely to permit the utility to recover from its customers in rates, rate schedules, or power supply cost recovery factors established in the future.\n\n(8) The commission, on its own motion or the motion of any party, may make a finding and enter a temporary order granting approval or partial approval of a power supply cost recovery plan in a power supply and cost recovery review, after first giving notice to the parties to the review, and after giving the parties to the review a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing. A temporary order made under this subsection is considered a final order for purposes of judicial review.\n\n(9) If the commission has made a final or temporary order in a power supply and cost review, an electric utility may each month incorporate in its rates for the period covered by the order any amounts up to the power supply cost recovery factors permitted in that order. If the commission has not made a final or temporary order within 3 months after the submission of a complete power supply cost recovery plan, or by the beginning of the period covered in the plan, whichever comes later, or if a temporary order has expired without being extended or replaced, then pending an order that determines the power supply cost recovery factors, a utility may each month adjust its rates to incorporate all or a part of the power supply cost recovery factors requested in its plan. Any amounts collected under the power supply cost recovery factors before the commission makes its final order is subject to prompt refund with interest to the extent that the total amounts collected exceed the total amounts determined in the commission's final order to be reasonable and prudent for the same period of time.\n\n(10) Not later than 3 months before the beginning of the third quarter of the 12-month period described in subsection (3), an electric utility may file a revised power supply cost recovery plan that covers the remainder of the 12-month period. Upon receipt of the revised power supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall reopen the power supply and cost review. In addition, the commission may reopen the power supply and cost review on its own motion or on the showing of good cause by any party if at least 6 months have elapsed since the utility submitted its complete filing and if there are at least 60 days remaining in the 12-month period under consideration. A reopened power supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, and in accordance with subsections (3), (6), (8), and (9).\n\n(11) Not later than 45 days after the last day of each billing month in which a power supply cost recovery factor has been applied to customers' bills, an electric utility shall file with the commission a detailed statement for that month of the revenues recorded pursuant to the power supply cost recovery factor and the allowance for cost of power supply included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the utility, and the cost of power supply. The detailed statement shall be in the manner and form prescribed by the commission. The commission shall establish procedures for insuring that the detailed statement is promptly verified and corrected if necessary.\n\n(12) Not less than once a year, and not later than 3 months after the end of the 12-month period covered by an electric utility's power supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall commence a proceeding, to be known as a power supply cost reconciliation, as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission shall permit reasonable discovery before and during the reconciliation proceeding in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning reconciliation issues including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures and the amounts collected pursuant to the clause. At the power supply cost reconciliation the commission shall reconcile the revenues recorded pursuant to the power supply cost recovery factors and the allowance for cost of power supply included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the utility with the amounts actually expensed and included in the cost of power supply by the utility. The commission shall consider any issue regarding the reasonableness and prudence of expenses for which customers were charged if the issue was not considered adequately at a previously conducted power supply and cost review.\n\n(13) In its order in a power supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall do all of the following:\n\n(a) Disallow cost increases resulting from changes in accounting or rate-making expense treatment not previously approved by the commission. The commission may order the utility to pay a penalty of not more than 25% of the amount improperly collected. Costs incurred by the utility for penalty payments shall not be charged to customers.\n\n(b) Not disallow the capacity charges for any facilities for which the electric utility would otherwise have a purchase obligation if the commission has approved capacity charges in a contract with a qualifying facility, as that term is defined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to the public utilities regulatory policies act of 1978, Public Law 95-617, 92 Stat 3117, unless the commission has ordered revised capacity charges upon reconsideration under this subsection. A contract is valid and binding in accordance with its terms, and capacity charges paid pursuant to that contract are recoverable costs of the utility for rate-making purposes notwithstanding that the order approving that contract is later vacated, modified, or otherwise held to be invalid in whole or in part if the order approving the contract has not been stayed or suspended by a competent court within 30 days after the date of the order, or by July 29, 1987 if the order was issued after September 1, 1986 and before June 29, 1987. The commission shall determine the scope and manner of the review of capacity charges for a qualifying facility. Except as to approvals for qualifying facilities granted by the commission before June 1, 1987, proceedings before the commission seeking those approvals shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission, upon its own motion or upon application of any person, may reconsider its approval of capacity charges for a qualifying facility in a contested case hearing after passage of a period necessary for financing the qualifying facility, if both of the following apply:\n\n(i) The commission has first issued an order making a finding based on evidence presented in a contested case that there has been a substantial change in circumstances since the commission's initial approval.\n\n(ii) The commission finding is set forth in a commission order subject to immediate judicial review.\n\nThe financing period for a qualifying facility during which previously approved capacity charges are not subject to commission reconsideration is 17.5 years, beginning with the date of commercial operation, for all qualifying facilities, except that the minimum financing period before reconsideration of the previously approved capacity charges is for the duration of the financing for a qualifying facility that produces electric energy by the use of biomass, waste, wood, hydroelectric, wind, and other renewable resources, or any combination of renewable resources, as the primary energy source.\n\n(c) Disallow net increased costs attributable to a generating plant outage of more than 90 days in duration unless the utility demonstrates by clear and satisfactory evidence that the outage, or any part of the outage, was not caused or prolonged by the utility's negligence or by unreasonable or imprudent management.\n\n(d) Disallow transportation costs attributable to capital investments to develop a utility's capability to transport fuel or relocate fuel at the utility's facilities and disallow unloading and handling expenses incurred after receipt of fuel by the utility.\n\n(e) Disallow the cost of fuel purchased from an affiliated company to the extent that the fuel is more costly than fuel of requisite quality available at or about the same time from other suppliers with whom it would be comparably cost beneficial to deal.\n\n(f) Disallow charges unreasonably or imprudently incurred for fuel not taken.\n\n(g) Disallow additional costs resulting from unreasonably or imprudently renegotiated fuel contracts.\n\n(h) Disallow penalty charges unreasonably or imprudently incurred.\n\n(i) Disallow demurrage charges.\n\n(j) Disallow increases in charges for nuclear fuel disposal unless the utility has received the prior approval of the commission.\n\n(14) In its order in a power supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall require an electric utility to refund to customers or credit to customers' bills any net amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered in excess of the amounts determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for power supply, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the power supply and cost review. The commission shall apportion the refunds or credits among the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines to be reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order refunds or credits in proportion to the excess amounts actually collected from each such customer during the period covered.\n\n(15) In its order in a power supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall authorize an electric utility to recover from customers any net amount by which the amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered was less than the amount determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for power supply, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the power supply and cost review. For excess costs incurred through management actions contrary to the commission's power supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for power supply in the reconciliation period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the excess expenses were beyond the ability of the utility to control through reasonable and prudent actions. For excess costs incurred through management actions consistent with the commission's power supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for power supply in the reconciliation period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates that the level of those expenses resulted from reasonable and prudent management actions. The amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for power supply shall be apportioned among and charged to the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines to be reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order charges to be made in proportion to the amounts that would have been paid by those customers if the amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for cost of power supply had been included in the power supply cost recovery factors with respect to those customers during the period covered. Charges for the excess amounts shall be spread over a period that the commission determines to be appropriate.\n\n(16) If the commission orders refunds or credits under subsection (14), or additional charges to customers under subsection (15), in its final order in a power supply cost reconciliation, the refunds, credits, or additional charges shall include interest. In determining the interest included in a refund, credit, or additional charge under this subsection, the commission shall consider, to the extent material and practicable, the time at which the excess recoveries or insufficient recoveries, or both occurred. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for excess recoveries, refunds, and credits equal to the greater of the average short-term borrowing rate available to the utility during the appropriate period, or the authorized rate of return on the common stock of the utility during that same period. Costs incurred by the utility for refunds and interest on refunds shall not be charged to customers. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for insufficient recoveries and additional charges equal to the average short-term borrowing rate available to the utility during the appropriate period.\n\n(17) To avoid undue hardship or unduly burdensome or excessive cost, the commission may do both of the following:\n\n(a) Exempt an electric utility with fewer than 200,000 customers in this state from 1 or more of the procedural provisions of this section or may modify the filing requirements of this section.\n\n(b) Exempt an energy utility organized as a cooperative corporation under sections 98 to 109 of 1931 PA 327, MCL 450.98 to 450.109, from 1 or more of the provisions of this section.\n\n(18) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the commission may, upon application by an electric utility, set power supply cost recovery factors, in a manner otherwise consistent with this act, in an order resulting from a general rate case. By October 27, 1987, for the purpose of setting power supply cost recovery factors, the commission shall permit an electric utility to reopen a general rate case in which a final order was issued within 120 days before or after June 29, 1987 or to amend an application or reopen the evidentiary record in a pending general rate case. If the commission sets power supply cost recovery factors in an order resulting from a general rate case, all of the following apply:\n\n(a) The power supply cost recovery factors shall cover a future period of 48 months or the number of months that elapse until the commission orders new power supply cost recovery factors in a general rate case, whichever is the shorter period.\n\n(b) The commission shall conduct annual reconciliation proceedings under subsection (12) and if an annual reconciliation proceeding shows a recoverable amount under subsection (15), the commission shall authorize the electric utility to defer the amount and to accumulate interest on the amount under subsection (16), and in the next order resulting from a general rate case authorize the utility to recover the amount and interest from its customers in the manner provided in subsection (15).\n\n(c) The power supply cost recovery factors are not subject to revision under subsection (10).\n\nHistory:Add. 1982, Act 304, Imd.

Thereafter, the utility may make charges in excess of base rates for the cost of power supply pursuant only to subsections (2) and (4). After October 13, 1982, any revenues resulting from an existing fuel cost adjustment clause or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause and recorded for an annual reconciliation period ending before January 1, 1983, by an electric utility are subject to the existing reconciliation proceeding established by the commission for the utility. In this proceeding, the commission shall consider the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures charged pursuant to an existing fuel cost adjustment clause or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause after October 13, 1982. On and after January 1, 1983, all fuel cost and purchased and net interchanged power revenues received by an electric utility, whether included in base rates or collected pursuant to a fuel or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause or a power supply cost recovery clause, are subject to annual reconciliation with the cost of fuel and purchased and net interchanged power. The annual reconciliations shall be conducted in accordance with the reconciliation procedures described in section 6j(12) to (18), including the provisions for refunds, additional charges, deferral and recovery, and shall include consideration by the commission of the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures charged pursuant to any fuel or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause in existence during the period being reconciled. If the utility has a lag correction provision included in its existing adjustment clauses, the commission shall allow any adjustment to rates attributable to that lag correction provision to be implemented for the 3 billing months immediately succeeding the final billing month in which the existing adjustment clauses as operative.\n\n(4) Until the commission approves or disapproves a power supply cost recovery clause in a final commission order in a contested case required by section 6j(2), a utility that had a fuel cost adjustment clause or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause on October 13, 1982 and which has applied for a power supply cost recovery clause under section 6j may adjust its rates under section 6j(3) to (18), to include power supply cost recovery factors.\n\nHistory:Add. 1982, Act 304, Imd.

A utility's proportional share must be calculated by dividing the company's jurisdictional total operating revenues for the preceding year, as stated in its annual report, by the total operating revenues for the preceding year of all energy utility companies serving at least 100,000 customers in this state. The board shall make this amount available for use by the attorney general for the purposes described in subsection (16).\n\n(b) In the case of an energy utility company serving at least 100,000 residential customers in this state, its proportional share of $2,000,000.00 adjusted annually by a factor as provided in subsection (4). This adjusted amount is the new base amount to which the factor provided in subsection (4) is applied in the succeeding year. A utility's proportional share must be calculated by dividing the company's jurisdictional gross revenues from residential tariff sales for the preceding year by the gross revenues from residential tariff sales for the preceding year of all energy utility companies serving at least 100,000 residential customers in this state. This amount must be used for grants under subsection (10).\n\n(c) In the case of an energy utility company serving fewer than 100,000 customers in this state, its proportional share of $100,000.00 adjusted annually by a factor as provided in subsection (4). This adjusted amount is the new base amount to which the factor provided in subsection (4) is applied in the succeeding year. A utility's proportional share must be calculated by dividing the company's jurisdictional total operating revenues for the preceding year, as stated in its annual report, by the total operating revenues for the preceding year of all energy utility companies serving fewer than 100,000 customers in this state. The board shall make this amount available for use by the attorney general for the purposes described in subsection (16).\n\n(d) In the case of an energy utility company serving fewer than 100,000 residential customers in this state, its proportional share of $100,000.00 adjusted annually by a factor as provided in subsection (4). This adjusted amount is the new base amount to which the factor provided in subsection (4) is applied in the succeeding year. A utility's proportional share must be calculated by dividing the company's jurisdictional gross revenues from residential tariff sales for the preceding year by the gross revenues from residential tariff sales for the preceding year of all energy utility companies serving fewer than 100,000 residential customers in this state. This amount must be used for grants under subsection (10).\n\n(3) Payments made by an energy utility under subsection (2)(a) or (c) are operating expenses of the utility that the commission shall permit the utility to charge to its customers. Payments made by a utility under subsection (2)(b) or (d) are operating expenses of the utility that the commission shall permit the utility to charge to its residential customers.\n\n(4) For purposes of subsection (2), the board shall set the factor at a level not to exceed the percentage increase in the index known as the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, select areas, all items indexed, for the Detroit standard metropolitan statistical area, compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, or any successor agency, that has occurred between January of the preceding year and January of the year in which the payment is required to be made. In the event that more than 1 such index is compiled, the index yielding the largest payment is the maximum allowable factor. The board shall advise utilities of the factor.\n\n(5) The remittance requirements of this section do not apply to an energy utility organized as a cooperative corporation under sections 98 to 109 of 1931 PA 327, MCL 450.98 to 450.109, and grants from the fund must not be used to participate in an energy cost recovery proceeding primarily affecting such a utility.\n\n(6) In the event of a dispute between the board and an energy utility about the amount of payment due, the utility shall pay the undisputed amount and, if the utility and the board cannot agree, the board may initiate civil action in the circuit court for Ingham County for recovery of the disputed amount. The commission shall not accept or take action on an application for an energy cost recovery proceeding from an energy utility subject to this section that has not fully paid undisputed remittances required by this section.\n\n(7) The commission shall not accept or take action on an application for an energy cost recovery proceeding from an energy utility subject to this section until 30 days after it has been notified by the board that the board is ready to process grant applications, will transfer funds payable to the attorney general immediately upon the receipt of those funds, and will within 30 days approve grants and remit funds to qualified grant applicants.\n\n(8) The board may accept a gift or grant from any source to be deposited in the fund if the conditions or purposes of the gift or grant are consistent with this section.\n\n(9) The costs of operation and expenses incurred by the board in performing its duties under this section and section 6l, including remuneration to board members, must be paid from the fund. A maximum of 5% of the annual receipts of the fund may be budgeted and used to pay expenses other than grants made under subsection (10).\n\n(10) The net grant proceeds must finance a grant program from which the board may award to an applicant an amount that the board determines shall be used for the purposes set forth in this section.\n\n(11) The board shall create and make available to applicants an application form. Each applicant shall indicate on the application how the applicant meets the eligibility requirements provided for in this section and how the applicant proposes to use a grant from the fund to participate in 1 or more proceedings as authorized in subsection (16) that have been or are expected to be filed. Each applicant shall also identify on the application any additional funds or resources, other than the grant funds being requested, that are to be used to participate in the proceeding for which the grant is being requested and how those funds or resources will be utilized. The board shall receive an application requesting a grant from the fund only from a nonprofit organization or a unit of local government in this state. The board shall consider only applications for grants containing proposals that are consistent with subsections (16) and (17) and that serve the interests of residential utility consumers. The interest of residential consumers includes, but is not limited to, considerations of utility service in this state; the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the utility sector; and the protection of public health, equitable access to energy efficiency, weatherization, efficient electrification measures, programs and services, and clean energy technologies. For purposes of making grants, the board may consider energy conservation, energy waste reduction, demand response, and rate design options to encourage energy conservation, energy waste reduction, and demand response, as well as the maintenance of adequate energy resources. The board shall not consider an application that primarily benefits the applicant or a service provided or administered by the applicant. The board shall not consider an application from a nonprofit organization if 1 of the organization's principal interests or unifying principles is the welfare of a utility or its investors or employees, or the welfare of 1 or more businesses or industries, other than farms not owned or operated by a corporation, that receive utility service ordinarily and primarily for use in connection with the profit-seeking manufacture, sale, or distribution of goods or services. Mere ownership of securities by a nonprofit organization or its members does not disqualify an application submitted by that organization.\n\n(12) The board shall encourage grant making to nonprofits representing environmental justice communities and communities with the highest energy burdens. The board shall also encourage the interests of identifiable types of residential utility consumers whose interests may differ, including various social and economic classes and areas of the state, and if necessary, may make grants to more than 1 applicant whose applications are related to a similar issue to achieve this type of representation. In addition, the board shall consider and balance the following criteria in determining whether to make a grant to an applicant:\n\n(a) Evidence of the applicant's competence, experience, and commitment to advancing the interests of residential utility consumers.\n\n(b) The anticipated involvement of the attorney general in a proceeding and whether activities of the applicant will be duplicative or supplemental to those of the attorney general.\n\n(c) In the case of a nongovernmental applicant, the extent to which the applicant is representative of or has a previous history of advocating the interests of citizens, especially residential utility consumers.\n\n(d) The anticipated effect of the proposal contained in the application on residential utility consumers, including the immediate and long-term impacts of the proposal.\n\n(e) Evidence demonstrating the potential for continuity of effort and the development of expertise in relation to the proposal contained in the application.\n\n(f) The uniqueness or innovativeness of an applicant's position or point of view as it relates to advocating for residential utility consumers concerning energy costs or rates, and the probability and desirability of that position or point of view prevailing.\n\n(13) As an alternative to choosing between 2 or more applications that have similar proposals, the board may invite 2 or more of the applicants to file jointly and award a grant to be managed cooperatively.\n\n(14) The board shall make disbursements pursuant to a grant in advance of an applicant's proposed actions as set forth in the application if necessary to enable the applicant to initiate, continue, or complete the proposed actions.\n\n(15) Any notice to utility customers and the general public of hearings or other state proceedings in which grants from the fund may be used must contain a notice of the availability of the fund and the address of the board.\n\n(16) The annual receipts and interest earned, less administrative costs, may be used only for participation in administrative and judicial proceedings under sections 6a, 6h, 6j, 6s, 6t, 6w, and 10i, and the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211, and in federal administrative and judicial proceedings that directly affect the energy costs or rates paid by energy utility customers in this state. Amounts that have been in the fund more than 12 months may be retained in the fund for future proceedings and any unexpended money in the fund is reserved to fulfill the purposes for which it was appropriated or may be returned to energy utility companies or used to offset their future remittances in proportion to their previous remittances to the fund, as the board and attorney general determine will best serve the interests of consumers.\n\n(17) The following conditions apply to all grants from the fund:\n\n(a) Disbursements from the fund may be used only to advocate the interests of residential energy utility customers concerning energy costs or rates and not for representation of merely individual interests.\n\n(b) The board shall attempt to maintain a reasonable relationship between the payments from a particular energy utility and the benefits to consumers of that utility.\n\n(c) The board shall coordinate the funded activities of grant recipients with those of the attorney general to avoid duplication of effort, particularly as it relates to the hiring of expert witnesses, to promote supplementation of effort, and to maximize the number of hearings and proceedings with intervenor participation.\n\n(18) A recipient of a grant under subsection (10) may use the grant only for the advancement of the proposed action approved by the board, including, but not limited to, costs of staff, hired consultants and counsel, and research.\n\n(19) A recipient of a grant under subsection (10) shall prepare for and participate in all discussions among the parties designed to facilitate settlement or narrowing of the contested issues before a hearing in order to minimize litigation costs for all parties.\n\n(20) A recipient of a grant under subsection (10) shall file a report with the board not later than 90 days following the end of the year or a shorter period for which the grant is made. The report must be made in a form prescribed by the board and is subject to audit by the board. The board shall include each report received under this subsection as part of the board's annual report required under subsection (22). The report under this subsection must include the following information:\n\n(a) An account of all grant expenditures made by the grant recipient. Expenditures must be reported within the following categories:\n\n(i) Employee and contract for services costs.\n\n(ii) Costs of materials and supplies.\n\n(iii) Filing fees and other costs required to effectively represent residential utility consumers as provided in this section.\n\n(b) A detailed list of the regulatory issues raised by the grant recipient and how each issue was determined by the commission, court, or other tribunal.\n\n(c) Any additional information concerning uses of the grant required by the board.\n\n(21) On or before July 1 of each year, the attorney general shall file a report with the house and senate committees on appropriations and the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over energy and utility policy issues. The report must include the following information:\n\n(a) An account of all expenditures made by the attorney general of money received under this section. Expenditures must be reported in the following categories:\n\n(i) Employee and contract for services costs.\n\n(ii) Costs of materials and supplies.\n\n(iii) Filing fees and other costs required to effectively represent utility consumers as provided in this section.\n\n(b) Any additional information concerning uses of the money received under this section required by the committees.\n\n(22) On or before July 1 of each calendar year, the board shall submit a detailed report to the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over energy and utility policy issues regarding the discharge of duties and responsibilities under this section and section 6l during the preceding calendar year.\n\nHistory:Add. 1982, Act 304, Imd.

The restructuring may be independent of any pending case for rate reductions or increases or may be included within any general rate case proceeding. The revenue impact of the restructured rates shall be included and recognized solely within the residential class of customers.\n\n(2) Rates restructured pursuant to this section shall encourage residential energy conservation and shall be based upon cost of service and other relevant factors.\n\n(3) The commission shall ensure that electric utilities do not penalize residential customers for billings which are for more than 31 days of service in any monthly billing period.\n\n(4) The commission shall take steps necessary to inform the public of the advantages of conservation. In addition to requiring the total charges for service to be reflected on a residential customer's bill, the commission shall require electric utilities to print on each residential customer's bill the total amount of electricity used, the rate for each block used by the customer, and the total charge for each block of electrical usage by the customer. All costs incurred by the electric utilities in carrying out the requirements of this subsection shall be included in the cost to serve the residential customer.\n\n(5) This section shall apply only to electric utilities serving more than 200,000 residential customers in this state.\n\nHistory:Add. 1984, Act 49, Imd.

      "text": "(1) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Resource recovery facility\" means a facility that meets all of the following requirements:\n\n(i) Has machinery, equipment, and structures installed for the primary purpose of recovering energy through the incineration of qualified solid waste, qualified landfill gas, or scrap tires.\n\n(ii) Utilizes at least 80% of its total annual fuel input in the form of qualified solid waste, at least 90% of its total annual fuel input in the form of qualified landfill gas, or 90% of its total annual fuel input in the form of scrap tires, exclusive of fuel used for normal start-up and shutdown.\n\n(iii) Is a qualifying facility as defined by the federal energy regulatory commission pursuant to the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978, Public Law 95-617, 92 Stat. 3117.\n\n(b) \"Qualified landfill gas\" means gas reclaimed from a type II landfill as defined in R 299.4105 of the Michigan administrative code.\n\n(c) \"Qualified solid waste\" means solid waste that may be lawfully disposed of in a type II landfill as defined in R 299.4105 of the Michigan administrative code, and which is generated within this state.\n\n(d) \"Scrap tire\", \"scrap tire hauler\", and \"scrap tire processor\" mean those terms as they are defined in part 169 (scrap tires) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.16901 to 324.16909 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.\n\n(2) Public utilities with more than 500,000 customers in this state shall enter into power purchase agreements for the purchase of capacity and energy from resource recovery facilities that incinerate qualified landfill gas; that incinerate qualified solid waste, at least 50.1% of which is generated within the service areas of the public utility; or, subject to the provisions of this section, that incinerate scrap tires, under rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service that, for these facilities, may differ from those negotiated, authorized, or prescribed for purchases from qualifying facilities that are not resource recovery facilities. If a resource recovery facility incinerates scrap tires, or any other tires that are obtained from outside the state, or if more than 50.1% of the scrap tires or other tires are obtained outside the public utility service area, the public utility may in partial satisfaction of its obligation under this subsection purchase capacity and energy from the facility but is not obligated by this act to purchase the facility's capacity and energy. A resource recovery facility that incinerates at least 90% of its total annual fuel input in the form of scrap tires shall accept all scrap tires that first became scrap tires in the state and that are delivered to the facility by a scrap tire processor or a scrap tire hauler. The first 6,000,000 of these scrap tires delivered to the resource recovery facility each year shall be charged a rate not greater than an amount equal to $34.50 per ton, increased each calendar quarter beginning July 1, 1990, by an amount equal to the increase in the all items version of the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers during the prior calendar quarter. Including power purchase agreements executed prior to June 30, 1989, this section does not apply after 120 megawatts of electric resource recovery facility capacity in a utility's service territory have been contracted and entered in commercial operation. Additionally, this section does not apply to more than the first 30 megawatts of scrap tire fueled resource recovery facility capacity in the state that has been contracted and entered in commercial operation. Excluding rate provisions, if 1 or more provisions of a purchase agreement remain in dispute, each party shall submit to the commission all of the purchase agreement provisions of their last best offer and a supporting brief. On each disputed provision, the commission shall within 60 days either select or reject with recommendation the offers submitted by either party.\n\n(3) A power purchase agreement entered into by a public utility for the purchase of capacity and energy from a resource recovery facility shall be filed with the commission and a contested case proceeding shall commence immediately pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.271 to 24.287 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Notwithstanding section 6j, a power purchase agreement shall be considered approved if the commission does not approve or disapprove the agreement within 6 months of the date of the filing of the agreement. Approval pursuant to this subsection constitutes prior approval under section 6j(13)(b).\n\n(4) The energy rate component of all power sales contracts for resource recovery facilities shall be equal to the avoided energy cost of the purchasing utility.\n\n(5) When averaged over the term of the contract, the capacity rate component of all power sales contracts for resource recovery facilities may be equal to but not less than the full avoided cost of the utility as determined by the commission. In determining the capacity rate, the commission may assume that the utility needs capacity.\n\n(6) Capacity purchased by a utility prior to January 1, 2000 under a power sales contract with a resource recovery facility shall not be considered directly or indirectly in determining the utility's reserve margin, reserve capacity, or other resource capability measurement. To insure compliance with this act, a resource recovery facility that incinerates scrap tires shall provide an annual accounting to the legislature and the commission. The annual accounting shall include the total amount of scrap tires incinerated at the resource recovery facility and the percentage of those scrap tires that prior to incineration were used within this state for their original intended purpose.\n\nHistory:Add. 1989, Act 2, Imd.

The plan shall also include the utility's evaluation of the reasonableness and prudence of its decisions to provide steam supply in the manner described in the plan, in light of its existing sources of steam generation, and an explanation of the actions taken by the utility to minimize the cost of fuel to the utility.\n\n(4) In order to implement the steam supply cost recovery clause established pursuant to subsection (2), a utility shall file, contemporaneously with the steam supply cost recovery plan required by subsection (3), a 3-year forecast of the steam supply requirements of its customers, its anticipated sources of supply, and projections of steam supply costs, in light of its existing sources of steam generation and sources of steam generation under construction. The forecast shall include a description of all relevant major contracts and steam supply arrangements entered into or contemplated by the utility, and any other information the commission may require.\n\n(5) If a utility files a steam supply cost recovery plan and a 3-year forecast as provided in subsections (3) and (4), the commission shall conduct a proceeding, to be known as a steam supply and cost review, to evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the steam supply cost recovery plan filed by a utility pursuant to subsection (3), and establish the steam supply cost recovery factors to implement a steam supply cost recovery clause incorporated in the rates or rate schedule of the utility. The steam supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287.\n\n(6) In its final order in a steam supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the decisions underlying the steam supply cost recovery plan filed by the utility pursuant to subsection (3), and shall approve, disapprove, or amend the steam supply cost recovery plan accordingly. In evaluating the decisions underlying the steam supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall consider the cost and availability of the steam generation available to the utility, the cost of short-term firm purchases available to the utility, whether the utility has taken all appropriate actions to minimize the cost of fuel, and other relevant factors. The commission shall approve, reject, or amend the 12 monthly steam supply cost recovery factors requested by the utility in its steam supply cost recovery plan. The factors ordered shall be described in fixed dollar amounts per unit of steam, but may include specific amounts contingent on future events.\n\n(7) In its final order in a steam supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the decisions underlying the 3-year forecast filed by a utility pursuant to subsection (4). The commission may also indicate any cost items in the 3-year forecast that, on the basis of present evidence, the commission would be unlikely to permit the utility to recover from its customers in rates, rate schedules, or steam supply cost recovery factors established in the future.\n\n(8) The commission, on its own motion or the motion of any party, may make a finding and enter a temporary order granting approval or partial approval of a steam supply cost recovery plan in a steam supply and cost recovery review after first having given notice to the parties to the review and giving those parties a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing. A temporary order made pursuant to this subsection is considered a final order for purposes of judicial review.\n\n(9) If the commission has made a final or temporary order in a steam supply and cost review, the utility may each month incorporate in its rates for the period covered by the order any amount up to the steam supply cost recovery factors permitted in that order. If the commission has not made a final or temporary order within 3 months of the submission of a complete steam supply cost recovery plan, or by the beginning of the period covered in the plan, whichever comes later, or if a temporary order has expired without being extended or replaced, then, pending an order which determines the steam supply cost recovery factors, a utility may each month adjust its rates to incorporate all or a part of the steam supply cost recovery factors requested in its plan. Any amount collected under the steam supply cost recovery factors before the commission makes its final order shall be subject to prompt refund with interest to the extent that the total amount collected exceeds the total amount determined in the commission's final order to be reasonable and prudent for the same period of time.\n\n(10) Not less than 3 months before the beginning of the third quarter of the 12-month period, a utility may file a revised steam supply cost recovery plan which shall cover the remainder of the 12-month period. Upon receipt of a revised steam supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall reopen the steam supply and cost review. In addition, the commission may reopen the steam supply and cost review on its own motion or on the showing of good cause by any party if at least 6 months have elapsed since the utility submitted its complete filing and if there are at least 60 days remaining in the 12-month period under consideration. A reopened steam supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, and in accordance with subsections (3), (6), (8), and (9).\n\n(11) Not more than 45 days following the last day of each billing month in which a steam supply cost recovery factor has been applied to customers' bills, a utility shall file with the commission a detailed statement for that month of the revenues recorded pursuant to the steam supply cost recovery factor and the allowance for cost of steam supply included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the utility, and the cost of steam supply. The detailed statement shall be in the manner and form prescribed by the commission. The commission shall establish procedures for insuring that the detailed statement is promptly verified and corrected if necessary.\n\n(12) Not less than once a year, and not later than 3 months after the end of the 12-month period covered by a utility's steam supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall commence a proceeding, to be known as a steam supply cost reconciliation, as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. Reasonable discovery shall be permitted before and during the reconciliation proceeding in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning reconciliation issues, including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures and the amounts collected pursuant to the clause. At the steam supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall reconcile the revenues recorded pursuant to the steam supply cost recovery factors and the allowance for cost of steam supply included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the utility with the amounts actually expensed and included in the cost of steam supply by the utility. The commission shall consider any issue regarding the reasonableness and prudence of expenses for which customers were charged if the issue was not considered adequately at a previously conducted steam supply and cost review.\n\n(13) In its order in a steam supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall require a utility to refund to customers or credit to customers' bills any net amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered in excess of the amounts determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for steam supply, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the steam supply and cost review. The refunds or credits shall be apportioned among the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines are reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order refunds or credits in proportion to the excess amounts actually collected from each customer during the period covered.\n\n(14) In its order in a steam supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover from customers any net amount by which the amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered was less than the amount determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for steam supply, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the steam supply and cost review. For excess costs incurred through management actions contrary to the commission's steam supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for steam supply in the reconciliation period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the excess expenses were beyond the ability of the utility to control through reasonable and prudent actions. For excess costs incurred through management actions consistent with the commission's steam supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for steam supply in the reconciliation period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates that the level of the expenses resulted from reasonable and prudent management actions. The amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for steam supply shall be apportioned among and charged to the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines are reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order charges to be made in proportion to the amounts which would have been paid by those customers if the amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for cost of steam supply had been included in the steam supply cost recovery factors with respect to those customers during the period covered. Charges for the excess amounts shall be spread over a period that the commission determines is appropriate.\n\n(15) If the commission orders refunds or credits pursuant to subsection (13), or additional charges to customers pursuant to subsection (14), in its final order in a steam supply cost reconciliation, the refunds, credits, or additional charges shall include interest. In determining the interest included in a refund, credit, or additional charge pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall consider, to the extent material and practicable, the time at which the excess recoveries or insufficient recoveries, or both, occurred. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for excess recoveries, refunds, and credits equal to the greater of the average short-term borrowing rate available to the utility during the appropriate period, or the authorized rate of return on the common stock of the utility during that same period. Costs incurred by the utility for refunds and interest on refunds shall not be charged to customers. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for insufficient recoveries and additional charges equal to the average short-term borrowing rate available to the utility during the appropriate period.\n\n(16) The commission shall file a report with the governor and legislature 5 years after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, and every 5 years thereafter, that shall include recommendations for any needed legislation regarding this section.\n\nHistory:Add. 2008, Act 132, Imd.

      "text": "(1) An electric utility that proposes to construct an electric generation facility, make a significant investment in an existing electric generation facility, purchase an existing electric generation facility, or enter into a power purchase agreement for the purchase of electric capacity for a period of 6 years or longer may submit an application to the commission seeking a certificate of necessity for that construction, investment, or purchase if that construction, investment, or purchase costs $100,000,000.00 or more and a portion of the costs would be allocable to retail customers in this state. A significant investment in an electric generation facility includes a group of investments reasonably planned to be made over a multiple year period not to exceed 6 years for a singular purpose such as increasing the capacity of an existing electric generation plant. The commission shall not issue a certificate of necessity under this section for any environmental upgrades to existing electric generation facilities. If the application is for the construction of an electric generation facility of 225 megawatts or more or for the construction of an additional generating unit or units totaling 225 megawatts or more at an existing electric generation facility submitted as required under section 6t(13), the commission shall consolidate its proceedings under section 6t and this section. If the commission approves or denies an application for an electric generation facility under this section that has been submitted as required under section 6t(13), the provisions of this section prevail in a conflict with section 6t.\n\n(2) The commission may implement separate review criteria and approval standards for electric utilities with less than 1,000,000 retail customers that seek a certificate of necessity for projects costing less than $100,000,000.00.\n\n(3) An electric utility submitting an application under this section may request 1 or more of the following:\n\n(a) A certificate of necessity that the power to be supplied as a result of the proposed construction, investment, or purchase is needed.\n\n(b) A certificate of necessity that the size, fuel type, and other design characteristics of the existing or proposed electric generation facility or the terms of the power purchase agreement represent the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting that power need.\n\n(c) A certificate of necessity that the price specified in the power purchase agreement will be recovered in rates from the electric utility's customers.\n\n(d) A certificate of necessity that the estimated purchase or capital costs of and the financing plan for the existing or proposed electric generation facility, including, but not limited to, the costs of siting and licensing a new facility and the estimated cost of power from the new or proposed electric generation facility, will be recoverable in rates from the electric utility's customers subject to subsection (4)(c).\n\n(4) Within 270 days after the filing of an application under this section, or, for an application for an electric generation facility submitted as required under section 6t(13), concurrently with a final order issued under section 6t, the commission shall issue an order granting or denying the requested certificate of necessity. The commission shall hold a hearing on the application. The hearing shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission may allow intervention by persons under the rules of practice and procedure of the commission and shall allow intervention by existing suppliers of electric generation capacity under subsection (13), persons allowed to intervene in the contested case under section 6t, and interested persons. The commission shall permit reasonable discovery before and during the hearing in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning the application, including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of the construction, investment, or purchase for which the certificate of necessity has been requested. The commission shall grant the request if it determines all of the following:\n\n(a) That the electric utility has demonstrated a need for the power that would be supplied by the existing or proposed electric generation facility or pursuant to the proposed power purchase agreement through its approved integrated resource plan under section 6t or subsection (11).\n\n(b) The information supplied indicates that the existing or proposed electric generation facility will comply with all applicable state and federal environmental standards, laws, and rules.\n\n(c) The estimated cost of power from the existing or proposed electric generation facility or the price of power specified in the proposed power purchase agreement is reasonable. The commission shall find that the cost is reasonable if, in the construction or investment in a new or existing facility, to the extent it is commercially practicable, the estimated costs are the result of competitively bid engineering, procurement, and construction contracts, or in a power purchase agreement, the cost is the result of a competitive solicitation. Up to 150 days after an electric utility makes its initial filing, it may file to update its cost estimates if they have materially changed. No other aspect of the initial filing may be modified unless the application is withdrawn and refiled. A utility's filing updating its cost estimates does not extend the period for the commission to issue an order granting or denying a certificate of necessity. An affiliate of an electric utility that serves customers in this state and at least 1 other state may participate in the competitive bidding to provide engineering, procurement, and construction services to that electric utility for a project covered by this section.\n\n(d) The existing or proposed electric generation facility or proposed power purchase agreement represents the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting the power need relative to other resource options for meeting power demand, including energy efficiency programs, electric transmission efficiencies, and any alternative proposals submitted under this section by existing suppliers of electric generation capacity under subsection (13) or other intervenors.\n\n(e) To the extent practicable, the construction or investment in a new or existing facility in this state is completed using a workforce composed of residents of this state as determined by the commission. This subdivision does not apply to a facility that is located in a county that lies on the border with another state.\n\n(5) The commission may consider any other costs or information related to the costs associated with the power that would be supplied by the existing or proposed electric generation facility or pursuant to the proposed purchase agreement or alternatives to the proposal raised by intervening parties.\n\n(6) In a certificate of necessity under this section, the commission shall specify the costs approved for the construction of or significant investment in the electric generation facility, the price approved for the purchase of the existing electric generation facility, or the price approved for the purchase of power pursuant to the terms of the power purchase agreement. For power purchase agreements that an electric utility enters into with an entity that is not affiliated with that electric utility after the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t, the commission shall consider and may authorize a financial incentive for that utility that does not exceed the electric utility's weighted average cost of capital.\n\n(7) The utility shall annually file, or more frequent if required by the commission, reports to the commission regarding the status of any project for which a certificate of necessity has been granted under subsection (4), including an update concerning the cost and schedule of that project.\n\n(8) If the commission denies any of the relief requested by an electric utility, the electric utility may withdraw its application or proceed with the proposed construction, purchase, investment, or power purchase agreement without a certificate and the assurances granted under this section.\n\n(9) Once the electric generation facility or power purchase agreement is considered used and useful or as otherwise provided in subsection (12), the commission shall include in an electric utility's retail rates all reasonable and prudent costs for an electric generation facility or power purchase agreement for which a certificate of necessity has been granted. The commission shall not disallow recovery of costs an electric utility incurs in constructing, investing in, or purchasing an electric generation facility or in purchasing power pursuant to a power purchase agreement for which a certificate of necessity has been granted, if the costs do not exceed the costs approved by the commission in the certificate. The portion of the cost of a plant, facility, or power purchase agreement that exceeds the cost approved by the commission is presumed to have been incurred due to a lack of prudence. Once the electric generation facility or power purchase agreement is considered used and useful or as otherwise provided in subsection (12), the commission shall include in the electric utility's retail rates costs actually incurred by the electric utility that exceed the costs approved by the commission only if the commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the additional costs were prudently incurred. The commission shall disallow costs the commission finds have been incurred as the result of fraud, concealment, gross mismanagement, or lack of quality controls amounting to gross mismanagement. The commission shall also require refunds with interest to ratepayers of any of these costs already recovered through the electric utility's rates and charges. If the assumptions underlying an approved certificate of necessity, other than a certificate of necessity approved for a power purchase agreement for the purchase of electric capacity, materially change, an electric utility may request, or the commission on its own motion may initiate, a proceeding to review whether it is reasonable and prudent to complete an unfinished project for which a certificate of necessity has been granted. If the commission finds that completion of the project is no longer reasonable and prudent, the commission may modify or cancel approval of the certificate of necessity. Except for costs the commission finds an electric utility has incurred as the result of fraud, concealment, gross mismanagement, or lack of quality controls amounting to gross mismanagement, if commission approval is modified or canceled, the commission shall not disallow reasonable and prudent costs already incurred or committed to by contract by an electric utility. Once the commission finds that completion of the project is no longer reasonable and prudent, the commission may limit future cost recovery to those costs that could not be reasonably avoided.\n\n(10) The commission shall adopt standard application filing forms and instructions for use in all requests for a certificate of necessity under this section. The commission may modify the standard application filing forms and instructions adopted under this section.\n\n(11) The commission shall establish standards for an integrated resource plan that shall be filed by an electric utility requesting a certificate of necessity under this section. This subsection does not apply to an electric utility that has an approved integrated resource plan under section 6t. An integrated resource plan shall include all of the following:\n\n(a) A long-term forecast of the electric utility's load growth under various reasonable scenarios.\n\n(b) The type of generation technology proposed for the generation facility and the proposed capacity of the generation facility, including projected fuel and regulatory costs under various reasonable scenarios.\n\n(c) Projected energy and capacity purchased or produced by the electric utility under any renewable portfolio standard.\n\n(d) Projected energy efficiency program savings under any energy efficiency program requirements and the projected costs for that program.\n\n(e) Projected load management and demand response savings for the electric utility and the projected costs for those programs.\n\n(f) An analysis of the availability and costs of other electric resources that could defer, displace, or partially displace the proposed generation facility or purchased power agreement, including additional renewable energy, energy efficiency programs, load management, and demand response, beyond those amounts contained in subdivisions (c) to (e).\n\n(g) Electric transmission options for the electric utility.\n\n(12) The commission may allow financing interest cost recovery in an electric utility's base rates on construction work in progress for capital improvements approved under this section prior to the assets being considered used and useful. Regardless of whether or not the commission authorizes base rate treatment for construction work in progress financing interest expense, an electric utility shall be allowed to recognize, accrue, and defer the allowance for funds used during construction.\n\n(13) An existing supplier of electric generation capacity currently producing at least 200 megawatts of firm electric generation capacity resources located in the independent system operator's zone in which the utility's load is served that seeks to provide electric generation capacity resources to the utility may submit a written proposal directly to the commission as an alternative to the construction, investment, or purchase for which the certificate of necessity is sought under this section. The entity submitting an alternative proposal under this subsection has standing to intervene and the commission shall allow reasonable discovery in the contested case proceeding conducted under this section. In evaluating an alternative proposal, the commission shall consider the cost of the alternative proposal and the submitting entity's qualifications, technical competence, capability, reliability, creditworthiness, and past performance. In reviewing an application, the commission may consider any alternative proposals submitted under this subsection. This subsection does not limit the ability of any other person to submit to the commission an alternative proposal to the construction, investment, or purchase for which a certificate of necessity is sought under this section and to petition for and be granted leave to intervene in the contested case proceeding conducted under this section under the rules of practice and procedure of the commission. This subsection does not authorize the commission to order or otherwise require an electric utility to adopt any alternative proposal submitted under this subsection.\n\n(14) An order of the commission following a hearing under this section is subject to judicial review as provided under section 28 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963 and chapter 6 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.301 to 24.306, except that the filing of a petition for review must be filed in the court of appeals within 30 days after the order of the commission is issued and the court shall conduct the review as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters.\n\nHistory:Add. 2008, Act 286, Imd.

The assessment must expressly account for advanced metering infrastructure that has already been installed in this state and seek to fully maximize potential benefits to ratepayers in lowering utility bills.\n\n(c) Identify significant state or federal environmental regulations, laws, or rules and how each regulation, law, or rule would affect electric utilities in this state.\n\n(d) Identify any formally proposed state or federal environmental regulation, law, or rule that has been published in the Michigan Register or the Federal Register and how the proposed regulation, law, or rule would affect electric utilities in this state.\n\n(e) Identify any required planning reserve margins and local clearing requirements in areas of this state.\n\n(f) Establish the modeling scenarios and assumptions each electric utility should include in addition to its own scenarios and assumptions in developing its integrated resource plan filed under subsection (3), including, but not limited to, all of the following:\n\n(i) Any required planning reserve margins and local clearing requirements.\n\n(ii) All applicable state and federal environmental regulations, laws, and rules identified in this subsection.\n\n(iii) Any supply-side and demand-side resources that reasonably could address any need for additional generation capacity, including, but not limited to, the type of generation technology for any proposed generation facility, projected energy waste reduction savings, projected load impact due to electrification, and projected load management and demand response savings.\n\n(iv) Any regional infrastructure limitations in this state.\n\n(v) The projected costs of different types of technologies and fuel used for electric generation.\n\n(g) Allow other state agencies to provide input regarding any other regulatory requirements that should be included in modeling scenarios or assumptions.\n\n(h) Publish a copy of the proposed modeling scenarios and assumptions to be used in integrated resource plans on the commission's website.\n\n(i) Before issuing the final modeling scenarios and assumptions each electric utility should include in developing its integrated resource plan, receive written comments and hold hearings to solicit public input regarding the proposed modeling scenarios and assumptions.\n\n(j) Conduct an assessment of the potential for electrification of transportation, buildings, and industries consistent with economy-wide elimination of greenhouse gas emissions in this state, based on what is economically and technically feasible, as well as what is reasonably achievable.\n\n(k) Identify environmental justice communities.\n\n(2) A proceeding commenced under subsection (1) must be completed within 120 days, and is not a contested case under chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288. The determination of the modeling assumptions for integrated resource plans made under subsection (1) is not considered a final order for purposes of judicial review. The determinations made under subsection (1) are only subject to judicial review as part of the final commission order approving an integrated resource plan under this section.\n\n(3) Not later than April 20, 2019, each electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission shall file with the commission an integrated resource plan that provides a 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year projection of the utility's load obligations and a plan to meet those obligations, to meet the utility's requirements to provide generation reliability, including meeting planning reserve margin and local clearing requirements determined by the commission or the appropriate independent system operator, and to meet all applicable state and federal reliability and environmental regulations over the ensuing term of the plan. The commission shall issue an order establishing filing requirements, including application forms and instructions, and filing deadlines for an integrated resource plan filed by an electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission. The electric utility's plan may include alternative modeling scenarios and assumptions in addition to those identified under subsection (1).\n\n(4) For an electric utility with fewer than 1,000,000 customers in this state whose rates are regulated by the commission, the commission may issue an order implementing separate filing requirements, review criteria, and approval standards that differ from those established under subsection (3). An electric utility providing electric tariff service to customers both in this state and in at least 1 other state may design its integrated resource plan to cover all its customers on that multistate basis. If an electric utility has filed a multistate integrated resource plan that includes its service area in this state with the relevant utility regulatory commission in another state in which it provides tariff service to retail customers, the commission shall accept that integrated resource plan filing for filing purposes in this state. However, the commission may require supplemental information if necessary as part of its evaluation and determination of whether to approve the plan. Upon request of an electric utility, the commission may adjust the filing dates for a multistate integrated resource plan filing in this state to place its review on the same timeline as other relevant state reviews.\n\n(5) An integrated resource plan must include all of the following:\n\n(a) A long-term forecast of the electric utility's sales and peak demand under various reasonable scenarios.\n\n(b) The type of generation technology proposed for a generation facility contained in the plan and the proposed capacity of the generation facility, including projected fuel costs under various reasonable scenarios.\n\n(c) Projected energy purchased or produced by the electric utility from a renewable energy resource. If the level of renewable energy purchased or produced is projected to drop over the planning periods set forth in subsection (3), the electric utility must demonstrate why the reduction is in the best interest of ratepayers.\n\n(d) An analysis of how the electric utility's plan complies with the renewable energy plan requirements and goals of section 28 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1028, the clean energy requirements of section 51 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1051, the energy waste reduction measures in section 77 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1077, and the energy storage target of section 101 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1101.\n\n(e) Projected load management and demand response savings for the electric utility and the projected costs for those programs.\n\n(f) Projected energy and capacity purchased or produced by the electric utility from a cogeneration resource.\n\n(g) An analysis of potential new or upgraded electric transmission options for the electric utility.\n\n(h) Data regarding the utility's current generation portfolio, including the age, capacity factor, licensing status, and remaining estimated time of operation for each facility in the portfolio.\n\n(i) Plans for meeting current and future capacity needs with the cost estimates for all proposed construction and major investments, including any transmission or distribution infrastructure that would be required to support the proposed construction or investment, and power purchase agreements.\n\n(j) An analysis of the cost, capacity factor, and viability of all reasonable options available to meet projected energy and capacity needs, including, but not limited to, existing electric generation facilities in this state.\n\n(k) Projected rate and affordability impact for the periods covered by the plan.\n\n(l) How the utility will comply with all applicable state and federal environmental regulations, laws, and rules, and the projected costs of complying with those regulations, laws, and rules.\n\n(m) A forecast of the utility's peak demand and details regarding the amount of peak demand reduction the utility expects to achieve and the actions the utility proposes to take in order to achieve that peak demand reduction.\n\n(n) The projected long-term firm gas transportation contracts or natural gas storage the electric utility will hold to provide an adequate supply of natural gas to any new generation facility.\n\n(o) The projected long-term forecast of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants from power generated or purchased by the electric utility. The electric utility may include details on the broader emissions impact of shifting to electrification of transportation, buildings, and industries.\n\n(p) An environmental justice impact analysis that includes a review of the reasonably anticipated environmental justice impacts for any plan that includes the construction of a new natural-gas-fired generation facility and an analysis of whether the facility complies with the requirements for clean energy systems established in the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211. If a plan proposes retiring or retaining 1 or more fossil fuel peaking plants, in an environmental justice community, a review of the reasonably anticipated environmental justice impacts for each generation facility.\n\n(6) Before filing an integrated resource plan under this section, each electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission shall issue a request for proposals to provide any new supply-side generation capacity resources needed to serve the utility's reasonably projected electric load, applicable planning reserve margin, and local clearing requirement for its customers in this state and customers the utility serves in other states during the initial 3-year planning period to be considered in each integrated resource plan to be filed under this section. An electric utility shall define qualifying performance standards, contract terms, technical competence, capability, reliability, creditworthiness, past performance, and other criteria that responses and respondents to the request for proposals must meet in order to be considered by the utility in its integrated resource plan to be filed under this section. Respondents to a request for proposals may request that certain proprietary information be exempt from public disclosure as allowed by the commission. A utility that issues a request for proposals under this subsection shall use the resulting proposals to inform its integrated resource plan filed under this section and include all of the submitted proposals as attachments to its integrated resource plan filing regardless of whether the proposals met the qualifying performance standards, contract terms, technical competence, capability, reliability, creditworthiness, past performance, or other criteria specified for the utility's request for proposals under this section. An existing supplier of electric generation capacity currently producing at least 200 megawatts of firm electric generation capacity resources located in the independent system operator's zone in which the utility's load is served that seeks to provide electric generation capacity resources to the utility may submit a written proposal directly to the commission as an alternative to any supply-side generation capacity resource included in the electric utility's integrated resource plan submitted under this section, and has standing to intervene in the contested case proceeding conducted under this section. This subsection does not require an entity that submits an alternative under this subsection to submit an integrated resource plan. This subsection does not limit the ability of any other person to submit to the commission an alternative proposal to any supply-side generation capacity resource included in the electric utility's integrated resource plan submitted under this section and to petition for and be granted leave to intervene in the contested case proceeding conducted under this section under the rules of practice and procedure of the commission. The commission shall only consider an alternative proposal submitted under this subsection as part of its approval process under subsection (8). The electric utility submitting an integrated resource plan under this section is not required to adopt any proposals submitted under this subsection. To the extent practicable, each electric utility is encouraged, but not required, to partner with other electric providers in the same local resource zone as the utility's load is served in the development of any new supply-side generation capacity resources included as part of its integrated resource plan.\n\n(7) Not later than 300 days after an electric utility files an integrated resource plan under this section, the commission shall state if the commission has any recommended changes, and if so, describe them in sufficient detail to allow their incorporation in the integrated resource plan. If the commission does not recommend changes, it shall issue a final, appealable order approving or denying the plan filed by the electric utility. If the commission recommends changes, the commission shall set a schedule allowing parties at least 15 days after that recommendation to file comments regarding those recommendations, and allowing the electric utility at least 30 days to consider the recommended changes and submit a revised integrated resource plan that incorporates 1 or more of the recommended changes. If the electric utility submits a revised integrated resource plan under this section, the commission shall issue a final, appealable order approving the plan as revised by the electric utility or denying the plan. The commission shall issue a final, appealable order no later than 360 days after an electric utility files an integrated resource plan under this section. Up to 150 days after an electric utility makes its initial filing, the electric utility may file to update its cost estimates if those cost estimates have materially changed. A utility shall not modify any other aspect of the initial filing unless the utility withdraws and refiles the application. A utility's filing updating its cost estimates does not extend the period for the commission to issue an order approving or denying the integrated resource plan. The following are applicable to an integrated resource plan filed under this section:\n\n(a) The commission shall do all of the following:\n\n(i) Review the integrated resource plan in a contested case proceeding conducted in accordance with chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288.\n\n(ii) Allow intervention by interested persons including electric customers of the utility, respondents to the utility's request for proposals under this section, or other parties approved by the commission.\n\n(iii) Request an advisory opinion from the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy regarding all of the following:\n\n(A) Whether any potential decrease in emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, mercury, and particulate matter would reasonably be expected to result if the integrated resource plan proposed by the electric utility under subsection (3) was approved.\n\n(B) Whether the integrated resource plan can reasonably be expected to achieve compliance with the regulations, laws, or rules identified in subsection (1).\n\n(C) The potential impacts of proposed energy generation resources and of any prudent and feasible alternatives identified by the department on whether the plan makes adequate progress toward achieving the clean energy standard established in section 51 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1051.\n\n(D) The potential impacts of the plan and of any prudent and feasible alternatives identified by the department on whether the plan makes adequate progress toward the economy-wide virtual elimination of greenhouse gas emissions in this state by 2050.\n\n(E) Whether the plan in comparison to any prudent and feasible alternatives makes adequate progress toward the elimination of adverse effects on human health due to power generation in this state.\n\n(F) Whether the plan in comparison to any prudent and feasible alternatives adequately reduces harms to the health, safety, and welfare of individuals in environmental justice communities.\n\n(b) The commission may do 1 or both of the following:\n\n(i) Take official notice of the opinion issued by the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy under this subsection pursuant to R 792.10428 of the Michigan Administrative Code. Information submitted by the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy under this subsection is advisory and is not binding on future determinations by the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy or the commission in any proceeding or permitting process. This section does not prevent an electric utility from applying for, or receiving, any necessary permits from the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy.\n\n(ii) Invite other state agencies to provide testimony regarding other relevant regulatory requirements related to the integrated resource plan. The commission shall permit reasonable discovery after an integrated resource plan is filed and during the hearing in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning the integrated resource plan, including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of the plan and alternatives to the plan raised by intervening parties.\n\n(8) The commission shall approve the integrated resource plan under subsection (7) if the commission determines all of the following:\n\n(a) The proposed integrated resource plan represents the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting the electric utility's energy and capacity needs. To determine whether the integrated resource plan is the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting energy and capacity needs, the commission shall consider whether the plan appropriately balances all of the following factors:\n\n(i) Resource adequacy and capacity to serve anticipated peak electric load, applicable planning reserve margin, and local clearing requirement.\n\n(ii) Compliance with applicable state and federal environmental regulations.\n\n(iii) Competitive pricing.\n\n(iv) Reliability.\n\n(v) Commodity price risks.\n\n(vi) Diversity of generation supply.\n\n(vii) Whether the proposed levels of peak load reduction and energy waste reduction are reasonable and cost-effective.\n\n(viii) Affordability.\n\n(ix) Overall cost-effectiveness in providing utility service.\n\n(b) To the extent practicable, the construction or investment in a new or existing capacity resource in this state is completed using a workforce composed of residents of this state as determined by the commission. This subdivision does not apply to a capacity resource that is located in a county that lies on the border with another state.\n\n(c) The construction and construction maintenance of new or the rehabilitation of existing capacity resources in this state includes using an apprenticeship program registered and certified with the United States Secretary of Labor under the national apprenticeship act, 29 USC 50 to 50c, and the workers employed for the construction or construction maintenance of the energy facility are paid a minimum wage standard not less than the wage and fringe benefit rates prevailing in the locality in which the work is to be performed as determined under 2023 PA 10, MCL 408.1101 to 408.1126, or 40 USC 3141 to 3148, whichever provides the higher wage and fringe benefit rates, and, to the extent permitted by law, the entities performing the construction or construction maintenance work shall enter into a project labor agreement or operate under a collective bargaining agreement for the work to be performed. This subdivision does not apply to an independent power producer supplying power under a contract or agreement entered into in accordance with the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978, Public Law 95-617, as of the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subdivision. As used in this subdivision, \"project labor agreement\" means a prehire collective bargaining agreement with 1 or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and does all of the following:\n\n(i) Binds all contractors and subcontractors on the construction project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents.\n\n(ii) Allows all contractors and subcontractors on the construction project to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements.\n\n(iii) Contains guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions.\n\n(iv) Sets forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project labor agreement.\n\n(v) Provides other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work, safety, and health.\n\n(vi) Complies with all state and federal laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n(d) The plan is consistent with the renewable energy plan requirements and goals of section 28 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1028, the clean energy requirements of section 51 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1051, the energy waste reduction measures in section 77 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1077, and the energy storage target of section 101 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1101.\n\n(e) The plan promotes environmental quality and public health and reasonably mitigates adverse effects on human health due to power generation, with a priority on mitigating impacts and prioritizing benefits to communities disproportionately impacted by pollution and other environmental harms.\n\n(f) The plan meets the requirements of subsection (5).\n\n(9) If the commission denies a utility's integrated resource plan, the utility, within 60 days after the date of the final order denying the integrated resource plan, may submit revisions to the integrated resource plan to the commission for approval. The commission shall commence a new contested case hearing under chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288. Not later than 90 days after the date that the utility submits the revised integrated resource plan to the commission under this subsection, the commission shall issue an order approving or denying, with recommendations, the revised integrated resource plan if the revisions are not substantial or inconsistent with the original integrated resource plan filed under this section. If the revisions are substantial or inconsistent with the original integrated resource plan, the commission has up to 150 days to issue an order approving or denying, with recommendations, the revised integrated resource plan.\n\n(10) If the commission denies an electric utility's integrated resource plan, the electric utility may proceed with a proposed construction, purchase, investment, or power purchase agreement contained in the integrated resource plan without the assurances granted under this section.\n\n(11) In approving an integrated resource plan under this section, the commission shall specify the costs approved for the construction of or significant investment in an electric generation or energy storage facility, the purchase of an existing electric generation or energy storage facility, the purchase of power under the terms of the power purchase or energy storage agreement, or other investments or resources used to meet energy and capacity needs that are included in the approved integrated resource plan. The costs for specifically identified investments, including the costs for facilities under subsection (12), included in an approved integrated resource plan that are commenced within 3 years after the commission's order approving the initial plan, amended plan, or plan review are considered reasonable and prudent for cost recovery purposes.\n\n(12) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (13), for a new electric generation or energy storage facility approved in an integrated resource plan that is to be owned by the electric utility and that is commenced within 3 years after the commission's order approving the plan, the commission shall finalize the approved costs for the electric generation or energy storage facility only after the utility has done all of the following and filed the results, analysis, and recommendations with the commission:\n\n(a) Implemented a competitive bidding process for all major engineering, procurement, and construction contracts associated with the construction of the electric generation or energy storage facility.\n\n(b) Implemented a competitive bidding process that allows third parties to submit firm and binding bids for the construction of an electric generation or energy storage facility on behalf of the utility that would meet all of the technical, commercial, and other specifications required by the utility for the generation or energy storage facility, such that ownership of the electric generation or energy storage facility vests with the utility no later than the date the electric generation or energy storage facility becomes commercially available.\n\n(c) Demonstrated to the commission that the finalized costs for the new electric generation or energy storage facility are not significantly higher than the initially approved costs under subsection (11). If the finalized costs are found to be significantly higher than the initially approved costs, the commission shall review and approve the proposed costs if the commission determines those costs are reasonable and prudent.\n\n(13) If the capacity resource under subsection (12) is for the construction of an electric generation facility of 225 megawatts or more or for the construction of an additional generating unit or units totaling 225 megawatts or more at an existing electric generation facility, the utility shall submit an application to the commission seeking a certificate of necessity under section 6s.\n\n(14) An electric utility shall annually, or more frequently if required by the commission, file reports to the commission regarding the status of any projects included in the initial 3-year period of an integrated resource plan approved under subsection (7).\n\n(15) If an electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission enters into a purchase power agreement for renewable energy resources or a third-party contract for energy storage systems or clean energy systems with an entity that is not affiliated with that utility, the commission shall authorize a financial incentive for that utility calculated as the product of contract payments in that year multiplied by the electric provider's pretax weighted average cost of permanent capital comprised of long-term debt obligations and equity of the electric provider's total capital structure as determined by the commission's final order in the electric provider's most recent general rate case. The pretax weighted average cost of permanent capital used to calculate the financial incentive must not be fixed throughout the entire term of the contract at the pretax weighted average cost of capital applicable in the first year and must be updated based on the commission's final order in each succeeding general rate case for the electric provider. The financial incentive applies to each contract described in this subsection from the date the contract is executed for the entire term of the contract. This subsection applies to any contract entered into after June 30, 2024.\n\n(16) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an order by the commission approving an integrated resource plan may be reviewed by the court of appeals upon a filing by a party to the commission proceeding within 30 days after the order is issued. All appeals of the order must be heard and determined as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters. Review on appeal is based solely on the record before the commission and briefs to the court and is limited to whether the order conforms to the constitution and laws of this state and the United States and is within the authority of the commission under this act.\n\n(17) The commission shall include in an electric utility's retail rates all reasonable and prudent costs specified under subsections (11) and (12) that have been incurred to implement an integrated resource plan approved by the commission. The commission shall not disallow recovery of costs an electric utility incurs in implementing an approved integrated resource plan, if the costs do not exceed the costs approved by the commission under subsections (11) and (12). If the actual costs incurred by the electric utility exceed the costs approved by the commission, the electric utility has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the costs are reasonable and prudent. The portion of the cost of a plant, facility, power purchase agreement, or other investment in a resource that meets a demonstrated need for capacity that exceeds the cost approved by the commission is presumed to have been incurred due to a lack of prudence. The commission may include any or all of the portion of the cost in excess of the cost approved by the commission if the commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the costs are reasonable and prudent. The commission shall disallow costs the commission finds have been incurred as the result of fraud, concealment, gross mismanagement, or lack of quality controls amounting to gross mismanagement. The commission shall also require refunds with interest to ratepayers of any of these costs already recovered through the electric utility's rates and charges. If the assumptions underlying an approved integrated resource plan materially change, or if the commission believes it is unlikely that a project or program will become commercially operational, an electric utility may request, or the commission on its own motion may initiate, a proceeding to review whether it is reasonable and prudent to complete an unfinished project or program included in an approved integrated resource plan. If the commission finds that completion of the project or program is no longer reasonable and prudent, the commission may modify or cancel approval of the project or program and unincurred costs in the electric utility's integrated resource plan. Except for costs the commission finds an electric utility has incurred as the result of fraud, concealment, gross mismanagement, or lack of quality controls amounting to gross mismanagement, if commission approval is modified or canceled, the commission shall not disallow reasonable and prudent costs already incurred or committed to by contract by an electric utility. Once the commission finds that completion of the project or program is no longer reasonable and prudent, the commission may limit future cost recovery to those costs that could not be reasonably avoided.\n\n(18) The commission may allow financing interest cost recovery in an electric utility's base rates on construction work in progress for capital improvements approved under this section prior to the assets' being considered used and useful. Regardless of whether or not the commission authorizes base rate treatment for construction work in progress financing interest expense, an electric utility may recognize, accrue, and defer the allowance for funds used during construction.\n\n(19) An electric utility may seek to amend an approved integrated resource plan. Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the commission shall consider the amendments under the same process and standards that govern the review and approval of a revised integrated resource plan under subsection (9). The commission may order an electric utility that seeks to amend an approved integrated resource plan under this subsection to file a plan review under subsection (21).\n\n(20) An electric utility shall file an application for review of its integrated resource plan not later than 5 years after the effective date of the most recent commission order approving a plan, a plan amendment, or a plan review. The commission shall consider a plan review under the same process and standards established in this section for review and approval of an integrated resource plan. A commission order approving a plan review has the same effect as an order approving an integrated resource plan.\n\n(21) The commission may, on its own motion or at the request of the electric utility, order an electric utility to file a plan review. The department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy may request the commission to order a plan review to address material changes in environmental regulations and requirements that occur after the commission's approval of an integrated resource plan. An electric utility must file a plan review within 270 days after the commission orders the utility to file a plan review.\n\n(22) As used in this section, \"long-term firm gas transportation\" means a binding agreement entered into between the electric utility and a natural gas transmission provider for a set period of time to provide firm delivery of natural gas to an electric generation facility.\n\nHistory:Add. 2016, Act 341, Eff.

U-6798, to implement title II, section 210, of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978, as it relates to qualifying facilities from which utilities in this state have an obligation to purchase energy and capacity. Nothing in this section supersedes the provisions of PURPA or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations and orders implementing PURPA.\n\n(2) In setting rates for avoided costs, the commission shall take into consideration the factors regarding avoided costs set forth in PURPA and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations and orders implementing PURPA.\n\n(3) After an initial contested case under subsection (1), for a utility serving less than 1,000,000 electric customers in this state, the commission may conduct any periodic reevaluations of the procedures, rate schedules, and avoided cost rates for that utility using notice and comment procedures instead of a full contested case. The commission shall conduct the periodic reevaluation in a contested case under chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, if a qualifying facility files a comment disputing the utility filing and requesting a contested case.\n\n(4) An order issued by the commission under subsection (1) shall do all of the following:\n\n(a) Ensure that the rates for purchases by an electric utility from, and rates for sales to, a qualifying facility shall, over the term of a contract, be just and reasonable and in the public interest, as defined by PURPA.\n\n(b) Ensure that an electric utility does not discriminate against a qualifying facility with respect to the conditions or price for provision of maintenance power, backup power, interruptible power, and supplementary power or for any other service.\n\n(c) Require that any prices charged by an electric utility for maintenance power, backup power, interruptible power, and supplementary power and all other such services are cost-based and just and reasonable.\n\n(d) Establish a schedule of avoided cost price updates for each electric utility.\n\n(e) Require electric utilities to publish on their websites template contracts for power purchase agreements for qualifying facilities of less than 3 megawatts that need not include terms for either price or duration of the contract. The terms of a template contract published under this subsection are not binding on either an electric utility or a qualifying facility and may be negotiated and altered upon agreement between an electric utility and a qualifying facility.\n\n(5) Within 1 year after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, and every 2 years thereafter, the commission shall issue a report to the Michigan agency for energy and the standing committees of the senate and house of representatives with primary responsibility for energy and environmental issues.

      "text": "(1) If the appropriate independent system operator receives approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to implement a resource adequacy tariff that provides for a capacity forward auction, and includes the option for a state to implement a prevailing state compensation mechanism for capacity, then the commission shall examine whether the prevailing state compensation mechanism would be more cost-effective, reasonable, and prudent than the capacity forward auction for this state before the commission may order the prevailing state compensation mechanism to be implemented in any utility service territory in which the prevailing state compensation mechanism is not yet effective. Before the commission orders the implementation of the prevailing state compensation mechanism in 1 or more utility service territories, the commission shall hold a contested case hearing pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission shall allow intervention by interested persons, alternative electric suppliers, and customers of alternative electric suppliers and the utility under consideration. At the conclusion of the proceeding, the commission shall make a finding for each utility service territory under consideration, based on clear and convincing evidence, as to whether or not the prevailing state compensation mechanism would be more cost-effective, reasonable, and prudent than the use of the capacity forward auction for this state in meeting the local clearing requirement and the planning reserve margin requirement. The contested case must be scheduled for completion by December 1 before the independent system operator's capacity forward auction for this state, and the commission's decision shall identify which utility service territories will be subject to the prevailing state compensation mechanism. If the commission implements the prevailing state compensation mechanism, it shall implement the prevailing state compensation mechanism for a minimum of 4 consecutive planning years unless such period conflicts with the federal tariff. The commission shall establish the charge as a capacity charge under subsection (3) and determine that charge consistent with the approved resource adequacy tariff of the appropriate independent system operator.\n\n(2) If the appropriate independent system operator receives approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to implement a resource adequacy tariff that provides for a capacity forward auction, and does not include the option for a state to implement a prevailing state compensation mechanism for capacity, then the commission shall examine whether a state reliability mechanism established under subsection (8) would be more cost-effective, reasonable, and prudent than the capacity forward auction for this state before the commission may order the state reliability mechanism to be implemented in any utility service territory. Before the commission orders the implementation of the state reliability mechanism in 1 or more utility service territories, the commission shall hold a contested case hearing pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission shall allow intervention by interested persons, alternative electric suppliers, and customers of alternative electric suppliers and the utility under consideration. At the conclusion of the proceeding, the commission shall make a finding for each utility service territory under consideration, based on clear and convincing evidence, as to whether or not the state reliability mechanism would be more cost-effective, reasonable, and prudent than the use of the capacity forward auction for this state in meeting the local clearing requirement and the planning reserve margin requirement. The contested case must be scheduled for completion by December 1 before the independent system operator's capacity forward auction for this state, and the commission's decision shall identify which utility service territories will be subject to the state reliability mechanism. If, by September 30, 2017, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does not put into effect a resource adequacy tariff that includes a capacity forward auction or a prevailing state compensation mechanism, then the commission shall establish a state reliability mechanism under subsection (8). The commission may commence a proceeding before October 1 if the commission believes orderly administration would be enabled by doing so. If the commission implements a state reliability mechanism, it shall be for a minimum of 4 consecutive planning years beginning in the upcoming planning year. A state reliability charge must be established in the same manner as a capacity charge under subsection (3) and be determined consistent with subsection (8).\n\n(3) After the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t, the commission shall establish a capacity charge as provided in this section. A determination of a capacity charge must be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, after providing interested persons with notice and a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing and conclude by December 1 of each year. The commission shall allow intervention by interested persons, alternative electric suppliers, and customers of alternative electric suppliers and the utility under consideration. The commission shall provide notice to the public of the single capacity charge as determined for each territory. No new capacity charge is required to be paid before June 1, 2018. The capacity charge must be applied to alternative electric load that is not exempt as set forth under subsections (6) and (7). If the commission elects to implement a capacity forward auction for this state as set forth in subsection (1) or (2), then a capacity charge shall not apply beginning in the first year that the capacity forward auction for this state is effective. In order to ensure that noncapacity electric generation services are not included in the capacity charge, in determining the capacity charge, the commission shall do both of the following and ensure that the resulting capacity charge does not differ for full service load and alternative electric supplier load:\n\n(a) For the applicable term of the capacity charge, include the capacity-related generation costs included in the utility's base rates, surcharges, and power supply cost recovery factors, regardless of whether those costs result from utility ownership of the capacity resources or the purchase or lease of the capacity resource from a third party.\n\n(b) For the applicable term of the capacity charge, subtract all non-capacity-related electric generation costs, including, but not limited to, costs previously set for recovery through net stranded cost recovery and securitization and the projected revenues, net of projected fuel costs, from all of the following:\n\n(i) All energy market sales.\n\n(ii) Off-system energy sales.\n\n(iii) Ancillary services sales.\n\n(iv) Energy sales under unit-specific bilateral contracts.\n\n(4) The commission shall provide for a true-up mechanism that results in a utility charge or credit for the difference between the projected net revenues described in subsection (3) and the actual net revenues reflected in the capacity charge. The true-up shall be reflected in the capacity charge in the subsequent year. The methodology used to set the capacity charge shall be the same methodology used in the true-up for the applicable planning year.\n\n(5) Not less than once every year, the commission shall review or amend the capacity charge in all subsequent rate cases, power supply cost recovery cases, or separate proceedings established for that purpose.\n\n(6) A capacity charge shall not be assessed for any portion of capacity obligations for each planning year for which an alternative electric supplier can demonstrate that it can meet its capacity obligations through owned or contractual rights to any resource that the appropriate independent system operator allows to meet the capacity obligation of the electric provider. The preceding sentence shall not be applied in any way that conflicts with a federal resource adequacy tariff, when applicable. Any electric provider that has previously demonstrated that it can meet all or a portion of its capacity obligations shall give notice to the commission by September 1 of the year 4 years before the beginning of the applicable planning year if it does not expect to meet that capacity obligation and instead expects to pay a capacity charge. The capacity charge in the utility service territory must be paid for the portion of its load taking service from the alternative electric supplier not covered by capacity as set forth in this subsection during the period that any such capacity charge is effective.\n\n(7) An electric provider shall provide capacity to meet the capacity obligation for the portion of that load taking service from an alternative electric supplier in the electric provider's service territory that is covered by the capacity charge during the period that any such capacity charge is effective. The alternative electric supplier has the obligation to provide capacity for the portion of the load for which the alternative electric supplier has demonstrated an ability to meet its capacity obligations. If an alternative electric supplier ceases to provide service for a portion or all of its load, it shall allow, at a cost no higher than the determined capacity charge, the assignment of any right to that capacity in the applicable planning year to whatever electric provider accepts that load.\n\n(8) If a state reliability mechanism is required to be established under subsection (2), the commission shall do all of the following:\n\n(a) Require, by December 1 of each year, that each electric utility demonstrate to the commission, in a format determined by the commission, that for the planning year beginning 4 years after the beginning of the current planning year, the electric utility owns or has contractual rights to sufficient capacity to meet its capacity obligations as set by the appropriate independent system operator, or commission, as applicable.\n\n(b) Require, by the seventh business day of February each year, that each alternative electric supplier, cooperative electric utility, or municipally owned electric utility demonstrate to the commission, in a format determined by the commission, that for the planning year beginning 4 years after the beginning of the current planning year, the alternative electric supplier, cooperative electric utility, or municipally owned electric utility owns or has contractual rights to sufficient capacity to meet its capacity obligations as set by the appropriate independent system operator, or commission, as applicable. One or more municipally owned electric utilities may aggregate their capacity resources that are located in the same local resource zone to meet the requirements of this subdivision. One or more cooperative electric utilities may aggregate their capacity resources that are located in the same local resource zone to meet the requirements of this subdivision. A cooperative or municipally owned electric utility may meet the requirements of this subdivision through any resource, including a resource acquired through a capacity forward auction, that the appropriate independent system operator allows to qualify for meeting the local clearing requirement. A cooperative or municipally owned electric utility's payment of an auction price related to a capacity deficiency as part of a capacity forward auction conducted by the appropriate independent system operator does not by itself satisfy the resource adequacy requirements of this section unless the appropriate independent system operator can directly tie that provider's payment to a capacity resource that meets the requirements of this subsection. By the seventh business day of February in 2018, an alternative electric supplier shall demonstrate to the commission, in a format determined by the commission, that for the planning year beginning June 1, 2018, and the subsequent 3 planning years, the alternative electric supplier owns or has contractual rights to sufficient capacity to meet its capacity obligations as set by the appropriate independent system operator, or commission, as applicable. If the commission finds an electric provider has failed to demonstrate it can meet a portion or all of its capacity obligation, the commission shall do all of the following:\n\n(i) For alternative electric load, require the payment of a capacity charge that is determined, assessed, and applied in the same manner as under subsection (3) for that portion of the load not covered as set forth in subsections (6) and (7). If a capacity charge is required to be paid under this subdivision in the planning year beginning June 1, 2018 or any of the 3 subsequent planning years, the capacity charge is applicable for each of those planning years.\n\n(ii) For a cooperative or municipally owned electric utility, recommend to the attorney general that suit be brought consistent with the provisions of subsection (9) to require that procurement.\n\n(iii) For an electric utility, require any audits and reporting as the commission considers necessary to determine if sufficient capacity is procured. If an electric utility fails to meet its capacity obligations, the commission may assess appropriate and reasonable fines, penalties, and customer refunds under this act.\n\n(c) In order to determine the capacity obligations, request that the appropriate independent system operator provide technical assistance in determining the local clearing requirement and planning reserve margin requirement. If the appropriate independent system operator declines, or has not made a determination by October 1 of that year, the commission shall set any required local clearing requirement and planning reserve margin requirement, consistent with federal reliability requirements.\n\n(d) In order to determine if resources put forward will meet such federal reliability requirements, request technical assistance from the appropriate independent system operator to assist with assessing resources to ensure that any resources will meet federal reliability requirements. If the technical assistance is rendered, the commission shall accept the appropriate independent system operator's determinations unless it finds adequate justification to deviate from the determinations related to the qualification of resources. If the appropriate independent system operator declines, or has not made a determination by February 28, the commission shall make those determinations.\n\n(9) The attorney general or any customer of a municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility may commence a civil action for injunctive relief against that municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility if the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility fails to meet the applicable requirements of subsection (8)(b). The attorney general or customer shall commence an action under this subsection in the circuit court for the county in which the principal office of the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility is located. The attorney general or customer shall not file an action under this subsection unless the attorney general or customer gives the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility at least 60 days' written notice of the intent to sue, the basis for the suit, and the relief sought. Within 30 days after the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility receives written notice of the intent to sue, the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility and the attorney general or customer shall meet and make a good-faith attempt to determine if there is a credible basis for the action. The municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility shall take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of subsection (8)(b) within 90 days after the meeting if there is a credible basis for the action. If the parties do not agree as to whether there is a credible basis for the action, the attorney general or customer may proceed to file the suit.\n\n(10) The commission shall adjust the dates under this section if needed to ensure proper alignment with the appropriate independent system operator's procedures and requirements. However, any changes to the dates in this section must ensure that providers still meet applicable reliability requirements. The commission shall not permit a capacity charge to be assessed under this section for any year in which it has elected the capacity forward auction instead of the prevailing state compensation mechanism or the state reliability mechanism.\n\n(11) Nothing in this act shall prevent the commission from determining a generation capacity charge under the reliability assurance agreement, rate schedule FERC No. 44 of the independent system operator known as PJM Interconnection, LLC, as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in docket no. ER10-2710 or similar successor tariff.\n\n(12) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Appropriate independent system operator\" means the Midcontinent Independent System Operator.\n\n(b) \"Capacity forward auction\" means an auction-based resource adequacy construct and the associated tariffs developed by the appropriate independent system operator for at least a portion of this state for 3 years forward or more.\n\n(c) \"Electric provider\" means any of the following:\n\n(i) Any person or entity that is regulated by the commission for the purpose of selling electricity to retail customers in this state.\n\n(ii) A municipally owned electric utility in this state.\n\n(iii) A cooperative electric utility in this state.\n\n(iv) An alternative electric supplier licensed under section 10a.\n\n(d) \"Local clearing requirement\" means the amount of capacity resources required to be in the local resource zone in which the electric provider's demand is served to ensure reliability in that zone as determined by the appropriate independent system operator for the local resource zone in which the electric provider's demand is served and by the commission under subsection (8).\n\n(e) \"Planning reserve margin requirement\" means the amount of capacity equal to the forecasted coincident peak demand that occurs when the appropriate independent system operator footprint peak demand occurs plus a reserve margin that meets an acceptable loss of load expectation as set by the commission or the appropriate independent system operator under subsection (8).\n\n(f) \"Planning year\" means June 1 through the following May 31 of each year.\n\n(g) \"Prevailing state compensation mechanism\" means an option for a state to elect a prevailing compensation rate for capacity consistent with the requirements of the appropriate independent system operator's resource adequacy tariff.\n\n(h) \"State reliability mechanism\" means a plan adopted by the commission in the absence of a prevailing state compensation mechanism to ensure reliability of the electric grid in this state consistent with subsection (8).\n\nHistory:Add. 2016, Act 341, Eff.

The department of health and human services, in consultation with the commission, shall ensure that all money collected for the fund from a geographic area is returned, to the extent possible, to that geographic area and ensure the fund is administered to promote all of the following:\n\n(a) Statewide access to the Michigan energy assistance program established in section 3 of the Michigan energy assistance act, 2012 PA 615, MCL 400.1233, ensuring that funds collected from a specific geographic area are, to the extent possible, returned to eligible low-income customers in that specific geographic area.\n\n(b) Collaboration between the department of health and human services, the commission, energy providers, and entities that administer assistance programs to ensure that, to the extent possible, eligible low-income customers in a geographic area are receiving funds proportional to what customers in that geographic area are being assessed.\n\n(c) For energy providers and entities that administer assistance programs, education and outreach on availability of the assistance programs and funding.\n\n(6) Beginning March 1, 2027, and by each March 1 thereafter, the department of health and human services shall provide to the house and senate appropriations subcommittee for the department of health and human services budget and the house and senate standing committees on energy a report that contains all of the following information:\n\n(a) The distribution of money from the fund across this state.\n\n(b) A summary of total funds received and assistance awarded for each county in this state.\n\n(c) A summary of the education, marketing, and outreach to improve the distribution of funds.\n\n(7) The department of health and human services may combine the report required under subsection (6) with the report required under section 3 of the Michigan energy assistance act, 2012 PA 615, MCL 400.1233.\n\n(8) Subject to the limitations imposed in this subsection, the commission may, after an opportunity to comment, annually approve a low-income energy assistance funding factor no later than May 1 of each year for the subsequent fiscal year. The low-income energy assistance funding factor must be the same across all customer classes. Before the effective date of the 2024 amendatory act that amended this section, the low-income energy assistance funding factor must not exceed a cap of $1.00. Beginning on the effective date of the 2024 amendatory act that amended this section, the commission may increase the low-income energy assistance funding factor to $1.25 and by not more than $0.25 each year thereafter. Subject to this subsection, the low-income energy assistance funding factor must not exceed a cap of $2.00. Beginning in 2029, and each year thereafter, the commission shall adjust the cap on the low-income energy assistance funding factor by the percentage increase in the United States Consumer Price Index for the immediately preceding calendar year.

The notice filed by the utility must include the total number of retail billing meters the utility serves in this state that would be subject to the low-income energy assistance funding factor if the utility were not opting out. The utility shall provide the number of retail billing meters to the commission as both a total of retail billing meters in the utility's service territory and a total of billing meters by county.\n\n(10) An electric utility, municipally owned electric utility, or cooperative electric utility that opts out under subsection (9) must establish and fund an energy assistance program for its residential customers that provides assistance to its residential customers for both their electric and home heating needs consistent with the eligibility requirements of the Michigan energy assistance program established in section 3 of the Michigan energy assistance act, 2012 PA 615, MCL 400.1233. An electric utility, municipally owned utility, or cooperative electric utility shall ensure that the funds available for energy assistance programs established under this subsection are sufficient to provide assistance to all eligible customers who apply, but the utility is not required to spend more for an energy assistance program than what the utility would have collected from the low-income energy assistance funding factor if the utility did not opt out under subsection (9). Beginning October 1, 2025, and annually thereafter, an electric utility, municipally owned utility, or cooperative electric utility that opts out under subsection (9) shall provide notice to its residential customers of available energy assistance provided by the utility. The notice must include a description of the program, eligibility guidelines, application information, and a statement that the utility's assistance program is offered instead of collecting the low-income energy assistance factor. The utility shall include information regarding the assistance program on its website. Beginning December 1, 2026, and annually thereafter, an electric utility, municipally owned utility, or cooperative electric utility that opts out under subsection (9) shall submit to the commission a report that contains the following information:\n\n(a) The total amount of funds available for energy assistance for the utility's customers.\n\n(b) The total number of the utility's customers, by county, that applied for energy assistance through the utility program.\n\n(c) The total number of the utility's customers, by county, that received assistance.\n\n(d) The total amount of assistance provided to the utility's customers, by county, including a description of the amount of assistance provided for each home heating commodity.\n\n(e) Any other information the commission considers necessary to demonstrate compliance with this subsection.\n\n(11) The commission may develop a template that utilities may use to meet the reporting requirements of subsection (10).\n\n(12) The attorney general or a customer of a municipally owned utility or cooperative electric utility that opts out under subsection (9) may commence a civil action for injunctive relief against the municipally owned utility or cooperative electric utility if that utility fails to meet the requirements of this section.

The attorney general or customer shall not file an action under this subsection unless the attorney general or customer has given the utility at least 60 days' written notice of the intent to sue, the basis for the suit, and the relief sought. Not later than 30 days after the utility receives written notice of the intent to sue, the utility and the attorney general or customer shall meet and make a good-faith attempt to determine if there is a credible basis for the action. The utility shall take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of this section within 90 days after the meeting if there is a credible basis for the action. If the parties do not agree as to whether there is a credible basis for the action, the attorney general or customer may proceed to file the suit.

      "text": "(1) The commission shall issue orders establishing the rates, terms, and conditions of service that allow retail customers to take service from an alternative electric supplier. The orders shall do all of the following:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, provide that no more than 10% of an electric utility's average weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year may take service from an alternative electric supplier at any time.\n\n(b) Set forth procedures necessary to allocate the amount of load that will be allowed to be served by alternative electric suppliers, through the use of annual energy allotments awarded on a calendar year basis. If the sales of a utility are less in a subsequent year or if the energy usage of a customer receiving electric service from an alternative electric supplier exceeds its annual energy allotment for that facility, that customer shall not be forced to purchase electricity from a utility, but may purchase electricity from an alternative electric supplier for that facility during that calendar year.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, provide that, if the commission determines that less than 10% of an electric utility's average weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year is taking service from alternative electric suppliers, the commission shall set as a cap on the weather-adjusted retail sales that may take service from an alternative electric supplier, for the current calendar year and 5 subsequent calendar years, the percentage amount of weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year rounded up to the nearest whole percentage. If the cap is not adjusted for 6 consecutive calendar years, the cap shall return to 10% in the calendar year following that sixth consecutive calendar year. If a utility that serves less than 200,000 customers in this state has not had any load served by an alternative electric supplier in the preceding 4 years, the commission shall adjust the cap in accordance with this provision for no more than 2 consecutive calendar years.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, customers seeking to expand usage at a facility that has been continuously served through an alternative electric supplier since April 1, 2008 shall be permitted to purchase electricity from an alternative electric supplier for both the existing and any expanded load at that facility as well as any new facility constructed or acquired after October 6, 2008 that is similar in nature if the customer owns more than 50% of the new facility.\n\n(e) Provide that for an existing facility that is receiving 100% of its electric service from an alternative electric supplier on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t, the owner of that facility may purchase electricity from an alternative electric supplier, regardless of whether the sales exceed 10% of the servicing electric utility's average weather-adjusted retail sales, for both the existing electric choice load at that facility and any expanded load arising after the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t at that facility as well as any new facility that is similar in nature to the existing facility, that is constructed or acquired by the customer on a site contiguous to the existing site or on a site that would be contiguous to an existing site in the absence of an existing public right-of-way, and the customer owns more than 50% of that facility. This subdivision does not authorize or permit an existing facility being served by an electric utility on standard tariff service on the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t to be served by an alternative electric supplier.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any customer operating an iron ore mining facility, iron ore processing facility, or both, located in the Upper Peninsula of this state, may purchase all or any portion of its electricity from an alternative electric supplier, regardless of whether the sales exceed 10% of the serving electric utility's average weather-adjusted retail sales, if that customer is in compliance with the terms of a settlement agreement requiring it to facilitate construction of a new power plant located in the Upper Peninsula of this state. A customer described in this subdivision and the alternative electric supplier that provides electric service to that customer are not subject to the requirements contained in the amendatory act that added section 6t and any administrative regulations adopted under that amendatory act. The commission's orders establishing rates, terms, and conditions of retail access service issued before the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t remain in effect with regard to retail open access provided under this subdivision.\n\n(g) Provide that a customer on an enrollment queue waiting to take retail open access service as of December 31, 2015 shall continue on the queue and an electric utility shall add a new customer to the queue if the customer's prospective alternative electric supplier submits an enrollment request to the electric utility. A customer shall be removed from the queue by notifying the electric utility electronically or in writing.\n\n(h) Require each electric utility to file with the commission not later than January 15 of each year a rank-ordered queue of all customers awaiting retail open access service under subdivision (g). The filing must include the estimated amount of electricity used by each customer awaiting retail open access service under subdivision (g). All customer-specific information contained in the filing under this subdivision is exempt from release under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246, and the commission shall treat that information as confidential information. The commission may release aggregated information as part of its annual report as long as individual customer information or data are not released.\n\n(i) Provide that if the prospective alternative electric supplier of a customer next on the queue awaiting retail open access service is notified after the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t that less than 10% of an electric utility's average weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year are taking service from an alternative electric supplier and that the amount of electricity needed to serve the customer's electric load is available under the 10% allocation, the customer may take service from an alternative electric supplier. The customer's prospective alternative electric supplier shall notify the electric utility within 5 business days after being notified whether the customer will take service from an alternative electric supplier. If the customer's prospective alternative electric supplier fails to notify the utility within 5 business days or if the customer chooses not to take retail open access service, the customer shall be removed from the queue of those awaiting retail open access service. The customer may subsequently be added to the queue as a new customer under the provisions of subdivision (g). A customer that elects to take service from an alternative electric supplier under this subdivision shall become service-ready under rules established by the commission and the utility's approved retail open access service tariffs.\n\n(j) Provide that the commission shall ensure if a customer is notified that the customer's service from an alternative electric supplier will be terminated or restricted as a result of the alternative electric supplier limiting service in this state, the customer has 60 days to acquire service from a different alternative electric supplier. If the customer is a public entity, the time to acquire services from a different alternative electric supplier shall not be less than 180 days.\n\n(k) Provide that as a condition of licensure, an alternative electric supplier meets all of the requirements of this act.\n\n(2) The commission shall issue orders establishing a licensing procedure for all alternative electric suppliers. To ensure adequate service to customers in this state, the commission shall require that an alternative electric supplier maintain an office within this state, shall assure that an alternative electric supplier has the necessary financial, managerial, and technical capabilities, shall require that an alternative electric supplier maintain records that the commission considers necessary, and shall ensure an alternative electric supplier's accessibility to the commission, to consumers, and to electric utilities in this state. The commission also shall require alternative electric suppliers to agree that they will collect and remit to local units of government all applicable users, sales, and use taxes. An alternative electric supplier is not required to obtain any certificate, license, or authorization from the commission other than as required by this act.\n\n(3) The commission shall issue orders to ensure that customers in this state are not switched to another supplier or billed for any services without the customer's consent.\n\n(4) This act does not prohibit or limit the right of a person to obtain self-service power and does not impose a transition, implementation, exit fee, or any other similar charge on self-service power. A person using self-service power is not an electric supplier, electric utility, or a person conducting an electric utility business. As used in this subsection, \"self-service power\" means any of the following:\n\n(a) Electricity generated and consumed at an industrial site or contiguous industrial site or single commercial establishment or single residence without the use of an electric utility's transmission and distribution system.\n\n(b) Electricity generated primarily by the use of by-product fuels, including waste water solids, which electricity is consumed as part of a contiguous facility, with the use of an electric utility's transmission and distribution system, but only if the point or points of receipt of the power within the facility are not greater than 3 miles distant from the point of generation.\n\n(c) A site or facility with load existing on June 5, 2000 that is divided by an inland body of water or by a public highway, road, or street but that otherwise meets this definition meets the contiguous requirement of this subdivision regardless of whether self-service power was being generated on June 5, 2000.\n\n(d) A commercial or industrial facility or single residence that meets the requirements of subdivision (a) or (b) meets this definition whether or not the generation facility is owned by an entity different from the owner of the commercial or industrial site or single residence.\n\n(5) This act does not prohibit or limit the right of a person to engage in affiliate wheeling and does not impose a transition, implementation, exit fee, or any other similar charge on a person engaged in affiliate wheeling.\n\n(6) The rights of parties to existing contracts and agreements in effect as of January 1, 2000 between electric utilities and qualifying facilities, including the right to have the charges recovered from the customers of an electric utility, or its successor, are not abrogated, increased, or diminished by this act, nor shall the receipt of any proceeds of the securitization bonds by an electric utility be a basis for any regulatory disallowance. Further, any securitization or financing order issued by the commission that relates to a qualifying facility's power purchase contract shall fully consider that qualifying facility's legal and financial interests.\n\n(7) A customer that elects to receive service from an alternative electric supplier may subsequently provide notice to the electric utility of the customer's desire to receive standard tariff service from the electric utility under procedures approved by the commission.\n\n(8) The commission shall authorize rates that will ensure that an electric utility that offered retail open access service from 2002 through October 6, 2008 fully recovers its restructuring costs and any associated accrued regulatory assets. This includes, but is not limited to, implementation costs, stranded costs, and costs authorized under section 10d(4) as it existed before October 6, 2008, that have been authorized for recovery by the commission in orders issued before October 6, 2008. The commission shall approve surcharges that will ensure full recovery of all such costs by October 6, 2013.\n\n(9) As used in subsections (1) and (7):\n\n(a) \"Customer\" means the building or facilities served through a single existing electric billing meter and does not mean the person, corporation, partnership, association, governmental body, or other entity owning or having possession of the building or facilities.\n\n(b) \"Standard tariff service\" means, for each regulated electric utility, the retail rates, terms, and conditions of service approved by the commission for service to customers who do not elect to receive generation service from alternative electric suppliers.\n\n(10) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Affiliate\" means a person or entity that directly, or indirectly through 1 or more intermediates, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another specified entity. As used in this subdivision, \"control\" means, whether through an ownership, beneficial, contractual, or equitable interest, the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or to cause the direction of the management or policies of a person or entity or the ownership of at least 7% of an entity either directly or indirectly.\n\n(b) \"Affiliate wheeling\" means a person's use of direct access service where an electric utility delivers electricity generated at a person's industrial site to that person or that person's affiliate at a location, or general aggregated locations, within this state that was either 1 of the following:\n\n(i) For at least 90 days during the period from January 1, 1996 to October 1, 1999, supplied by self-service power, but only to the extent of the capacity reserved or load served by self-service power during the period.\n\n(ii) Capable of being supplied by a person's cogeneration capacity within this state that has had since January 1, 1996 a rated capacity of 15 megawatts or less, was placed in service before December 31, 1975, and has been in continuous service since that date. A person engaging in affiliate wheeling is not an electric supplier, an electric utility, or conducting an electric utility business when a person engages in affiliate wheeling.\n\nHistory:Add. 2000, Act 141, Imd.

As used in this subsection, \"customer\" means only the building or facilities served rather than the individual, association, partnership, corporation, governmental body, or other entity taking service.\n\n(3) With respect to any electric utility regarding delivery service to customers located outside of the municipal boundaries of the municipality that owns the utility, a governing body of a municipally owned utility may elect to operate in compliance with R 460.3411 of the Michigan Administrative Code, as in effect on June 5, 2000. However, compliance with R 460.3411(13) of the Michigan Administrative Code is not required for the municipally owned utility. Concurrent with the filing of an election under this subsection with the commission, the municipally owned utility shall serve a copy of the election on the electric utility. Beginning 30 days after service of the copy of the election, the electric utility shall, as to the electing municipally owned utility, be subject to the terms of R 460.3411 of the Michigan Administrative Code as in effect on June 5, 2000.

An electric utility may propose a long-term industrial load rate in a general rate case filing or in a stand-alone proceeding. The commission shall approve the long-term industrial load rate proposed by the electric utility if the commission finds all of the following:\n\n(a) The cost of service for the capacity needed to serve the industrial customer under the proposed long-term industrial load rate is based on 1 or more designated power supply resources.\n\n(b) The proposed long-term industrial load rate requires the industrial customer to enter into a contract for a term equal to either of the following:\n\n(i) The term of the electric utility power purchase agreement or agreements, that must not be less than 15 years, for 1 or more designated power supply resources if the resources are an electric utility power purchase agreement or agreements.\n\n(ii) The expected remaining life of 1 or more designated power supply resources if the resources are utility-owned resources.\n\n(c) The proposed long-term industrial load rate requires that the industrial customer have an annual average electric demand of at least 200 megawatts at 1 site at the time the contract for a term is entered into, have an annual load factor of at least 75% at the time the contract for a term is entered into, and must demonstrate that the industrial customer would not purchase standard tariff service from the electric utility except under the long-term industrial load rate. The industrial customer demonstrates that it would not purchase standard tariff service from the electric utility except under the long-term industrial load rate if any of the following conditions exist:\n\n(i) The customer has available self-service power in a quantity equal to the contract demand level.\n\n(ii) The customer, or an entity acting on the customer's behalf, has entered the applicable regional transmission organization's generation interconnection queue for a new generation resource that, if constructed, would qualify as self-service power in a quantity equal to the contract demand level. Entering the applicable regional transmission organization's interconnection queue means compliance with all applicable interconnection application requirements, such as payment of the application fee, disclosure of the technical requirements, payment of the definitive planning phase studying funding deposit, demonstration of site control, and payment of all other applicable per-megawatt fees or deposits, as required by the regional transmission organization.\n\n(d) The proposed long-term industrial load rate is only available to the industrial customer for service at a site where the industrial customer's annual average electric demand is at least 200 megawatts at the time the contract for a term is entered into. The contract for a term must be for a minimum of 100 megawatts of firm contracted capacity.\n\n(e) If the resource designated in a contract executed under the long-term industrial load rate is a utility-owned resource, then the proposed long-term industrial load rate is based on all of the following:\n\n(i) The electric utility's levelized cost of capacity, including fixed operation and maintenance expense, associated with the designated power supply resource at the time the customer contract is executed.\n\n(ii) The electric utility's actual variable fuel and actual variable operation and maintenance expense based on the customer's actual energy consumption and associated with the designated power supply resource.\n\n(iii) The electric utility's actual energy and capacity market purchases, if any, based on the customer's actual consumption. The amount of capacity needed to serve a qualifying long-term industrial load is based on the capacity needed by the electric utility to comply with its regional transmission organization's load-serving resource requirement based on the amount of contractual firm and interruptible capacity supplied to the industrial customer.\n\n(f) If the designated resource associated with a contract executed under the long-term industrial load rate is an electric utility power purchase agreement or agreements, then the proposed long-term industrial load rate is based on recovering all costs associated with the designated power purchase agreement or agreements.\n\n(g) The proposed long-term industrial load rate ensures that the electric utility recovers its direct costs to provide transmission and distribution service to the industrial customer based on the dedicated distribution service costs and transmission service costs incurred specifically to serve the industrial customer, as approved by the commission.\n\n(2) A long-term industrial load rate may contain other terms and conditions proposed by the electric utility.\n\n(3) The commission shall approve any contract for a term proposed by an electric utility under a long-term industrial load rate authorized under this section if there is a net benefit to the electric utility's customers resulting from the industrial customer taking service under the long-term industrial load rate compared to the industrial customer not purchasing standard tariff service from the electric utility. In determining whether a net benefit exists, the commission may consider any benefit, including, but not limited to, benefits to customers as a result of the following:\n\n(a) System peak demand reduction due to ability to curtail, engage in demand response, or participate in federal load management programs.\n\n(b) Avoidance of new production capacity costs and risks for other ratepayers.\n\n(c) Ability to reduce system costs, such as by contributing to volt-var control.\n\n(4) If the customer taking service under a long-term industrial load rate will contribute to the electric utility's fixed distribution or transmission costs that otherwise would have been recovered from the electric utility's other customers as compared to the customer not purchasing standard tariff service from the electric utility, then the commission shall determine that a net benefit exists under subsection (3).\n\n(5) An electric utility may submit a proposal for a long-term industrial load rate and a proposed contract for a term under the proposed long-term industrial load rate in the same proceeding.\n\n(6) If an electric utility proposes a long-term industrial load rate in a stand-alone proceeding, that proceeding must be conducted as a contested case under chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288, and must be supported by a complete cost of service study, rate design, and proposed tariffs reflecting the impact of the long-term industrial load rate on other customer rates. A stand-alone proceeding filed under this section must not be expanded to result in any changes to the electric utility's overall revenue requirement. The commission shall issue a final order in a stand-alone proceeding conducted under this section no later than 270 days after an electric utility files an application requesting approval of a long-term industrial load rate.\n\n(7) A contract for a term executed under a long-term industrial load rate approved under this section is considered reasonable and prudent for the contract's entire term.\n\n(8) A designated power supply resource that is an electric utility power purchase agreement or agreements may be a power purchase agreement or agreements with an affiliate of the electric utility.\n\n(9) A single customer may not aggregate load from multiple sites to meet the requirements of this section. Multiple customers may not aggregate load to meet the requirements of this section.\n\n(10) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Annual load factor\" means a load factor calculated as an average of the prior 12 monthly load factors. Each monthly load factor must be determined by dividing the customer's actual monthly kilowatt hours consumption by the product of the customer's monthly maximum on peak demand and the number of hours in the month.\n\n(b) \"Contract for a term\" means an agreement executed between an electric utility and industrial customer under a long-term industrial load rate authorized by this section.\n\n(c) \"Electric utility power purchase agreement\" means an agreement executed between an electric utility and an electric generation facility not owned by the electric utility for the purchase of energy and capacity.\n\n(d) \"Long-term industrial load rate\" means a rate approved by the commission under this section.\n\n(e) \"Self-service power\" means that term as defined in section 10a(4).\n\n(f) \"Site\" means an industrial site or contiguous industrial site or single commercial establishment.
