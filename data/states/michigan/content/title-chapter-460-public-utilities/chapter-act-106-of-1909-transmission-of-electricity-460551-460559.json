The electric utility has the right to a hearing in respect to the complaint. After investigation and hearing, the commission may by order fix the price of electricity to be charged by the electric utility within lawful limits. The electric utility shall receive notice of the price fixed by the commission and shall charge that fixed price until the commission changes the fixed price. The commission may establish by order rules and conditions of service that are just and reasonable. In determining the price, the commission shall consider and give due weight to all lawful elements necessary to determine the price to be fixed for supplying electricity, including cost, reasonable return on the fair value of all property used in the service, depreciation, obsolescence, risks of business, value of service to the consumer, the connected load, the hours of the day when used, and the quantity used each month.

A rate shall not be changed with respect to 1 or more of the cities, villages, townships, or communities so as to establish a rate difference within the territory served, unless it is shown that the continuance of the identical or substantially identical rate or rates will work substantial hardship to a city, village, township, person, firm, or corporation affected or unless otherwise provided by law.\n\n(4) The rates of an electric utility shall be just and reasonable and a consumer shall not be charged more or less than other consumers are charged for like contemporaneous service rendered under similar circumstances and conditions. An electric utility doing business within this state shall not, directly or indirectly by a special rate, rebate, draw-back, or other device, charge, demand, collect, or receive from a person, partnership, or corporation, a greater or lesser compensation for a service rendered than the electric utility charges, demands, collects, or receives from any other person, partnership, or corporation for rendering, a like contemporaneous service.\n\nA person, partnership, or corporation shall not, directly or indirectly, ask, demand, or accept a rebate, draw-back, or other device by which the person, partnership, or corporation shall obtain electric service for a rate less than that charged others in like circumstances.\n\n(5) Rate-making pursuant to this act is subject to the electric transmission line certification act.\n\n(6) The commission may promulgate rules for the conduct of its business and the proper discharge of its functions under this act, pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.201 to 24.328 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.
