If conditions make complete exposure of the facility impractical, an excavator shall consult with the facility owner or facility operator to reach agreement on how to protect the facility. For excavations in a caution zone parallel to a facility, an excavator shall use soft excavation at intervals as often as reasonably necessary to establish the precise location of the facility. An excavator may use power tools and power equipment in a caution zone only after the facilities are exposed or the precise location of the facilities is established.\n\n(6) An excavator shall provide support or bracing of facilities or excavation walls in an excavation or blasting area that are reasonably necessary for protection of the facilities.\n\n(7) An excavator shall provide notification to the notification system if facility markings are destroyed or covered by excavation or blasting activities or if a ticket expires before the commencement of excavation. If a ticket expires before the commencement of excavation, an excavator shall provide a new dig notice to the notification system, and comply with subsection (1).\n\n(8) An excavator shall provide notification to the notification system requesting additional assistance if the location of a marked facility within the approximate location cannot be determined.\n\n(9) An excavator shall provide immediate additional notice to the notification system and stop excavation in the immediate vicinity if the excavator has reason to suspect the presence of an unmarked facility due to any 1 of the following:\n\n(a) Visible evidence of a facility with no marks visible.\n\n(b) Lack of a positive response to a ticket.\n\n(c) A positive response from a facility owner or facility operator indicating the presence of a facility with no marks visible.\n\n(10) If an excavator contacts or damages a facility, the excavator shall provide immediate notice to the facility owner or facility operator.\n\n(11) If an excavator damages a facility resulting in the escape of any flammable, toxic, or corrosive gas or liquid, or endangering life, health, or property, the excavator shall call 9-1-1 and provide immediate notice to the facility owner or facility operator.

In an emergency, blasting or excavation required to address the conditions of the emergency may be performed as the emergency conditions reasonably require, subject to the provisions in this act for emergency notice and marking facilities in response to an emergency notice.\n\n(13) If the location of a proposed excavation or blasting cannot be described in a manner sufficient to enable the facility owner or facility operator to ascertain the precise tract or parcel involved, an excavator shall provide white lining in advance of submitting a ticket or additional assistance to the facility owner or facility operator on reasonable request to identify the area of the proposed excavation or blasting.\n\n(14) For purposes of this section, notice to the notification system constitutes notice to all facility owners or facility operators regarding facilities located in the area of the proposed excavation or blasting.\n\n(15) Except as otherwise provided in this act, an excavator may conduct excavation in a safe zone using power equipment without establishing the precise location of any facilities.\n\nHistory:2013, Act 174, Eff.
