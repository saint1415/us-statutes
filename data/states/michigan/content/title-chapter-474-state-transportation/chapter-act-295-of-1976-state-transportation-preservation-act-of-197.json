The property acquired by the department under this act may be conveyed or leased to an entity or combination of entities listed in this subsection with appropriate reimbursement, as determined by the department.\n\n(2) Upon acquisition of a right-of-way, the department may preserve the right-of-way for future use as a railroad line and, if preserving it for that use, shall not permit any action that would render it unsuitable for future rail use. If the department determines a right-of-way or other property acquired under this act is no longer necessary for railroad transportation purposes, the department may preserve and utilize the right-of-way for other transportation purposes or may dispose of the right-of-way or other property acquired under this act for the purposes described in section 6, or may dispose of or lease the right-of-way or other property for other purposes, as appropriate. The department shall not dispose of or lease a right-of-way without first offering to transfer the right-of-way to the department of natural resources. If the department of natural resources desires to lease or purchase the right-of-way, the department of natural resources must indicate its desire to lease or purchase the right-of-way within 60 days and accept the offered transfer within 1 year after the offer is made. If the department of natural resources does not indicate a desire to lease or purchase the right-of-way within 60 days, the department may dispose of or lease the right-of-way as otherwise provided for in this act. If the department of natural resources does not accept the offered transfer within 1 year after indicating its desire to lease or purchase the right-of-way, the department may dispose of or lease the right-of-way as otherwise provided for in this act. When appropriate, a right-of-way or other property shall be transferred or leased to a public or private entity with appropriate reimbursement, as determined by the department.\n\n(3) In preserving a right-of-way for future rail use, the department may do 1 or more of the following:\n\n(a) Develop the right-of-way for use as a commuter trail where the use is feasible and needed or lease the right-of-way to a county, city, village, or township expressing a desire to develop the right-of-way as a commuter trail. The lease shall be for an indefinite period of time and is cancelable by the department only if the right-of-way is needed for rail usage. The trails, unless leased to a county, city, village, or township, shall remain under the jurisdiction of the department.\n\n(b) Transfer, for appropriate reimbursement, the right-of-way to the department of natural resources for use as a Michigan trailway pursuant to part 721 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.72101 to 324.72116, if the deed includes restrictions on the use of the property that assure that the property remains viable for future rail usage, and includes a clause that requires the department of natural resources to transfer, for appropriate reimbursement, the right-of-way to the department, upon a determination of the director of the department that the right-of-way is needed for use as a railroad line.\n\n(c) Lease the right-of-way to the department of natural resources, or upon approval of the department of natural resources, to a county, city, village, or township for use as a recreational trail. The lease shall be for an indefinite period of time and is cancelable by the department only if the right-of-way is needed for rail usage. A recreational trail shall be reserved for non-motorized forms of recreation or snowmobiling only. Snowmobiling shall not be allowed on more than 50% of the mileage of the recreational trails established pursuant to this act.\n\n(d) In cases where a trail serves both a significant commuter and recreation function, authorize the joint development of the trail by the department and the department of natural resources, or the department and any interested county, city, village, or township. Administration of the trail shall be determined jointly by the department and the department of natural resources.\n\n(4) As a term of conveyance, the department may require restrictions on the use of the property that assure that the property remains viable for future rail use and that the rail line is made available by the purchaser for future freight or passenger rail uses and that the property will revert to the department if the purchaser fails to maintain the property so that it remains viable for future rail use.\n\nHistory:1976, Act 295, Eff.

Subject to the maximum established by this section, the legislature shall appropriate an amount not to exceed $3,000,000.00 each year to the rail infrastructure loan fund until the maximum in subsection (5) is met. Interest earned and repayments received and any penalties assessed and received for failure to repay loans on time shall be credited to the fund. The rail infrastructure loan fund is a self-sustaining revolving loan fund to finance construction and improvements that are designed for improvements to freight railroad infrastructure for the purposes of preserving, rebuilding, rehabilitating, or constructing facilities or improvements on railroad operating property or property adjacent to railroad operating property, in this state. Construction is limited to those facilities or improvements required to continue rail service on a particular line or to improve the efficiency and safety of existing rail service. If the department determines that the public interest requires, a loan may be made to eligible applicants provided by subsection (2) to acquire rail property for the purpose of preserving freight rail service or improving the efficiency of existing freight rail service. An eligible applicant described in subsection (2) may apply for a loan from the fund for the purposes described in this section or for use as nonfederal match for any federal rail infrastructure loan program.\n\n(2) The fund shall provide noninterest bearing loans for the purposes described in this section. The department shall evaluate loan applications according to the relative merit of the project in conjunction with program goals and make recommendations to the state transportation commission regarding each loan application. The state transportation commission shall approve or deny the loans and establish loan disbursement and payment schedules based on the needs of the work in progress. A loan shall fund not more than 90% of the rail portion of project costs, and the loan repayment period shall not exceed 10 years. A county, city, township, village, economic development corporation, and railroad and current or potential users of freight railroad services are eligible applicants.\n\n(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, at the end of each fiscal year, unexpended funds shall remain in the rail infrastructure loan fund and shall be available for the purposes of the program in the succeeding fiscal year. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, $5,700,000.00 in unobligated fund balance shall be deposited in the comprehensive transportation fund. Amounts in the fund may be combined by the state treasurer with other amounts in the state treasury for purposes of cash management. The earnings from the investment of the fund shall accrue to the fund. The fund shall be accounted for separately from other funds of the state. The fund may receive gifts or grants for the purposes of the fund. Any penalties assessed and received for failure to repay a loan on time and money that is received by this state as repayment for rail infrastructure loans made pursuant to this program shall remain within the rail infrastructure loan fund and shall only be used for the purposes of rail infrastructure loans as provided in this section.\n\n(4) By December 31 each year, the department shall report to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on transportation and the house and senate fiscal agencies the following information, as appropriate, regarding this section and on a separate report the rail freight fund under section 17:\n\n(a) The beginning fund balance of each fund, revenues received, expenditures and encumbrances incurred, and the ending fund balance for each fund for the preceding fiscal year.\n\n(b) The projects funded during the preceding fiscal year.\n\n(c) The status of projects funded in the preceding fiscal years including the degree to which the projects funded have achieved the objectives of this act.\n\n(d) Status of all outstanding loans.\n\n(e) Any other information considered necessary by the department.\n\n(5) The state's total contribution to the rail infrastructure loan fund shall not exceed $15,000,000.00 exclusive of interest and any penalties assessed, received, and credited to the fund.\n\nHistory:Add. 2002, Act 747, Imd.
