      "text": "(1) The fees to accompany applications under this act are as follows:\n\n(a) Private examiner's license, original, $100.00; renewal, $50.00.\n\n(b) Public examiner's license, original, $25.00; renewal, $25.00.\n\n(c) Temporary examiner's license, original and renewal:\n\n(i) Residents applying under section 9, private examiners, $100.00; public examiners, $25.00.\n\n(ii) Nonresidents, 10-day license, $100.00; annual license, original and renewal, $200.00.\n\n(d) Intern's license, original and renewal, $25.00.\n\n(e) Duplication or alteration of license, $5.00.\n\n(f) Reinstatement fee, $25.00.\n\n(g) Licensing examination fee, $50.00.\n\n(2) Beginning the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, the department shall issue an initial or renewal license not later than 90 days after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by any agency or department of the state of Michigan. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information available electronically, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.\n\n(3) If the department fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.\n\n(4) Beginning October 1, 2005, the director of the department shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with occupational issues. The director shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:\n\n(a) The number of initial and renewal applications the department received and completed within the 90-day time period described in subsection (2).\n\n(b) The number of applications denied.\n\n(c) The number of applicants not issued a license within the 90-day time period and the amount of money returned to licensees and registrants under subsection (3).\n\n(5) As used in this section, \"completed application\" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of the state of Michigan.\n\nHistory:1972, Act 295, Eff.
