If there is more than 1 person designated as owner and no beneficiary is living at the time of the death of the last surviving owner, the account shall be probated as part of the last surviving owner's estate.\n\n(4) If more than 1 person designated as beneficiary is living at the time of the death of the owner, or at the time of the death of the last surviving owner if there was more than 1 designated owner, the account shall be divided equally among the beneficiaries still living at that time.
