Because of the immediate proximity of these features, roads may possess characteristics such as the following: pavement width of 16 to 20 feet, shoulders as narrow as 2 feet with trees immediately adjacent, curves that restrict maximum legal speeds, hills, steep side slopes, and narrow rights-of-way. The improvement philosophy for these roads is to maintain the essential elements of the road and the area immediately surrounding the road that create its unique character.\n\nHistory:1993, Act 69, Imd.
