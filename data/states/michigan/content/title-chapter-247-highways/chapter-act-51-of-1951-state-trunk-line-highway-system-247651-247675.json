The system of seasonal county roads shall be selected on the basis of seasonal use of the roads and in accordance with rules promulgated by the state transportation department. A board of county road commissioners may include or exclude roads in the seasonal county road system upon adoption of a proper resolution but only after holding a public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be given to the clerk of the county and of each city, village, or township in which the roads are situated and published at least twice in a newspaper of general circulation in that county, the first notice to be not less than 30 days before the hearing and the second notice not less than 7 days before the hearing. The notice shall contain the date, time, and place of the hearing and shall describe in general terms the action proposed to be taken by the board, the roads to be affected, and the period of time that the roads shall not be open to public travel.

All of the following apply to a multiyear program required by this subsection:\n\n(a) Projects contained in the department's annual multiyear program must be consistent with the department's asset management process and asset management plan, and must be reported consistent with categories established by the transportation asset management council.\n\n(b) Projects contained in the annual multiyear program of each local road agency responsible for 100 or more certified miles of road must be consistent with the asset management process and asset management plan of that local road agency and must be reported consistent with categories established by the transportation asset management council.\n\n(c) Projects contained in the annual multiyear program of each local road agency responsible for less than 100 certified miles of road must be consistent with the asset management process of that local road agency and must be reported consistent with categories established by the transportation asset management council.\n\n(12) Beginning October 1, 2020, each local road agency described in subsection (11)(b) shall begin submitting an asset management plan to the transportation asset management council according to the 3-year schedule described in subsection (10). The asset management plan must cover a period of at least 3 years, and must be consistent with a template provided by the transportation asset management council. A local road agency that is required to submit an asset management plan under this subsection that has not submitted the asset management plan by October 1, 2024 is not in compliance with this subsection. The transportation asset management council shall notify a local road agency that is not in compliance with this subsection that the local road agency must comply with this subsection within 120 days of the notice. If a local road agency fails to comply with this subsection after 120 days of the notice required by this subsection, the transportation asset management council shall notify the department of the noncompliance and the department may withhold funds distributed to the local road agency under this act. The department shall release any funds withheld for noncompliance with this subsection to the local road agency in the following month's allocation after compliance is verified.\n\n(13) If a local road agency responsible for less than 100 certified miles of road submits an asset management plan to the transportation asset management council, the plan is considered approved on submission.\n\n(14) The transportation asset management council shall review an asset management plan submitted under subsection (12) no later than 6 months after receipt of the asset management plan. The transportation asset management council shall compare the asset management plan to the minimum requirements of this act and the template created by the transportation asset management council, and determine whether the asset management plan is in compliance with those standards. If the asset management plan does not meet those standards, the transportation asset management council shall seek concurrence from the department that the asset management plan does not meet the transportation asset management council's standards. If the department concurs, the transportation asset management council shall require the local road agency to revise its asset management plan to conform to the standards within 6 months after notifying the local road agency that the asset management plan does not meet the transportation asset management council's standards. The transportation asset management council shall provide an opportunity for a noncompliant local road agency to appear before the transportation asset management council to discuss the reasons the local road agency's plan is not in compliance and ways for the local road agency to become compliant.\n\n(15) Beginning October 1, 2025, if the transportation asset management council determines, and the department concurs, that a local road agency described in subsection (11)(b) has not demonstrated progress toward achieving the condition goals described in its asset management plan for its federal-aid eligible county primary road system or city major street system, as applicable, the transportation asset management council shall provide notice to the local road agency of the reasons that it has determined progress is not being made and recommendations on how to make progress toward the local road agency's condition goals. The local road agency shall become compliant within 6 months after receiving the notification required by this subsection. The transportation asset management council shall provide an opportunity for the noncompliant local road agency to appear before the transportation asset management council to discuss the reasons the local road agency is not compliant and ways for the local road agency to become compliant. If the local road agency is not compliant within 6 months after receiving the notification required by this subsection, the local road agency shall not shift funds distributed to it under this act from a county primary road system to a county local road system or from a city major street system to a city local street system, as applicable. On demonstration of progress toward achieving its condition goals, a local road agency may shift funds distributed to it under this act from a county primary road system to a county local road system or from a city major street system to a city local street system, as applicable. A local road agency may submit a revised asset management plan to the transportation asset management council. If a local road agency's asset management plan is determined to be out of compliance, the local road agency's asset management plan is disapproved for the purposes of sections 12 and 13.\n\n(16) The staff assigned to the transportation asset management council shall prepare an annual report regarding the results of activities conducted during the preceding year and the expenditure of funds related to the processes and activities identified by the Michigan infrastructure council. The report must also include a summary analysis of the asset management plans and annual reports received from local road agencies, a determination of how investments are achieving desired levels of service and performance goals, an identification of any additional steps that may be needed to achieve desired levels of service and performance goals, and an overview of the activities identified for the succeeding year. The transportation asset management council shall submit this report to the Michigan infrastructure council, the state transportation commission, each house of the legislature, and the transportation committees of the house and senate by May 2 of each year.\n\n(17) Funding necessary to support the activities described in this section must be provided by an annual appropriation from the Michigan transportation fund to the state transportation commission. Beginning on September 30, 2018, the annual appropriation provided for in this subsection must be allocated to the Michigan infrastructure council and must be used to support the activities described in this section.\n\n(18) The department and each local road agency shall keep accurate and uniform records on all road and bridge work performed and funds expended for the purposes of this section, according to the procedures developed by the transportation asset management council. Each local road agency and the department shall annually report to the transportation asset management council the mileage and condition of the road and bridge system under their jurisdiction and the receipts and disbursements of road and street funds in the manner prescribed by the transportation asset management council, which shall be consistent with any current accounting procedures.\n\n(19) A local road agency may seek and use federal grants or loans to achieve the goals and manage the asset inventory described in its asset management plan.\n\nHistory:Add. 1957, Act 262, Eff.

A determination that a bridge project is selected for funding in a given fiscal year is not approval to disburse the money.\n\n(13) A county road commission, city, or village may implement a bridge project if the bridge project has been selected for funding and is included in the appropriate regional bridge council's current multiyear bridge plan for the local bridge program but the regional bridge council has not allocated money to the bridge project for the fiscal year that the bridge project is on the current multiyear bridge plan. A county road commission, city, or village may borrow money to implement a project that has been selected for funding and is included in the appropriate regional bridge council's current multiyear bridge plan but has not been allocated money by the regional bridge council. Based on available local bridge money, when a bridge project that was implemented with borrowed money is allocated funding in a subsequent fiscal year, the funding must only be used to repay the amount approved by the multiyear bridge plan when the money was borrowed. To be eligible for repayment of the amount borrowed, a bridge project that has been implemented with borrowed money must be administered through the department's local bridge program.\n\nHistory:1951, Act 51, Eff.

      "text": "(1) Twenty-three to twenty-seven percent of the DOT-FHWA highway research, planning, and construction federal funds appropriated to this state from the federal government for road and bridge construction must be allocated to programs administered by local jurisdictions after deduction of the following:\n\n(a) Funds that are specifically allocated at the federal level to this state or local jurisdictions.\n\n(b) Funds allocated by the department to this state and to local jurisdictions through a competitive process.\n\n(2) Federal aid excluded from the calculation of funding allocated to programs administered by local jurisdictions in subsection (1) includes, but is not limited to, congestion mitigation and air quality funds, federal bridge funds, transportation enhancement funds, funds distributed at the discretion of the United States Secretary of Transportation, and congressionally designated funds.\n\n(3) The funds must be distributed to eligible local agencies for transportation purposes in a manner consistent with state and federal law.\n\n(4) It is the intent of the legislature that federal aid to highways allocated to local jurisdictions in subsection (1) be distributed in a manner that produces a 25% average allocation of applicable funds to programs for local jurisdictions in each fiscal year through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000. Beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, the average allocation of applicable federal aid to highway funds to programs for local jurisdictions must be the average of the amount distributed to local jurisdictions under subsection (1) and similarly calculated distributions in each succeeding fiscal year. The average allocation percentage described in this subsection must be adjusted to reflect any agreements made by the department with local jurisdictions regarding the state buyout of local federal aid.\n\n(5) Subject to subsections (6) to (15), the department shall award money from the state trunk line fund to local road agencies in exchange for federal aid obligation authority allocated to local-agency projects as provided in this section, if allowed by federal law and rules.\n\n(6) The department must make available money from the state trunk line fund in exchange for federal aid obligation authority awarded to local road agencies in the amounts described in subsection (8) unless the amount must be reduced to do either or both of the following:\n\n(a) Match all available federal aid including reapportionments, redistributions, or other awards of federal aid obligation authority.\n\n(b) Provide for debt service, the minimum state-funded program, routine maintenance of state trunk lines, administration, and all other functions of the department.\n\n(7) If the department reduces the amount of money available from the state trunk line fund under subsection (6), the department must submit a letter to the chairpersons of the senate and house of representatives transportation committees, the chairpersons of the senate and house of representatives transportation appropriations subcommittees, the senate majority leader, and the speaker of the house of representatives explaining why the department is unable to match available federal aid or perform its essential functions.\n\n(8) Except if reduced under subsection (6), the amount of money available from the state trunk line fund in exchange for federal aid obligation authority awarded to local road agencies must be not less than the following amounts:\n\n(a) In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, $25,000,000.00.\n\n(b) In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, $35,000,000.00.\n\n(c) In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, and in every subsequent fiscal year, $45,000,000.00.\n\n(9) Local road agencies may apply for state money in exchange for 100% of the federal aid obligation authority allocated by the department to a local road agency project in a metropolitan planning organization transportation improvement program or in the rural transportation improvement program, in the manner and on the schedule determined by the department. The department must publish announcements, instructions, forms, and deadlines on its website. If applications are received that request more state money than is available to be exchanged in a fiscal year, awards must be made in the order received.\n\n(10) State money must be exchanged with local road agencies for federal aid obligation authority in an amount equal to 90 cents per dollar of all federal aid obligation authority allocated in the approved transportation improvement plan to each project for which authority is exchanged.\n\n(11) The department must pay state money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority to local road agencies when sufficient federal aid obligation authority is received from the Federal Highway Administration to cover the exchanges, not including any year-end redistributions.\n\n(12) The first priority for the use of state money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority must be the local road agency project for which the federal aid obligation authority was originally proposed. If the state money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority exceeds the cost of the original project, any surplus must be applied to federal-aid-eligible projects by the local road agency or returned to the department. Completed work must be reported to the transportation asset management council investment reporting tool or any successor system.\n\n(13) State money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority must be expended not later than 3 years after the exchange. If the project for which federal aid obligation authority was exchanged cannot be completed within 3 years, the local road agency must notify the department and its metropolitan planning agency or rural task force and identify an alternate project eligible for federal aid that can be constructed within the original 3-year period, or return the money to the department.\n\n(14) In accordance with 23 USC 112, 23 CFR 635.104(b), and Federal Highway Administration Directive 5060.1, a local road agency that is awarded state money in exchange for federal aid obligation authority shall follow the policies adopted by the department that govern the number of force accounts and the total amount of money spent on force account project cost authorizations in a fiscal year. For each fiscal year in which a local road agency is awarded state money in exchange for federal aid obligation authority, the local road agency must certify to the department that the limits in this subsection are not exceeded. This subsection applies only to state money awarded in exchange for federal aid obligation authority as described in this section and not to any money garnered through any other means.\n\n(15) Contracts between local road agencies and contractors for projects funded from state money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority must contain a federal wage and benefits schedule consistent with, and incorporating the requirements of, Section IV of Form FHWA 1273, revised May 1, 2012, or any successor form, and provide that covered workers are third-party beneficiaries of these contract requirements.\n\n(16) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Federal aid obligation authority\" means federal aid obligation authority and an equal amount of contract authority.\n\n(b) \"Minimum state-funded program\" includes, but is not limited to, preservation, preventive maintenance, maintenance, operations, safety, administration, and all other essential functions not eligible for federal aid, as determined by the department.\n\nHistory:Add. 1998, Act 308, Imd.

The department shall compile and make available to the public an annual report of all warranties that were secured under this subsection and all pavement projects whose costs exceed $2,000,000.00 where a warranty was not secured as provided in subsection (14). If an appropriate certificate is filed under section 18e but only to the extent necessary, this subsection does not prohibit the use of any amount of money restricted as to use by section 9 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 and deposited in the state trunk line fund for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations pledging for the payment thereof money restricted as to use by section 9 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 and deposited in the state trunk line fund, whenever issued, as specified under subsection (1)(a). The amounts that are deducted from the state trunk line fund for the purpose of the calculation required by this subsection are as follows:\n\n(a) Amounts expended for the purposes described in subsection (1)(a) for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations issued before July 2, 1983.\n\n(b) Amounts expended to provide the state matching requirement for projects on the national highway system and for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations issued after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing money for the state matching requirements for projects on the national highway system.\n\n(c) Amounts expended for the construction of a highway, street, road, or bridge to 1 or more of the following or for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations issued after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing money for the construction of a highway, street, road, or bridge to 1 or more of the following:\n\n(i) A location for which a building permit has been obtained for the construction of a manufacturing or industrial facility.\n\n(ii) A location for which a building permit has been obtained for the renovation of, or addition to, a manufacturing or industrial facility.\n\n(d) Amounts expended for capital outlay other than for highways, roads, streets, and bridges or to pay debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations issued after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing money for capital outlay other than for highways, roads, streets, and bridges.\n\n(e) Amounts expended for the operating expenses of the department other than the units of the department performing the functions assigned on January 1, 1983 to the bureau of highways.\n\n(f) Amounts expended pursuant to contracts entered into before January 1, 1983.\n\n(g) Amounts expended for the purposes described in subsection (5).\n\n(h) Amounts appropriated for deposit in the transportation economic development fund and the rail grade crossing account pursuant to section 10(1)(a) and (h).\n\n(i) Upon the affirmative recommendation of the director of the department and the approval by resolution of the state transportation commission, those amounts expended for projects vital to the economy of this state, a region, or local area or the safety of the public. The resolution shall state the cost of the project exempted from this subsection.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the department shall expend annually at least 90% of the federal revenue distributed to the credit of the state trunk line fund in that year, except for federal revenue expended for the purposes described in subsection (2)(b), (c), (f), and (i) and for the payment of notes issued under section 18b(9) on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges.

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, beginning September 30, 2010, no more than 30% per year of the amount returned to a county for use on the county primary road system may be expended, with or without matching, on the county local road system of that county. An additional amount, not to exceed 20% per year of the amount returned to a county for use on the county primary road system, may be expended on the county local road system of that county if there is an emergency or if the county road commission determines that an additional 20% may be expended on the county local road system. The county road commission may attach any conditions to its determination if the determination is for nonemergency purposes, including, but not limited to, a requirement that the additional 20% expended on the county local road system only be used to supplement money from other sources. No more than 15% per year of the amount returned to a county for expenditure on the county local road system may be used, with or without matching, on the county primary road system of that county, and not to exceed an additional 15% per year of the amount returned to a county for expenditure on the county local road system, may, in case of an emergency or with the approval of the county road commission, be expended, with or without matching, on the county primary road system of that county.

A member of the county road commission shall not be employed individually in any other capacity for other duties with the county road commission.\n\n(14) A county road commission may enter into an agreement with a county road commission of another county, with a city or village, or with the department, to perform work on a highway, road, or street within the limits of that county or of another county.

The match may exceed 75% of the cost of construction in the case of a public emergency.\n\n(16) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, at least 90% of the state revenue returned annually to the county road commission from the Michigan transportation fund less the amounts described in subdivisions (a) to (e) must be expended annually by the county road commission for the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges, and for the payment of contractual contributions pledged for the payment of bonds or portions of bonds, debt service requirements for the payment of bonds or portions of bonds, and debt service requirements for the payment of notes and loans or portions of notes and loans issued or received after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing money for the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges. If an appropriate certificate is filed under subsection (18) but only to the extent necessary, this subsection does not prohibit the use of any amount of state revenue returned annually to the county road commissions for the payment of contractual contributions pledged for the payment of bonds, for debt service requirements for the payment of bonds, and for debt service requirements for the payment of notes or loans, whenever issued or received, as specified under subsection (8). The amounts that are deducted from the state revenue returned to a county road commission from the Michigan transportation fund, for the purpose of the calculation required by this subsection are as follows:\n\n(a) Amounts expended for the purposes described in subsection (8) for bonds, notes, loans, or other obligations issued or received before July 2, 1983.\n\n(b) Amounts expended for the administrative costs of the county road commission.\n\n(c) Amounts expended for capital outlay projects for equipment and buildings, and for the payment of contractual contributions pledged for the payment of bonds, for debt service requirements for the payment of bonds, and for debt service requirements for the payment of notes and loans issued or received after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing funds for capital outlay projects for equipment and buildings.\n\n(d) Amounts expended for projects vital to the economy of the local area or the safety of the public in the local area. Before these amounts can be deducted, the governing body over the county road commission or the county road commission, as applicable, must pass a resolution approving these projects. This resolution must state the projects that will be funded and the cost of each project. A copy of each approved resolution must be forwarded immediately to the department.\n\n(e) Amounts expended in urban areas as determined under section 12b.\n\n(17) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, except as provided in this subsection, a county road commission shall annually expend at least 90% of the federal revenue distributed to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges. A county road commission may expend in 1 year less than 90% of the federal revenue distributed to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges, if that year is part of a 3-year period in which at least 90% of the total federal revenue distributed in the 3-year period to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation purposes and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, is expended on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges. If a county road commission expends in 1 year less than 90% of the federal revenue distributed to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges and that year is not a part of a 3-year period in which at least 90% of the total federal revenue distributed in the 3-year period to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, is expended on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges, the county road commission shall expend in each year subsequent to the 3-year period 100%, or less in 1 year if sufficient for the purposes of this subsection, of the federal revenue distributed to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges until the average percentage spent on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges in the 3-year period and the subsequent years, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, is at least 90%. A year may be included in only one 3-year period for the purposes of this subsection. The requirements of this subsection are waived if compliance would cause the county road commission to be ineligible for federal revenue under federal law, but only to the extent necessary to make the county road commission eligible for that revenue under federal law. For the purpose of the calculations required by this subsection, the amount expended on urban routes by a county road commission for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system must be deducted from the total federal revenue distributed to the use of the county road commission. As used in this subsection, \"urban routes\" means those portions of 2-lane county primary roads within an urban area that have average daily traffic in excess of 15,000.\n\n(18) A county road commission shall certify to the department on or before the issuance of any bonds or notes issued after July 1, 1983, under 1943 PA 143, MCL 141.251 to 141.254, 1941 PA 205, MCL 252.51 to 252.64, or section 18c or 18d, for purposes other than the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges and purposes other than the purposes specified in subsection (16)(c) that its average annual debt service requirements for all bonds and notes or portions of bonds and notes issued after July 1, 1983, for purposes other than the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges and other than for the purposes specified in subsection (16)(c), including the bond or note to be issued does not exceed 10% of the money returned to the county road commission under this act, less the amounts specified in subsection (16)(a), (b), and (c) during the last completed fiscal year of the county road commission. If the purpose for which the bonds or notes are issued is changed after the issuance of the notes or bonds, the change must be made in a manner that maintains compliance with the certification required by this subsection, as of the date the certificate was originally issued, but the change does not invalidate or otherwise affect the bonds or notes with respect to which the certificate was issued or the obligation to pay debt service on the bonds or notes. A certification under this subsection is conclusive as to the matters stated in the certification for purposes of the validity of bonds and notes.\n\n(19) In each charter county to which funds are returned under this section, the responsibility for road improvement, preservation, and traffic operation work, and the development, construction, or repair of off-road parking facilities and construction or repair of road lighting must be coordinated by a single administrator designated by the county executive who is responsible for and represents the charter county in transactions with the department under this act.\n\n(20) Not more than 10% per year of all of the money received by and returned to a county from any source for the purposes of this section may be expended for administrative expenses. A county that expends more than 10% for administrative expenses in a year is subject to section 14(5) unless a waiver is granted by the department of treasury. As used in this subsection, \"administrative expenses\" means expenses that are not assigned including, but not limited to, specific road construction or preservation projects and are often referred to as general or supportive services. Administrative expenses do not include net equipment expense, net capital outlay, debt service principal and interest, and payments to other state or local offices that are assigned, but not limited to, specific road construction projects or preservation activities.\n\n(21) In addition to the financial compliance audits required by law, the department may conduct performance audits and make investigations of the disposition of all state money received by county road commissions, county boards of commissioners, or any other county governmental agency acting as the county road authority, for transportation purposes to determine compliance with the terms and conditions of this act. Performance audits must be conducted according to government auditing standards issued by the United States General Accounting Office. The department shall develop performance audit procedures and reporting requirements sufficient to determine whether money expended under this section was expended in compliance with this act by September 1, 2012 and shall report to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives no later than October 1, 2012 on the additional audit procedures and reporting requirements. The department shall provide notice to the county road commission, county board of commissioners, or any other county governmental agency acting as the county road authority, as applicable, of the standards to be used for audits performed under this subsection. The notice must be provided 6 months before the fiscal year in which the audit is conducted. The department shall notify the county road commission, county board of commissioners, or any other county governmental agency acting as the county road authority of any subsequent changes to the standards. County road commissions, county boards of commissioners, or any other county governmental agencies acting as county road authorities, as applicable, shall make available to the department the pertinent records for the audit. Performance audits may be performed at the discretion of the department or on receiving a request from the speaker of the house of representatives or the senate majority leader.\n\n(22) Of the amounts appropriated for a county primary or local road system under this section, where possible, a county road commission shall secure pavement warranties for full replacement or appropriate repair for contracted construction work on pavement projects whose cost exceeds $2,000,000.00 and projects for new construction or reconstruction undertaken after April 1, 2016, if allowed by the Federal Highway Administration and the department. A county road commission shall submit a proposed warranty program to the department for approval no later than April 1, 2016. If a proposed warranty program submitted under this subsection is approved by the department, the county road commission shall implement the program no later than 1 year after the approval. A county road commission shall include a list of all warranties that were secured under this subsection and indicate whether any of those warranties were redeemed with the report required under section 14(3), and shall also list all pavement projects whose cost exceeds $2,000,000.00 for which a warranty was not secured. The list must include, but is not limited to, all of the following information:\n\n(a) The type of project.\n\n(b) The cost or estimated cost of the project.\n\n(c) The expected lifespan of the project.\n\n(d) Whether or not the project met or is currently meeting its expected lifespan.\n\n(e) If the project failed to meet or is not meeting its expected lifespan, the cause of the failure and the cost to replace or repair the project.\n\n(f) The entity responsible for paying the cost of replacing or repairing the project.\n\n(23) Once the asset management plan for a county as described in section 9a has been approved, amounts distributed to a county under this section must be expended toward attainment of the condition goals in the asset management plan and as otherwise required by this act.\n\n(24) A county road commission may use a portion of the amount returned to the county under this section for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations.\n\nHistory:1951, Act 51, Eff.

      "heading": "Return of Distribution to City and Village Treasurers; Manner, Purpose, and Conditions; Audits; Pavement Warranties; Permissible City or Village Expenditures; Definitions",
      "text": "(1) The amount distributed to cities and villages must be returned to the treasurers of the cities and villages in the manner, for the purposes, and under the terms and conditions specified in this section. The amount received by a newly incorporated municipality must be in place of any other direct distribution of money from the Michigan transportation fund. The population of a newly incorporated municipality as determined under this section must be added to the total population of all incorporated cities and villages in this state in computing the amounts to be returned under this section to each municipality in the state. Major street mileage, local street mileage, and equivalent major mileage, if applicable, must be determined by the department before the next month for which distribution is made following the effective date of incorporation of a newly incorporated municipality.\n\n(2) From the amount available for distribution to cities and villages during each December, an amount equal to 0.7% of the total amount returned to all cities and villages under subsections (3) and (4) during the previous calendar year must be withheld. The amount withheld must be used to partially reimburse cities and villages located in counties that are eligible for snow removal funds under section 12a and that have costs for winter maintenance on major and local streets that are greater than the statewide average. The distributions must be made annually during February and must be calculated separately for the major and local street systems but may be paid in a combined warrant. The distribution to a city or village must be equal to 1/2 of its winter maintenance expenditures after deducting the product of its total earnings under subsections (3) and (4) multiplied by 2 times the average municipal winter maintenance factor. Winter maintenance expenditures must be determined from the street financial reports for the most current fiscal years ending before July 1. A city or village that does not submit a street financial report for the fiscal year ending before July 1 by the subsequent December 31 is ineligible for the winter maintenance payment that is to be based on that street financial report. The department shall determine the average municipal winter maintenance factor annually by dividing the total expenditures of all cities and villages on winter maintenance of streets and highways by the total amount earned by all cities and villages under subsections (3) and (4) during the 12 months. If the sum of the distributions to be made under this subsection exceeds the amount withheld, the distributions to each eligible city and village must be reduced proportionately. If the sum is less than the amount withheld, the balance must be added to the amount available for distribution under subsections (3) and (4) during the next month. The distributions are for use on the major and local street systems respectively and are subject to the same provisions as money returned under subsections (3) and (4).\n\n(3) Seventy-five percent of the remaining amount to be returned to the cities and villages, after deducting the amounts withheld under subsection (2), must be returned 60% in the same proportion that the population of each bears to the total population of all cities and villages, and 40% in the same proportion that the equivalent major mileage in each bears to the total equivalent major mileage in all cities and villages. The amount returned under this subsection must be used by each city and village for the following purposes in the following order of priority:\n\n(a) For the payment of contributions required to be made by a city or village under the provisions of contracts previously entered into under 1941 PA 205, MCL 252.51 to 252.64, that have been previously pledged for the payment of the principal and interest on bonds issued under that act; or for the payment of the principal and interest upon bonds issued by a city or village under 1952 PA 175, MCL 247.701 to 247.707.\n\n(b) Payment of obligations of the city or village on highway projects undertaken by the city or village jointly with the department.\n\n(c) For the payment of principal and interest on loans received under section 11(5), to the extent other money has not been made available for that payment.\n\n(d) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, for the preservation, construction, acquisition, and extension of the major street system as defined by this act including the acquisition of a necessary right of way for the system, work incidental to the system, and an appurtenant roadside park or motor parkway, of the city or village and for the payment of the principal and interest on that portion of the city's or village's general obligation bonds that are attributable to the construction or reconstruction of the city's or village's major street system. However, once an asset management plan described in section 9a has been approved, funds shall be used for the preservation, construction, and acquisition of the street system as provided in subsection (16) or for an emergency as described in section 11c. Not more than 5% per year of the money returned to a city or village by this subsection shall be expended for the preservation or acquisition of appurtenant roadside parks and motor parkways. Surplus money may be expended for the development, construction, or repair of off-street parking facilities, and the construction or repair of street lighting, and transfer to the local street system under subsection (6).\n\n(e) For capital outlay projects for equipment and buildings, contributions pledged for the payment of loans and for the payment of contractual debt service requirements for the payment of bonds for the purpose of providing money for capital outlay projects for equipment and buildings necessary to the development and maintenance of the road system so long as amounts allocated under this subdivision are used for transportation purposes.\n\n(4) The remaining amount to be returned to incorporated cities and villages must be expended in each city or village for the preservation, construction, acquisition, and extension of the local street system of the city or village, including the acquisition of a necessary right of way for the system, work incidental to the system, and subject to subsection (5), for the payment of the principal and interest on the portion of the city's or village's general obligation bonds that are attributable to the construction or reconstruction of the city's or village's local street system. However, once an asset management plan described in section 9a has been approved, funds shall be used for the preservation, construction, and acquisition of the street system as provided in subsection (16) or for an emergency as described in section 11c. The amount returned under this subsection must be returned to the cities and villages 60% in the same proportion that the population of each bears to the total population of all incorporated cities and villages in this state, and 40% in the same proportion that the total mileage of the local street system of each bears to the total mileage in the local street systems of all cities and villages of this state. The payment of the principal and interest on bonds issued by a city or village under 1952 PA 175, MCL 247.701 to 247.707, and after that payment, the payment of debt service on loans received under section 11(5), must have priority in the expenditure of money returned under this subsection.\n\n(5) Money distributed to each city and village for the maintenance and preservation of its local street system under this act represents the total responsibility of this state for local street system support. Money distributed from the Michigan transportation fund must not be expended for construction purposes on city and village local streets except to the extent matched from local revenues including other money returned to a city or village by this state under the state constitution of 1963 and statutes of this state, from money that can be raised by taxation in cities and villages for street purposes within the limitations of the state constitution of 1963 and statutes of this state, from special assessments, or from any other source.\n\n(6) Money returned under this section to a city or village must be expended on the major and local street systems of that city or village. However, the first priority is the major street system. Money returned for expenditure on the major street system must be expended in the priority order provided in subsection (3) except that surplus money may be transferred for preservation of the local street system. Major street money transferred for use on the local street system must not be used for construction but may be used for preservation. A city or village shall not transfer more than 50% of its annual major street funding for the local street system unless it has adopted and is following an asset management process for its major and local street systems and adopts a resolution with a copy to the department setting forth all of the following:\n\n(a) A list of the major streets in that city or village.\n\n(b) A statement that the city or village is adequately maintaining its major streets.\n\n(c) The dollar amount of the transfer.\n\n(d) The local streets to be funded with the transfer.\n\n(e) A statement that the city or village is following an asset management process for its major and local street systems.\n\n(7) A city or village that has not adopted an asset management plan shall obtain the concurrence of the department to transfer more than 50% of its major street funding to its local street system. The department may provide for pilot projects that would allow a city or village that has adopted an asset management plan under subsection (6) to combine their local and major street funds into 1 street fund and to submit a single report to the department on the expenditure of money on the local and major street systems.\n\n(8) Not more than 10% per year of all of the money returned to a city or village from any source for the purposes of this section may be expended for administrative expenses. A city or village that expends more than 10% for administrative expenses in a year is subject to section 14(5).\n\n(9) In each city and village to which money is returned under this section, the responsibility for street preservation and the development, construction, or repair of off-street parking facilities and construction or repair of street lighting shall be coordinated by a single administrator designated by the governing body who shall be responsible for and shall represent the municipality in transactions with the department under this act.\n\n(10) Cities and villages may provide for consolidated street administration. A city or a village may enter into an agreement with other cities or villages, the county road commission, or with the state transportation commission for the performance of street or highway work on a road or street within the limits of the city or village or adjacent to the city or village. The agreement may provide for any of the contracting parties to perform the work contemplated by the contracts including services and acquisition of rights of way, by purchase or condemnation in its own name. The agreement may provide for joint participation in the costs if appropriate.\n\n(11) Interest earned on money returned to a city or a village for purposes provided in this section must be credited to the appropriate street fund.\n\n(12) In addition to the financial compliance audits required by law, the department may conduct performance audits and make investigations of the disposition of all state money received by cities and villages for transportation purposes to determine compliance with the terms and conditions of this act. Performance audits must be conducted according to government auditing standards issued by the United States General Accounting Office. The department shall develop all performance audit procedures and reporting requirements sufficient to determine whether money expended under this section was expended in compliance with this act by September 1, 2012 and shall report to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives no later than October 1, 2012 on the additional audit procedures and reporting requirements. The audit procedures must include a review of the road fund balance of the city or village. The cities and villages shall report their road fund balances by fund balance component. The department shall assist cities and villages to ensure that road fund balances are consistently classified and are in compliance with the audit and reporting requirements of this section. The department shall provide notice to cities and villages of the standards to be used for audits under this subsection prior to the fiscal year in which the audit is conducted. The department shall notify cities and villages of any subsequent changes to the standards. Cities and villages shall make available to the department the pertinent records for the audit. Performance audits may be performed at the discretion of the department or on receiving a request from the speaker of the house of representatives or the senate majority leader.\n\n(13) Of the amounts appropriated for a city or village major or local street system under this section, where possible, a city or village shall secure pavement warranties for full replacement or appropriate repair for contracted construction work on pavement projects whose cost exceeds $2,000,000.00 and projects for new construction or reconstruction undertaken after April 1, 2016 if allowed by the Federal Highway Administration and the department. A city or village shall submit a proposed warranty program to the department for approval no later than February 1, 2017. If a proposed warranty program submitted under this subsection is approved by the department, the city or village shall implement the program no later than 1 year after the approval. A city or village shall include a list of all warranties that were secured under this subsection and indicate whether any of those warranties were redeemed with the report required under section 14(3), and shall also list all pavement projects whose cost exceeds $2,000,000.00 for which a warranty was not secured. The list shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following information:\n\n(a) The type of project.\n\n(b) The cost or estimated cost of the project.\n\n(c) The expected lifespan of the project.\n\n(d) Whether or not the project met or is currently meeting its expected lifespan.\n\n(e) If the project failed to meet or is not meeting its expected lifespan, the cause of the failure and the cost to replace or repair the project.\n\n(f) The entity responsible for paying the cost of replacing or repairing the project.\n\n(14) With the approval of the director of the department, a city may use up to 20% of the amount received by that city under this section for public transit purposes if more than 10,000,000 passengers used public transit within that city during the previous fiscal year.\n\n(15) A city or village may use a portion of the amount returned to the city or village under this section for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations.\n\n(16) Once the asset management plan for a city or village as described in section 9a has been approved, amounts distributed to a city or village under this section shall be expended toward attainment of the condition goals in the asset management plan and as otherwise required by this act.\n\n(17) As used in this section:\n\n(a) \"Administrative expenses\" means expenses that are not assigned under this section, including, but not limited to, specific road construction or maintenance projects, and are often referred to as general or supportive services.
