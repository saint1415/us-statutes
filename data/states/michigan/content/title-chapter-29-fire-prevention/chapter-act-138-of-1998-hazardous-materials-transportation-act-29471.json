A motor carrier that designates another participating state as its base state shall register with and obtain a permit from that state, with the appropriate fees paid for this state, prior to transporting hazardous materials in this state.\n\n(3) A motor carrier required to register in this state shall file part I of the uniform application with the department and pay an administrative fee of $50.00 and the apportioned vehicle registration fee. The amount of the registration fee shall be calculated by the formula in section 4.\n\n(4) A motor carrier required to obtain a permit in this state shall file part II of the uniform application with the department and pay a permit review fee of $500.00.\n\n(5) A motor carrier shall have and maintain financial responsibility for bodily injury, property damage, or environmental damage to third parties caused by accidental occurrences arising from hazardous materials transportation activities of the motor carrier. The motor carrier shall have and maintain fleet liability coverage for accidental occurrences in an amount not less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence for hazardous materials that are hazardous wastes and $750,000.00 per occurrence for hazardous materials that are liquid industrial by-product. However, a motor carrier with fleets including only vehicles under 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight shall have and maintain fleet liability coverage for accidental occurrences in an amount not less than $300,000.00. Proof of the required domiciled fleet liability coverage shall be provided to and maintained by the Michigan public service commission in the department of licensing and regulatory affairs, with certification of proper coverage provided to the department. Demonstration of proof of the required nondomiciled fleet liability coverage shall be provided to and maintained with the Surface Transportation Board in the United States Department of Transportation. Fleet liability coverage not included under the authority of the Michigan public service commission or the Surface Transportation Board shall be demonstrated to the department by submittal of the document entitled \"endorsement for motor carrier policies of insurance for public liability under section 29 or 30 of the motor carrier act of 1980\" (OMB no. 2126-0008, form MCS-90).\n\n(6) Upon a motor carrier's compliance with subsections (3), (4), and (5), the department shall issue a notice of registration form and a permit to the motor carrier. A notice of registration form and a permit shall include a unique number for each motor carrier assigned by the department.\n\n(7) A motor carrier shall maintain a copy of the notice of registration form and the permit in each power unit used to transport hazardous materials in all participating states. The notice of registration form and the permit are not transferable between motor carriers or owners. The original notice of registration form or permit shall be maintained at the motor carrier's principal place of business as noted on the registration form or permit, and shall be available for inspection during normal business hours.\n\n(8) Prior to entering the state, a motor carrier may obtain a temporary permit in lieu of a notice of registration form and a permit. The temporary permit expires 10 days after issuance, and the fee for a temporary permit is $100.00.\n\n(9) A motor carrier transporting liquid industrial by-product generated on or from property or equipment in which he or she owns an interest is exempt from registration and permitting as required in this act, but remains subject to all other provisions of part 121 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.12101 to 324.12118, or any other applicable act or part.\n\nHistory:1998, Act 138, Eff.

If a motor carrier operated only in this state, its percentage is 100%. If a motor carrier is not registered in the international registration plan, the motor carrier shall calculate the number of miles traveled using the method in the international registration plan. If a motor carrier operates more than 1 fleet under the international registration plan, the motor carrier may calculate each fleet's contribution to the motor carrier's total fee separately. A motor carrier who operated in another state under a reciprocal agreement with that state shall include the miles operated under the agreement as miles traveled in this state in calculating mileage under this section.\n\n(b) A motor carrier shall determine its percentage of hazardous materials transportation using either of the following:\n\n(i) For less than truckload shipments, it must divide the weight of all of the motor carrier's hazardous materials shipments transported during the previous year by the total weight of all shipments transported during the same year.\n\n(ii) For truckload shipments, it must divide the total number of hazardous materials shipments during the previous year by the total number of all shipments transported during the same year.\n\n(c) A motor carrier shall select the midpoint of the 10% range that most closely approximates the motor carrier's calculation of its hazardous materials transportation business, under either option in subdivision (b).\n\n(d) A motor carrier may use data from its most recent complete fiscal year or the most recent calendar year in calculating the percentage required under this section.\n\nHistory:1998, Act 138, Eff.
