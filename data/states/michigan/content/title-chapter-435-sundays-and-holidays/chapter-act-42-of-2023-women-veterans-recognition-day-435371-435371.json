      "text": "(1) The legislature recognizes all of the following:\n\n(a) Women have proudly served the United States in many military roles throughout its history. The roles include, but are not limited to, all of the following:\n\n(i) Soldiers, disguised as men, during the American Revolution and the American Civil War.\n\n(ii) Nurses in World War I.\n\n(iii) Combat helicopter pilots in Afghanistan.\n\n(b) Women have served as an informal part of the United States Armed Forces since its inception. Women have served as a formal part of the United States Armed Forces since the establishment of the Army Nurse Corps in 1901.\n\n(c) In 1917, the United States Navy announced that it would allow women to enlist. During World War I, approximately 12,000 women served in the United States Navy as couriers and translators, among other roles. By 1945, the end of World War II, there were approximately 280,000 women in the United States Armed Forces.\n\n(d) Women were permitted to serve as permanent members of the United States Armed Forces with the enactment of the women's armed services integration act of 1948, but the federal law restricted women to not more than 2% of the enlisted force for each branch of the United States Armed Forces. A subsequent act in 1967 lifted the restriction and allowed women to achieve higher military rank.\n\n(e) Laws passed since the 1970s have formally granted veteran status to women with World War II service; have recognized the many contributions made by women veterans; and have allowed women veterans more equal status and access to benefits, opportunities, and programs from the federal government, state governments, and veteran service organizations.\n\n(f) More than 2,000,000 women veterans live in the United States, and approximately 48,000 women veterans reside in this state.\n\n(2) In recognition of women veterans, the legislature declares that June 12 of each year shall be known as \"Women Veterans Recognition Day\".\n\nHistory:2023, Act 42, Imd.
