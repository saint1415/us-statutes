      "text": "The legislature recognizes the fundamental contribution that Willie Horton has made to the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan through his humanitarian works. Raised in a Detroit housing project, Willie fulfilled a boyhood dream by playing for his hometown team, the Detroit Tigers. Throughout his career, Willie has been involved with such organizations as the United Way, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Meals on Wheels, and the Foundation Fighting Blindness. His dedication to helping the youth of his city and beyond has been a hallmark of his playing career and in the years since he left the game. In 1967, Willie used his ambassadorship and goodwill to help crush the violence that erupted during the riots in Detroit. In 2000, the Detroit Tigers further honored this man by retiring his number and erecting a statue in his image at Comerica Park. In recognition of this great man, the legislature declares October 18 of each year to be known as \"Willie Horton Day\".\n\nHistory:2004, Act 53, Imd. Eff. Apr. 8, 2004",
