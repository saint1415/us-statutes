      "text": "(1) The legislature recognizes the great number of tragic deaths of children of all ages from all causes that occur each year. Each day in America many children and youths under age 20 commit suicide, are victims of a homicide, or die as a result of accidents. Many more children die from illness. In commemoration of this terrible toll, the legislature declares that the fourth Friday in April of each year shall be known as \"Children's Memorial Day\".\n\n(2) The legislature encourages individuals, educational institutions, and social, community, religious, labor, and business organizations to pause on children's memorial day and reflect upon the precious resource that our children constitute and the great loss we suffer when we lose our children.\n\nHistory:2003, Act 213, Imd. Eff. Nov. 26, 2003",
