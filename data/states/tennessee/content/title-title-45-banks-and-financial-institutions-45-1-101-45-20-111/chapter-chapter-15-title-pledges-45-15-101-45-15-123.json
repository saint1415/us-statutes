In determining whether this qualification has been met, and for the purpose of investigating compliance with this chapter, the commissioner may review and approve:(A)The relevant business records and the capital adequacy of the applicant;(B)The financial responsibility, financial condition, business experience, character, and general fitness of any person who is a director, officer, a shareholder who owns five percent (5%) or more of the applicant, or owns or controls the applicant; and(C)Any record on the part of the applicant, or any person referred to in subdivision (a)(2)(B), of any criminal activity, any fraud or other act of personal dishonesty, any act, omission or practice that constitutes a breach of a fiduciary duty, or any suspension, removal or administrative action by any agency or department of the United States or any state, from participation in the conduct of any business.(b)The requirements set forth in subsection (a) are continuing in nature.(c)Each application for a license shall be in writing and under oath to the commissioner, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, and shall include the following:(1)The legal name, residence and business address of the applicant, and, if the applicant is a partnership, association, or corporation, of every member, officer, managing employee and director of the applicant;(2)The location in Tennessee at which the registered officer of the applicant shall be located; and(3)Other data and information the commissioner may require with respect to the applicant, its directors, trustees, officers, members, managing employees or agents.(d)Each application for a license shall be accompanied by:(1)A nonrefundable supervision fee, as provided in §45-1-118(i). The supervision fee shall be applicable to each location;(2)A balance sheet and income statement for the immediately preceding fiscal year end, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles by a certified public accountant or public accounting firm not affiliated with the applicant. For a newly created entity, the commissioner may accept only a balance sheet prepared by a certified public accountant or public accounting firm not affiliated with the applicant, accompanied by a projected income statement demonstrating that the title pledge lender will have adequate capital after payment of start-up costs; and(3)A surety bond, issued by an insurer regulated under title 56 and not affiliated with the applicant, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) for each location. However, in no event shall the aggregate amount of the surety bond required for a single title pledge lender exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). In lieu of the surety bond, the applicant shall file an irrevocable letter of credit, in the amount of the surety bond, issued by any federally insured bank, savings bank or credit union not affiliated with the applicant. The surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be in a form satisfactory to the commissioner, and shall be payable to the commissioner for the benefit of any person who is injured pursuant to a title pledge or property pledge transaction by the fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, financial failure or violation of any provision of this chapter by a title pledge lender. In the case of a bond, the aggregate liability of the surety, in no event, shall exceed the principal sum of the surety bond. In the case of an irrevocable letter of credit, title pledge lenders shall obtain letters of credit for terms of not less than three (3) years and renew the letters of credit annually. If the title pledge lender fails to pay a person or the commissioner as required by this chapter, then a person may bring suit against the title pledge lender directly on the surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit in any court of competent jurisdiction, or the commissioner may bring suit in the chancery court of Davidson County, on behalf of those persons, either in one (1) or successive actions. The surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be maintained by the title pledge lender for not less than three (3) years, following the expiration, revocation, suspension, or surrender of the license.(e)Upon the filing of an application in a form prescribed by the commissioner, accompanied by the fee and documents required in this section, the commissioner shall investigate to ascertain whether the qualifications prescribed by this section have been satisfied. If the commissioner finds that the qualifications have been satisfied, and approves the documents, the commissioner shall issue to the applicant a license to engage in the title pledge lending business in Tennessee. A license issued pursuant to this subsection (e) shall remain in force and effect through December 31 in the year it was issued, unless earlier surrendered, suspended or revoked pursuant to this chapter.(f)If the commissioner determines that an applicant is not qualified to receive a license, the commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that the application has been denied, stating the basis for denial. If the commissioner denies an application, or if the commissioner fails to act on an application within ninety (90) days after the filing of a properly completed application, the applicant may make written demand to the commissioner for a hearing before the commissioner on the question of whether the license should be granted. Any hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5. In the hearing, the burden of proving that the applicant is entitled to a license shall be on the applicant. A decision of the commissioner following any hearing on the denial of license is subject to review under the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act.(g)The license shall be kept conspicuously posted in the place of business of the title pledge lender.(h)The license is not transferable or assignable.(i)Licenses issued pursuant to this chapter expire on December 31. A license may be renewed for the ensuing twelve-month period upon application by the license holder showing continued compliance with the requirements of this section and the payment of the nonrefundable supervision fee, as provided in §45-1-118(i). A licensee making timely and complete application for renewal of its license may continue to operate under its existing license until its application is approved or denied. The completed renewal application and the payment of the annual supervision fee must be sent to the department on or before December 31, but no earlier than November 1, of each year.(j)The commissioner may establish a biennial licensing arrangement for the filing of the application for license renewal, but in no case shall the supervision fee be payable for more than one (1) year at a time.(k)(1)A change in control of a title pledge lender shall require thirty-day prior written notice to the commissioner. In the case of a publicly traded corporation, notification shall be made in writing, within thirty (30) days of a change or acquisition of control of a title pledge lender.(2)Upon notification of a change in control, the commissioner may require information deemed necessary to determine whether an application for license is required.
