However, no licensee shall have the authority to assess a handling charge against the maker or drawer authorized by §47-29-102or the right to collect attorney's fees relating to the check. No other provisions of title 47, chapter 29, are applicable to a person licensed under this chapter. No individual who issues a personal check to a licensee under this chapter shall be convicted under §39-14-121.(j)No licensee may alter or delete the date on any check accepted by the licensee. No licensee may accept an undated check or a check dated on a date other than the date on which the licensee accepts the check.(k)No licensee shall engage in unfair or deceptive acts, practices or advertising in the conduct of the licensed business.(l)Consistent with the nature of deferred presentment transactions, no licensee shall require a customer to provide security for the transaction or require the customer to provide a guaranty from another person.(m)Each licensee must pay the full amount of any check cashed in cash or by check issued by the licensee, less only the fees permitted under this chapter. Payment by a licensee by means of a check shall not cause the licensee to be subject to chapter 7 of this title.(n)Each licensee shall display its license in a conspicuous location in its place of business and shall post a notice in a conspicuous location in its place of business containing a description of the charges imposed by the licensee.(o)No licensee or any person related to the licensee by common ownership or control may have outstanding more than two (2) checks from any one (1) customer at any one (1) time, with the aggregate face value of all outstanding checks from any one (1) customer not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500).(p)Each licensee shall inquire of any person seeking deferred presentment services regarding the person's outstanding checks from other licensees. If the customer represents in writing that the customer has no more than two (2) checks outstanding to any licensee or licensees and that the aggregate face value of all outstanding checks issued by the customer for deferred presentment does not equal or exceed five hundred dollars ($500), a licensee may accept for deferred presentment a check in an amount that, when combined with the customer's other outstanding checks held for deferred presentment, does not exceed five hundred dollars ($500), so long as the check for deferred presentment complies with subsection (o). If the customer represents in writing that the customer has three (3) or more checks outstanding to any licensee or licensees, or if the aggregate face value of all outstanding checks issued by the customer for deferred presentment equals or exceeds five hundred dollars ($500), a licensee shall not accept another check for deferred presentment from that customer until the customer represents to the licensee in writing that the customer qualifies to issue a new check for deferred presentment in accordance with the preceding sentence. Each licensee may rely on a written representation of a customer regarding the existence of any outstanding checks for deferred presentment held by any licensee other than the licensee receiving the representation.(q)A licensee shall not renew or otherwise consolidate a deferred presentment transaction with the proceeds of another deferred presentment transaction made by the same licensee. A transaction entered into in violation of this subsection (q) is void and unenforceable in law or equity.(r)A licensee shall not use any device or agreement, including agreements with affiliated licensees, with the intent to obtain greater charges than otherwise would be authorized by this chapter.(s)(1)No deferred presentment services agreement, subject to this chapter shall:(A)Provide that the law of a jurisdiction other than Tennessee applies;(B)Provide that the customer consents to the jurisdiction of another state or foreign country;(C)Fix venue; or(D)Waive any provision of this chapter.(2)Any such provision contained in any deferred presentment services agreement subject to this chapter shall be void and not enforceable as a matter of public policy.Acts 1997 , ch. 255, § 13; 1999, ch. 14, § 1; 2001, ch. 5, §1; 2011 , ch. 205, §§ 6-10.\n\nActs 1997 , ch. 255, § 13; 1999, ch. 14, § 1; 2001, ch. 5, §1; 2011 , ch. 205, §§ 6-10.",
