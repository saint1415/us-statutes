The evaluation must be done by an evaluator designated by the commissioner to serve the court. If the evaluator concludes that further evaluation and treatment are needed, only then may the court order the defendant admitted, and, if in a department facility, in the custody of the commissioner for not more than thirty (30) days for further evaluation and treatment for competence to stand trial subject to the availability of suitable accommodations.(b)At any stage of a felony criminal proceeding, including a pretrial hearing, trial, sentencing, or post-conviction proceeding, the state may move or petition the court to authorize the district attorney general to designate a qualified expert to examine the defendant if the defendant gives notice that the defendant intends to offer testimony about the defendant's mental condition, whether in support of a defense of insanity or for any other purpose. The court may authorize the district attorney general to designate a qualified expert, who is willing to be appointed, to examine the defendant, if:(1)An evaluator under subsection (a) notifies the court in a pretrial proceeding that the type or extent of assessment required exceeds the expertise or resources available to the evaluator or exceeds the scope of analysis of the defendant's competence to stand trial; or(2)In any other type of felony criminal proceeding, the court determines that examination of the defendant by a qualified expert for the state is necessary to adjudicate fairly the matter before it.(c)The amount and payment of expert fees must be determined and paid by the district attorneys general conference.(d)(1)Except as provided in subdivision (d)(2), during the post-conviction stage of a criminal proceeding, if it is believed that a defendant is incompetent to assist counsel in preparation for, or otherwise participate in, the post-conviction proceeding, then the court may, upon its own motion, order that the defendant be evaluated on either an outpatient or inpatient basis, as may be appropriate.

Prior to transporting a defendant for such evaluation and treatment in a department facility, the sheriff or other transportation agent must determine that the receiving department facility has available suitable accommodations. Any costs incurred by the administrative office of the courts must be absorbed within the current appropriation for the indigent defense fund.(2)In a post-conviction proceeding in a capital case, if there is a question on the defendant's mental condition at the time of the commission of the crime when there has been no such prior evaluation or a question as to whether the defendant is intellectually disabled, then the court may, upon its own motion or upon petition by the district attorney general or by the attorney for the defendant, and, if the matter is contested, after a hearing, order that the defendant be evaluated on an outpatient basis.
