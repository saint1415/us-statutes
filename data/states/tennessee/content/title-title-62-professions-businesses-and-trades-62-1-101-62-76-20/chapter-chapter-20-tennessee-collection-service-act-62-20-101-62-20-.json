The written agreement must also disclose that the collection service licensee may, for purposes of litigation, consolidate the assigned account, bill, note or other form of indebtedness with those of other creditors against the individual debtor or codebtors;(4)The assignment to the collection service licensee does not transfer title or any ownership interest in the underlying account, bill, note or other form of indebtedness to the collection service licensee; and(5)A collection service licensee bringing suit in its own name as an assignee may submit an affidavit of sworn account that has been executed under oath by the assigning party or by a person qualified to execute a sworn account pursuant to §24-5-107(a). The licensee shall file a copy of the sworn account with the court for service upon the debtor.(b)A collection service licensee may commence litigation for the collection of an assigned account, bill, note or other indebtedness in a court of competent jurisdiction located in any of the following counties:(1)The county in which the debtor signed the account, bill, note or other indebtedness sued upon;(2)In the case of consolidated accounts that all arose from the same county, the county in which all of the consolidated accounts, bills, notes or other indebtednesses arose; or(3)The county in which the debtor resides at the commencement of the action.(c)No collection service licensee shall commence any litigation authorized by this section, unless the collection service licensee appears by an attorney admitted to practice law in this state.(d)(1)For purposes of commencing litigation, a collection service licensee that has taken an assignment or assignments pursuant to this section may consolidate the assigned accounts, bills, notes or other indebtedness of one (1) or more creditors against one (1) individual debtor or codebtors, in one (1) case. Each assigned account, bill, note or indebtedness must be separately identified and pled in any consolidated action authorized by this section. The individual amount of each account, bill, note or other indebtedness that forms the basis for any consolidated action shall not exceed two hundred dollars ($200) each, as identified and pled by the collection service licensee, exclusive of court costs, attorney fees and interest that may have accrued before the filing of the consolidated action.
