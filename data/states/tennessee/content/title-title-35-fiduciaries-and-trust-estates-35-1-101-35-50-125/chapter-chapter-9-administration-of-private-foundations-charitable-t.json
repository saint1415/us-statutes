The attorney general and reporter shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt, either concur with the proposed reformation or state any specific objections to the proposed reformation in writing and delivered to the trustee by registered mail. If the attorney general and reporter state objections and those objections are not resolved to the attorney general's and reporter's satisfaction or the attorney general and reporter does not withdraw the objections, subdivision (b)(3) shall apply.(3)In the event that all of the living grantors, living beneficiaries, and charitable remainder beneficiaries do not consent to the reformation, any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the power to reform the governing instrument in accordance with subdivision (b)(1) upon petition by the trustee or any beneficiary. A copy of the petition shall be delivered in person or by registered mail to the attorney general and reporter.Acts 2000, ch. 600, § 1.\n\n(a)It is the purpose of this section to permit and authorize the reformation of certain inter vivos and testamentary charitable remainder trusts created prior to and after December 10, 1998, to comply with applicable federal tax regulations regarding qualifying payments to noncharitable beneficiaries.
