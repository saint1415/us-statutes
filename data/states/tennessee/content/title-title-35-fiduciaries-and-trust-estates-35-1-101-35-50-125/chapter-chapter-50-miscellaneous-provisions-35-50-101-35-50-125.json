No out-of-state or foreign corporate fiduciary shall have any more powers or privileges to conduct business or serve in a fiduciary capacity in this state than the laws of the state in which the foreign corporation is organized confer like powers upon corporations organized and doing business under the laws of this state or having their principal office in this state.(e)No lack of compliance with this section by any nonresident fiduciary acting as an attorney-in-fact under the power of attorney otherwise executed in accordance with the laws of this state shall be construed to affect the title to any real estate constituting the subject matter of the power of attorney.Amended by 2016 Tenn.
