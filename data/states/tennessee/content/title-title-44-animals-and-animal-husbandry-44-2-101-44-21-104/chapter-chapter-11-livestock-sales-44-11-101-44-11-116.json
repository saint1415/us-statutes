The representative may inspect all livestock that is offered for sale and may prohibit the movement of any animals that in the representative's opinion are diseased or that are likely to be carriers of disease, until final inspection is made by a qualified, accredited veterinarian, as to their condition. If, upon examination, an infectious, contagious or communicable disease or infestation is found, such animals may be sold only for immediate slaughter to a recognized slaughterer where veterinary inspection is maintained; or, the owner may, upon submission of an affidavit of ownership for at least sixty (60) days prior to sale date, return them to the original premises, where a strict quarantine must be maintained. The representative shall also issue or cause to be issued all necessary quarantines for such animals as are sold for immediate slaughter or are returned to the original premises. A copy of the quarantine shall be sent to the state veterinarian immediately following issuance, and instructions given the owner that the truck moving the quarantined animals to slaughter or returning them to the original premises must be cleaned and disinfected before being used again to transport livestock. The representative shall supervise the cleaning and disinfecting of the yards and pens at such time as may be necessary, using only those disinfectants approved by the animal disease eradication branch of the agricultural research service of the United States department of agriculture.\n\nActs 1957, ch. 208, § 9; T.C.A., §44-2307; Acts 2010 , ch. 717, § 13.",
