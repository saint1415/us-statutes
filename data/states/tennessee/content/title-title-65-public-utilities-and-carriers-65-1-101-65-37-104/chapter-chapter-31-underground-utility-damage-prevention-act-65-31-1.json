The operator shall not charge the person giving notice to the one-call service, the excavator, or property owner for the marking of its facilities. However, an operator may recover the costs of the marking of its facilities from customers in an appropriate ratemaking procedure. The operator shall not be required to indicate the depth of any such utility, but only the approximate ground location under which the utility is located. Such staking or other marking shall utilize the following color code:(i)SAFETY RED shall be used to mark electric power distribution and transmission facilities;(ii)HIGH VISIBILITY SAFETY YELLOW shall be used to mark gas and oil distribution and transmission facilities;(iii)SAFETY ALERT ORANGE shall be used to mark telephone, telegraph, cable television, video, and other telecommunications facilities;(iv)SAFETY PRECAUTION BLUE shall be used to mark water systems facilities;(v)SAFETY GREEN shall be used to mark sewer systems facilities; and(vi)SAFETY PURPLE shall be used to mark reclaimed water.(B)In the event more than one (1) operator uses the same color code under subdivision (a)(1)(A), each operator using the same color shall include a distinctive marking, such as the initials of the operator's name or other marking, that appropriately identifies each operator and sufficiently distinguishes each operator's marking from any other operator authorized to use the same color under subdivision (a)(1)(A).(2)Notwithstanding subdivision (a)(1), the underground utility damage enforcement board may establish, by rule, best practices for uniform color code and marking consistent with this part. The rules may include stakes, flags, non-permanent paint, or other low impact marking practices.
