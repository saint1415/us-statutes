      "text": "(a)This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the \"Rural Electric and Community Services Cooperative Act.\"(b)(1)The general assembly finds that rural electric cooperatives, since their inception fifty (50) years ago, have proved to be ideal business organizations in providing adequate and reliable electric services at reasonable rates throughout the rural communities of Tennessee. There are growing needs and demands for other comparable utility services in Tennessee's rural communities, including the need for television reception and programming services which are already available, for the most part, in the state's urban areas. As proved to be the case in providing electric service in rural communities, it is vital that the area coverage principle be applied in providing other utility services in the more sparsely settled areas of the state. It is, therefore, in the public's best interest that rural electric cooperatives be empowered to provide such services and that new cooperatives may be organized for such purposes.(2)The general assembly finds that unfair and unwelcomed efforts may be made in Tennessee, as they recently have in other states, whereby absentee-owned profit power companies will attempt the acquisition of properties and the take-over of the businesses of rural electric cooperatives, and thereby disrupt Tennessee's long-standing and successful policy of providing rural electric services through nonprofit, cooperative organizations. It is, therefore, in the public's best interest that laws affecting such efforts will provide fair and equitable due process procedures and standards so as to ensure that such acquisitions will not be accomplished if inimical to the best interests of the rural citizens who will be affected.(3)The general assembly further finds that Tennessee statutes currently governing electric cooperatives have not been comprehensively revised since their initial enactment. It is, therefore, in the public interest that cooperative business organizations, their respective members and the rural communities of the state would be better served by updating such statutes to make them more compatible with changed conditions and to appropriately reconcile such statutes with the new Tennessee Nonprofit Corporation Act, compiled in title 48, chapters 51-68.Acts 1988, ch. 689, §§ 1, 2; T.C.A. §65-25-201.\n\n(a)This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the \"Rural Electric and Community Services Cooperative Act.\"(b)(1)The general assembly finds that rural electric cooperatives, since their inception fifty (50) years ago, have proved to be ideal business organizations in providing adequate and reliable electric services at reasonable rates throughout the rural communities of Tennessee.

In such case, the proposal and plan therefor shall be first approved by the cooperative's board and recommended and submitted by the board to the members for their consideration and action at a special member meeting called by the board for that purpose or at the next annual member meeting, the notice of which shall contain or be accompanied by a copy of such proposal and plan; and such a sale or lease-sale shall be approved and authorized if it receives the affirmative votes of a majority of the members of the cooperative; provided, that a proposal and plan for such a sale or lease-sale need not be first approved and recommended by the board if so recommended by three hundred (300) or more members and noticed to all of the members, all as provided for in subdivision (a)(2)(D), in which event the provisions of subdivision (a)(3) shall also be applicable.(c)A proposal for the sale or lease-sale by a cooperative having the primary purpose and one (1) or more secondary purposes of all or a substantial portion of its assets and properties devoted to and used or useful in the pursuance of one (1) or more such secondary purposes may be approved, authorized and consummated by action of its board only, unless the bylaws require the approval by the members. If the cooperative has secondary purposes only, such proposal shall be first approved by the cooperative's board and recommended and submitted to the members for their consideration and action at a special member meeting called for that purpose or at the next annual member meeting, the notice of which shall contain or be accompanied by a copy of the proposal.

In the event that a cooperative acquires, merges with, or consolidates with another entity that provides any one (1) of the services authorized by this subdivision (a)(2) in a geographic location concurrent with or adjacent to the electric service area of the cooperative, then, subsequent to such transaction, nothing in this section prohibits the electric cooperative from providing the services authorized by this subdivision (a)(2) in the geographic service territory in which the acquired or merged entity was authorized to provide such services prior to the merger, acquisition, or consolidation.(3)A cooperative that elects to provide services authorized by subdivision (a)(2) shall provide other providers of such services non-discriminatory access to locate their equipment for the provision of such services on infrastructure or poles owned or controlled by the cooperative, subject to the terms of any pole attachment agreements between the cooperative and the other provider, the American National Standard Electric Safety Code described in §68-101-104, and the structural integrity of the infrastructure or pole.(b)(1)A cooperative providing any of the services authorized by subsection (a) shall not provide subsidies for such services and shall administer, operate, and maintain the electric system separately in all respects, including establishing and maintaining a separate fund for the revenues from electric operations, and shall not directly or indirectly mingle electric system funds or accounts, or otherwise consolidate or combine the financing of the electric system, with those of any other of its operations.(2)A cooperative providing any of the services authorized by subdivision (a)(2) shall administer and operate such services as a separate subsidiary.(3)Notwithstanding the limitations set out in this subsection (b), a cooperative providing the services authorized by subsection (a) is authorized to:(A)Dedicate a reasonable portion of the electric plant to the provision of such services, the costs of which shall be allocated to such services in the separate accounting required under this subsection (b); and(B)Lend funds, at a rate of interest not less than the highest rate then earned by the cooperative on invested electric plant funds, to acquire, construct, and provide working capital for the system, plant, and equipment necessary to provide any of the services authorized under subsection (a); provided, that such interest costs shall be allocated to the cost of such services in the separate accounting required under this subsection (b).(c)(1)To the extent that it provides any of the services authorized by subsection (a), a cooperative has all the powers, obligations and authority granted entities providing telecommunications services under applicable laws of the United States or this state. To the extent that such authority and powers do not conflict with title 65, chapter 4 or 5, and any rules, regulations, or orders issued thereunder, a cooperative providing any of the services authorized by subsection (a) has all the authority and powers with respect to such services as are enumerated in this chapter.(2)Notwithstanding the authorization granted in subsection (a), a cooperative shall not provide any of the services authorized by subsection (a) unrelated to its electric services within the service area of an entity in existence and operating as a telephone cooperative on April 24, 2017, with fewer than one hundred thousand (100,000) total lines organized and operating under chapter 29 of this title, and therefore shall adhere to those regulations of the 1995 Tennessee Telecommunications Act and rules of the Tennessee public utility commission, which are applicable to the telephone cooperatives, and specifically §§65-4-101and65-29-130.(d)For regulatory purposes, a cooperative shall allocate to the costs of providing any of the services authorized by subsection (a):(1)An amount for attachments to poles owned by the cooperative equal to the highest rate charged by the cooperative to any other person or entity for comparable pole attachments; and(2)Any applicable rights-of-way fees, rentals, charges, or payments required by state or local law of a non-governmental corporation that provides the identical services.(e)(1)Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow a cooperative to provide any service for which a license, certification, or registration is required under title 62, chapter 32, part 3.(2)Nothing in this chapter shall allow a cooperative to provide any service for which a license, certification, or registration is required under title 62, chapter 32, part 3, or to provide pager service.(f)This chapter supersedes any conflicting law.(g)It is unlawful for a cooperative to use unfair or anticompetitive practices prohibited by applicable state or federal law. Such practices shall include, but are not limited to, predatory pricing, collusion, and tying.(h)Any person who has been damaged as a result of a violation of this section may bring a civil action in chancery court for injunctive or declaratory relief against the violation.Amended by 2019 Tenn.
