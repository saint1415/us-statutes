      "text": "(a)Public charter school authorizers have the authority to approve applications to establish public charter schools and to make decisions regarding the renewal and revocation of a charter agreement.(b)(1)This section only applies to applications for the creation of new public charter schools that are submitted to a local board of education.(2)The local board of education shall rule by resolution, at a regular or specially called meeting, to approve or deny a public charter school application no later than ninety (90) days after the local board of education's receipt of the completed application. If the local board of education fails to approve or deny a public charter school application within the ninety-day time period prescribed in this subdivision (b)(2), then the public charter school application shall be deemed approved.(3)The grounds upon which the local board of education based a decision to deny a public charter school application must be stated in writing and must specify objective reasons for the denial. Upon receipt of the grounds for denial, the sponsor has thirty (30) days from receipt to submit an amended application to correct the deficiencies. The local board of education has sixty (60) days from receipt of an amended application to deny or to approve the amended application. If the local board of education fails to approve or deny the amended application within sixty (60) days, then the amended application shall be deemed approved.(4)(A)Until 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2020:(i)A denial by the local board of education of an application to establish a public charter school may be appealed by the sponsor to the state board of education no later than ten (10) days after the date of the final decision to deny. The appeal and review process must be conducted in accordance with this subdivision (b)(4);(ii)No later than sixty (60) days after the state board of education receives a notice of appeal, or after the state board of education makes a motion to review and provides reasonable public notice, the state board of education, at a public hearing attended by the local board of education or the local board of education's designated representative and held in the LEA in which the proposed public charter school submitted the public charter school application, shall conduct a de novo on the record review of the proposed public charter school's application and make its findings;(iii)The state board of education or the state board of education's executive director, acting for the state board of education, may allow a sponsor to make corrections to the sponsor's application on appeal, except for the elements of the application required under §49-13-107(b)(1), (2), (4), (6), (9), (12), (13), (18), and (20);(iv)If the application is for a public charter school in an LEA that does not contain a priority school on the current or last preceding priority school list, and if the state board of education finds that the local board of education's decision was contrary to the best interests of the students, LEA, or community, then the state board of education shall remand the decision to the local board of education with written instructions for approval of the public charter school application. The grounds upon which the state board of education based its decision to remand the application must be stated in writing and must specify objective reasons for the state board of education's decision. The state board of education's decision is final and is not subject to appeal. The local board of education shall be the authorizer; and(v)If the application is for a public charter school in an LEA that contains at least one (1) priority school on the current or last preceding priority school list, and if the state board of education finds that the local board of education's decision was contrary to the best interests of the students, LEA, or community, then the state board of education may approve the application for the public charter school. The state board of education's decision is final and is not subject to appeal. The state board shall be the authorizer.(B)This subdivision (b)(4) is repealed at 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2020.(5)Beginning immediately upon the repeal of subdivision (b)(4):(A)A sponsor may appeal a local board of education's decision to deny a public charter school application to the commission no later than ten (10) days after the date of the local board of education's decision. The appeal and review process must be conducted in accordance with this subdivision (b)(5);(B)After receiving a notice of appeal, the commission or the commission's designee shall:(i)Hold an open meeting in the LEA in which the proposed public charter school submitted the public charter school application. The meeting must be open to representatives from the local board of education and the sponsor. Notice of the meeting must be provided to the local board of education, the sponsor, and the general public. At least one (1) week before the meeting, notice of the meeting must be:(a)Published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the LEA is located; and(b)Posted on the commission's website; and(ii)Conduct a de novo on the record review of the proposed public charter school's application;(C)The commission shall either approve or deny a public charter school application no later than seventy-five (75) days from the commission's receipt of the notice of appeal;(D)The commission shall review applications on appeal in accordance with the state board of education's quality public charter school authorizing standards. Except as provided in subsection (c), if the commission finds that the application meets or exceeds the metrics outlined in the department of education's application-scoring rubric and that approval of the application is in the best interests of the students, LEA, or community, then the commission may approve the public charter school's application. The commission's decision is final and is not subject to appeal. If the commission approves an application, then the commission is the authorizer and the LEA for that public charter school. The commission may require a charter school authorized by the commission under this section to delay opening for up to one (1) school year through the charter agreement;(E)Notwithstanding subdivision (b)(5)(D), a public charter school authorized by the commission, and the local board of education of the LEA in which the public charter school is located, may, within thirty (30) calendar days of the public charter school's authorization, mutually agree in writing that the local board of education will be the authorizer and the LEA for the public charter school, and the local board of education shall assume the rights and responsibilities of the charter agreement. The charter agreement must be filed with the commission in a manner prescribed by the commission. This subdivision (b)(5)(E) also applies to a public charter school that has had its charter agreement renewed on appeal by the commission; and(F)(i)For accountability purposes under §49-1-602, the performance of a public charter school authorized by the commission is not attributable to the LEA in which the public charter school is geographically located; and(ii)Notwithstanding subdivision (b)(5)(F)(i), if a public charter school authorized by the commission, and the LEA in which the public charter school is geographically located, mutually agree that the local board of education will be the authorizer and the LEA for the public charter school pursuant to subdivision (b)(5)(E), then for accountability purposes under §49-1-602, the public charter school's performance shall be attributable to the LEA.(c)The local board of education may consider whether the establishment of the proposed public charter school will have a substantial negative fiscal impact on the LEA such that authorization of the public charter school would be contrary to the best interest of the students, LEA, or community. If a local board of education's decision to deny a public charter school application is based on substantial negative fiscal impact, then the commission shall consider the fiscal impact of the public charter school on the LEA before approving a public charter school on appeal. The commission may request additional information from the public charter school sponsor and the LEA regarding such consideration. The commission shall not approve for operation any public charter school that the commission determines will have a substantial negative fiscal impact on an LEA, such that authorization of the public charter school would be contrary to the best interests of the students, LEA, or community.(d)(1)An authorizer may deny a public charter school application if the proposed public charter school plans to staff positions for teachers, administrators, ancillary support personnel, or other employees by utilizing, or otherwise relying on, nonimmigrant foreign worker H1B or J1 visa programs in excess of three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the total number of positions at any single public charter school location for any school year.(2)Notwithstanding subdivision (d)(1), an authorizer shall not deny a public charter school application solely because the proposed public charter school plans to exceed the limitation in subdivision (d)(1) by employing foreign language instructors who, prior to employment, meet and, during the period for which the instructors' H1B or J1 visas have been granted, will meet all Tennessee educator licensure requirements. If an authorizer denies a public charter school application under this subsection (d), then the sponsor may appeal the authorizer's decision to deny the application as provided in subsection (b).(e)An authorizer shall not base the authorizer's approval of a public charter school application on conditions or contingencies.(f)The state board of education shall adopt quality public charter school authorizing standards based on national best practices. Authorizers shall adopt the authorizing standards approved by the state board of education.(g)No later than ten (10) days after the approval or denial of a public charter school application, the authorizer shall report to the department of education whether the authorizer approved or denied the application. The authorizer shall provide the department with a copy of the authorizer's resolution that provides the authorizer's decision and the reasons for the authorizer's decision.Amended by 2022 Tenn.

The revocation takes effect immediately following the close of the school year in which the public charter school is identified as a priority school.(2)If the authorizer does not revoke a public charter school agreement after a public charter school is identified as a priority school, then the public charter school must develop and implement a comprehensive support and improvement plan pursuant to §49-1-602(b)(6).(3)An authorizer, excluding the achievement school district and the authorizer of an opportunity public charter school, shall revoke a public charter school agreement if the public charter school receives identification as a priority school for two (2) consecutive cycles. The revocation takes effect immediately following the close of the school year in which the public charter school is identified as a priority school for the second consecutive cycle. The priority school lists issued in 2022 and 2023 shall not be considered a priority school cycle for purposes of this subdivision (a)(3) and shall not subject a public charter school to automatic revocation of its charter agreement.(4)The revocation of a public charter school agreement under subdivisions (a)(1) or (a)(3) is final and is not subject to appeal. A public charter school that is scheduled to close under this subsection (a) is entitled to a review by the department of education to verify the accuracy of the data used to identify the public charter school as a priority school.(5)This subsection (a) does not prohibit an authorizer from revoking a charter agreement of a public charter school that fails to meet the minimum performance requirements set forth in the charter agreement.(b)A public charter school agreement may be revoked by the authorizer if the authorizer determines that the school:(1)Committed a material violation of the conditions, standards, or procedures set forth in the charter agreement;(2)Failed to meet or make sufficient progress toward the performance expectations set forth in the charter agreement; or(3)Failed to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management.(c)(1)Each authorizer shall, by August 1, 2023, adopt a progressive intervention policy that outlines the process for charter school intervention if the authorizer determines that a public charter school meets the criteria for revocation under subsection (b), or if the authorizer determines that a public charter school is not complying with this chapter or with the charter agreement.(2)If an authorizer determines that a public charter school meets the criteria for revocation under subsection (b), or that a public charter school is not complying with this chapter or with the charter agreement, then the authorizer shall promptly notify the public charter school and provide the public charter school the opportunity to remedy the issue within the timeframe established by the authorizer according to the authorizer's progressive intervention policy.(3)If the public charter school fails to remedy the issue within the timeframe established by the authorizer according to the authorizer's progressive intervention policy, then the authorizer may issue corrective actions short of revocation; provided, that a corrective action shall not include a financial sanction. Corrective actions short of revocation that may be issued by the authorizer must be outlined in the authorizer's progressive intervention policy.(4)If the corrective actions fail to remedy the issue, then the authorizer may seek revocation of the charter agreement pursuant to this section.(5)Each progressive intervention policy must align with the state board of education's quality public charter school authorizing standards adopted pursuant to §49-13-108(f), and must be reviewed by the state board of education as part of the authorizer quality evaluation required under §49-13-145.(d)A charter agreement may be revoked at any time by the authorizer in an emergency situation without the authorizer first having to implement the progressive intervention policy. An emergency situation includes, but is not limited to, instances of fraud; misappropriation of funds; flagrant violation of health and safety laws, rules, and regulations; flagrant disregard of the charter agreement; or similar misconduct.(e)Thirty (30) days prior to a decision by an authorizer to revoke a charter agreement, the authorizer shall notify the public charter school in writing of the possibility of revocation and the reasons for the possible revocation.(f)If the authorizer revokes a charter agreement, then the authorizer shall clearly state in writing the reasons for the revocation.(g)No later than ten (10) days after an authorizer adopts a resolution to revoke a charter agreement, the authorizer shall report the authorizer's decision to the department of education and shall provide a copy of the resolution that sets forth the authorizer's decision and the reasons for the decision.(h)(1)A decision to revoke a charter agreement may be appealed to the commission no later than ten (10) days after the date of the decision, except for revocations based on the violations specified in subsection (a). No later than sixty (60) days after the commission receives a notice of appeal and after the commission provides reasonable public notice, the commission shall hold an open meeting in the LEA in which the public charter school has been operating to conduct a de novo on the record review of the local board of education's decision. In order to overturn a local board of education's decision to revoke a charter agreement, the commission must find that the decision was contrary to this section. If the commission overturns the local board of education's decision to revoke a charter agreement, then the commission shall remand the decision to the local board of education and the local board of education shall remain the authorizer.

The department shall make an LEA's list available to a public charter school operating in the LEA or to a sponsor seeking to establish a public charter school in the LEA.(3)A public charter school may petition the comptroller of the treasury for an audit of the list of all underutilized property or vacant property submitted by the LEA in which the public charter school is, or will be, geographically located. The comptroller of the treasury is authorized to promulgate rules, in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, for the administration of this subdivision (c)(3).(4)(A)A public charter school operating within the geographic boundaries of an LEA, excluding public charter schools in the achievement school district, has a right of first refusal to:(i)Purchase vacant property listed by the LEA under this section at or below fair market value for educational purposes; or(ii)Lease underutilized property or vacant property listed by the LEA under this section at or below fair market value for educational purposes. A lease agreement executed between a public charter school and an LEA must not reflect any outstanding bonded debt on the underutilized property or vacant property, except as agreed upon to reflect any necessary costs associated with the occupation or remodeling of the facility.(B)For purposes of this subsection (c), \"fair market value for educational purposes\" is determined by taking the average of two (2) separate appraisals conducted by two (2) independent, qualified appraisers, one (1) selected by the LEA and one (1) selected by the public charter school.(5)(A)Upon the execution of a lease agreement pursuant to this section, a public charter school has unrestricted use of the property. The public charter school shall provide for routine maintenance and repair so that the leased property is maintained in as good of order as when the lease was executed. The public charter school is responsible for paying all utilities used by the public charter school at the leased property. Extensive repairs to buildings or facilities considered capital expenses are the responsibility of the LEA funding body and not the public charter school. If the public charter school makes extensive repairs to buildings or facilities considered capital expenses, then the capital expenses must be credited against the cost of the lease. Any fixtures, improvements, or tangible assets added to leased property by the public charter school pursuant to this section must remain at the leased property upon the public charter school's return of the leased property to the LEA.(B)If the LEA decides to sell the school building that the public charter school is leasing, then the public charter school must be provided the right of first refusal to purchase the school building at or below fair market value for educational purposes, less the value of all rental payments made to the LEA during the term of the lease.(C)If, during the term of the lease, the charter school closes or ceases using the building, then the building must be placed on the LEA's vacant or underutilized property list pursuant to this subsection (c).(6)If, after the purchase of vacant or underutilized property from an LEA pursuant to this subsection (c), the public charter school closes or ceases using the property, then the LEA has the right of first refusal to purchase the property from the public charter school at or below fair market value for educational purposes. This subdivision (c)(6) does not require a public charter school to sell property owned by the public charter school or charter management organization.(d)The state board of education is authorized to promulgate rules, in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, for the administration of this section.(e)Nothing in this section is intended to frustrate an LEA's ability to plan for the use of underutilized or vacant properties owned or operated by the LEA. In any LEA in which one (1) or more charter schools operates, the LEA shall submit each year its plans for the use of underutilized or vacant properties owned or operated by the LEA in its annual report to the department of education and the comptroller of the treasury.(f)At least sixty (60) days prior to the opening of the public charter school, the charter sponsor shall submit the physical address of the public charter school to the authorizer and the department of education.
