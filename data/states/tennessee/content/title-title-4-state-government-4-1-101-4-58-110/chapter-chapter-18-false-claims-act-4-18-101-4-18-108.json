When it conducts the action, the attorney general and reporter's office or the office of the prosecuting authority of the political subdivision shall receive a fixed thirty-three percent (33%) of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, which shall be used to support its ongoing investigation and prosecution of false claims made against the state or political subdivision. When both the attorney general and reporter and a prosecuting authority are involved in a qui tam action pursuant to subdivision (c)(6)(C), the court at its discretion may award the prosecuting authority a portion of the attorney general and reporter's fixed thirty-three percent (33%) of the recovery, taking into account the prosecuting authority's contribution to investigating and conducting the action.(3)If the state or political subdivision does not proceed with an action under subsection (c), the qui tam plaintiff shall, subject to subdivisions (g)(4) and (5), receive an amount that the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages on behalf of the government. The amount shall be not less than thirty-five percent (35%) and not more than fifty percent (50%) of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of these proceeds.(4)If the action is one provided for under subdivision (d)(4), the present or former employee of the state or political subdivision is not entitled to any minimum guaranteed recovery from the proceeds. The court, however, may award the qui tam plaintiff those sums from the proceeds as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the proceeds if the state or political subdivision goes forth with the action or fifty percent (50%) if the state or political subdivision declines to go forth, taking into account the significance of the information, the role of the qui tam plaintiff in advancing the case to litigation, and the scope of, and response to, the employee's attempts to report and gain recovery of the falsely claimed funds through official channels.(5)If the action is one that the court finds to be based primarily on information from a present or former employee who actively participated in the fraudulent activity, the employee is not entitled to any minimum guaranteed recovery from the proceeds.

The court, however, may award the qui tam plaintiff those sums from the proceeds as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the proceeds if the state or political subdivision goes forth with the action or fifty percent (50%) if the state or political subdivision declines to go forth, taking into account the significance of the information, the role of the qui tam plaintiff in advancing the case to litigation, and the scope of, and response to, the employee's attempts to report and gain recovery of the falsely claimed funds through official channels.(5)If the action is one that the court finds to be based primarily on information from a present or former employee who actively participated in the fraudulent activity, the employee is not entitled to any minimum guaranteed recovery from the proceeds. The court, however, may award the qui tam plaintiff any sums from the proceeds it considers appropriate, but in no case more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the proceeds if the state or political subdivision goes forth with the action or fifty percent (50%) if the state or political subdivision declines to go forth, taking into account the significance of the information, the role of the qui tam plaintiff in advancing the case to litigation, the scope of the present or past employee's involvement in the fraudulent activity, the employee's attempts to avoid or resist the activity, and all other circumstances surrounding the activity.(6)The portion of the recovery not distributed pursuant to subdivisions (g)(1)-(5), inclusive, shall revert to the state if the underlying false claims involved state funds exclusively and to the political subdivision if the underlying false claims involved political subdivision funds exclusively. If the violation involved both state and political subdivision funds, the court shall make an apportionment between the state and political subdivision based on their relative share of the funds falsely claimed.(7)For purposes of this section, \"proceeds\" include civil penalties as well as double or treble damages as provided in §4-18-103.(8)If the state, political subdivision, or the qui tam plaintiff prevails in or settles any action under subsection (c), the qui tam plaintiff shall receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable costs and attorney's fees. All expenses, costs, and fees shall be awarded against the defendant and under no circumstances shall they be the responsibility of the state or political subdivision.(9)If the state, a political subdivision, or the qui tam plaintiff proceeds with the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorney's fees and expenses against the party that proceeded with the action if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought solely for purposes of harassment.(h)(1)The court may stay an act of discovery of the person initiating the action for a period of not more than sixty (60) days if the attorney general and reporter or local prosecuting authority shows that the act of discovery would interfere with an investigation or a prosecution of criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, regardless of whether the attorney general and reporter or local prosecuting authority proceeds with the action. This showing shall be conducted in camera.(2)The court may extend the sixty-day period upon a further showing in camera that the attorney general and reporter or local prosecuting authority has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.(i)Upon a showing by the attorney general and reporter or local prosecuting authority that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the attorney general and reporter's or local prosecuting authority's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, including the following:(1)Limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;(2)Limiting the length of the testimony of the witnesses;(3)Limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or(4)Otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.(j)There is hereby created in the state treasury a fund to be known as the \"False Claims Act Fund.\" Proceeds from the action or settlement of the claim by the attorney general and reporter pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited into this fund. Moneys in this fund, upon appropriation by the general assembly, shall be used by the attorney general and reporter to support the ongoing investigation and prosecution of false claims in furtherance of this chapter. Amounts in the fund at the end of any fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund, but shall remain available for the purposes set forth in this chapter.Acts 2001, ch. 367, § 4; 2004, ch. 763, § 1.\n\nActs 2001, ch. 367, § 4; 2004, ch. 763, § 1.",
