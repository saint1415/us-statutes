Carmack,\" which rock stands one (1) mile and twenty-eight (28) poles from the south bank of the Tennessee River, due south from near the center of the old Indian town of Nick-a-Jack, and near the top of the Nick-a-Jack Mountain at the supposed corner of the states of Georgia and Alabama; thence running due east, leaving old D. Ross two (2) miles and eighteen (18) yards in this state, and leaving the house of John Ross about two hundred (200) yards in the state of Georgia, and the house of David McNair one (1) mile and one-fourth (1/4) of a mile in this state, with blazed and mile-marked trees, lessening the variation of the compass by degrees, closing it at the termination of the line on the top of the Unicoi Mountain at five and one-half degrees (51/2°).\n\nCode 1858, § 67; Shan., § 78; Code 1932, § 89; T.C.A.
