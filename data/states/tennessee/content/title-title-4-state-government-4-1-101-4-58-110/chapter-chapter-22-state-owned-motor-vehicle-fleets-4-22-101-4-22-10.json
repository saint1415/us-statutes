All entities shall initiate plan implementation by January 1, 2014.(b)Reductions may be met by displacing the use of petroleum or oils through the use of biodiesel, ethanol, synthetic oils or lubricants, or other alternative fuels; the use of hybrid electric vehicles, natural gas vehicles, propane vehicles or other energy-efficient motor vehicle or low-emission vehicles; or additional methods that reduce harmful emissions as may be approved by the department of general services, thereby reducing the amount of harmful emissions.(c)No plan shall impede mission fulfillment of the entity and every plan shall allow for changes in vehicle usage and total miles driven and provide exceptions for technological or budgetary limitations and emergencies. Technological exceptions may include, but not be limited to, that the entity's vehicles will be operating primarily in an area in which there is no refueling station established for alternative fuels.(d)For purposes of this section:(1)\"Energy-efficient motor vehicle\" means a passenger motor vehicle that is:(A)An alternative fuel vehicle as defined by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486);(B)A flexible fuel vehicle (FFV) utilizing ethanol, biodiesel, or any other commercially available alternative fuel approved by the United States department of energy;(C)A hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV);(D)A compact fuel-efficient vehicle, defined as a vehicle powered by unleaded gasoline that has a United States EPA estimated highway gasoline mileage rating of at least twenty-five miles per gallon (25 mpg) or greater for the model year purchased;(E)An electric vehicle (EV);(F)A vehicle powered by natural gas or propane; or(G)A vehicle powered by ultra low sulfur diesel fuel that meets Bin 5, Tier II emission standards mandated by the EPA and that has an EPA estimated highway mileage rating of at least thirty miles per gallon (30 mpg) or greater for the model year purchased; and(2)\"Motor vehicle\" means a self-propelled vehicle licensed for highway use.Amended by 2014 Tenn.
