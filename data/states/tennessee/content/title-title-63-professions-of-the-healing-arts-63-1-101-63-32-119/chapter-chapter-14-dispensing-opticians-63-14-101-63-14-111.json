The fee imposed for any license under the alternative interval method for a period of other than twenty-four (24) months shall be proportionate to the annual fee and modified in no other manner, except that the proportional fee shall be rounded off to the nearest quarter of a dollar (25¢).(2)No renewal application will be accepted after the last day of the month following the license expiration date under the alternative method authorized in this subsection (d).Acts 1955, ch. 98, § 6; 1976, ch. 402, § 1; 1976, ch. 406, § 4; 1976, ch. 470, § 1; 1979, ch. 66, § 2; T.C.A., §63-1406; Acts 1989, ch. 360, §§ 46-48; 1989, ch. 523, §§ 22-26; 1990, ch. 785, § 1.\n\n(a)Each year, each and every licensed dispensing optician shall pay to the secretary-treasurer of the board an annual renewal fee to be fixed by the board. The secretary of the board shall notify the holder of each license that the renewal fee is due, and the failure to pay such renewal fee by any license holder at the expiration of sixty (60) days after the renewal fee was due constitutes a violation of this chapter.(b)All applicants for licensure shall include with their application a nonrefundable application fee to be set by the board. Applicants who are accepted for examination shall pay an examination fee as set by the board prior to taking the examination, and the examination fee shall be paid in a manner prescribed by the board. Any applicant failing to pass the examination may apply to take a successive examination by submitting to the board a successive application for examination, which shall be accompanied by an examination fee as set by the board. The fee required to be paid by all persons successfully passing the examination shall be fixed annually by the board, and no license or certificate shall be issued until the fee has been fully paid. All such licenses shall be subject to renewal upon the same terms and conditions as prescribed in this chapter with respect to the issuance of original licenses and renewals thereof.(c)All applicants for apprenticeship shall include with their application a nonrefundable fee, to be set by the board.(d)(1)Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the division, with the approval of the commissioner, shall establish a system of license renewals at alternative intervals that will allow for the distribution of the license workload as uniformly as is practicable throughout the calendar year. Licenses issued under the alternative method are valid for twenty-four (24) months and shall expire on the last day of the last month of the license period.
