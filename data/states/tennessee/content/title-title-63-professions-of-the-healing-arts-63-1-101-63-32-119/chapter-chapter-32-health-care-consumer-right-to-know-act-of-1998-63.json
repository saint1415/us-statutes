Misdemeanor convictions later expunged by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be stricken from the provider's profile;(2)A description of any final board disciplinary actions within the most recent ten (10) years, which actions shall include final board action as defined by §4-5-314, and reprimand action taken pursuant to a board practice act;(3)A description of any final disciplinary actions of licensing boards in other states within the most recent ten (10) years;(4)A description of revocation or involuntary restriction of hospital privileges for reasons related to competence or character that has been taken by the hospital's governing body or any other official action of the hospital after procedural due process has been afforded, or the resignation from or nonrenewal of medical staff membership or the restriction of privileges at a hospital taken in lieu of or in settlement of a pending disciplinary case related to competence or character in that hospital, all as taken pursuant to procedures promulgated by the board for licensing health care facilities.

Each provider licensing board shall set by rule adopted pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, a threshold amount below which judgments or settlements shall not be reportable; provided, such threshold shall, for chapter 6 or 9 of this title licensees, be set at seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000), for doctors of chiropractic, regulated pursuant to chapter 4 of this title, be set at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), for dentists, regulated pursuant to chapter 5 of this title, be set at twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), and for all other licensees under this title be set at ten thousand dollars ($10,000).

Nothing in this subdivision (a)(5) shall be construed to prevent a board from investigating and disciplining a licensee on the basis of health care liability claims that are pending;(6)Names of medical schools or professional and training schools and dates of graduation;(7)Graduate medical education or other graduate-level training;(8)Specialty board certification as determined by the relevant board;(9)Names of the hospitals where the licensee has privileges;(10)Appointments to medical school faculties and indication as to whether a licensee has a responsibility for graduate medical education within the most recent ten (10) years;(11)Information regarding publications in peer-reviewed medical literature;(12)Information regarding professional or community service associations, activities and awards;(13)The location of the licensee's primary practice setting;(14)The identification of any translating services that may be available at the licensee's primary practice location;(15)An indication of which managed care plans in which the licensee participates;(16)An indication of TennCare plans in which the licensee participates;(17)No information that is otherwise privileged under this title, and that is generated by any peer review program, provider health program, or impaired professionals program operated or administered by a provider association or foundation that such association has created for peer review purposes, shall be included in any profile unless such information is not contemplated by the particular title 63 statute as being privileged;(18)For the profile of a holder of a certificate of fitness pursuant to §63-7-123, the name of the holder's collaborating physician; and(19)For any physician assistant licensed under §63-19-105, the name of the assistant's collaborating physician.(b)Each board shall provide individual licensees with a copy of their profiles prior to release to the public.

In collecting information for such profiles and in disseminating such profiles, each board shall inform providers that they may choose not to provide such information required pursuant to subdivisions (a)(10)-(12), inclusive.(d)The department shall develop formats for dissemination of such information to the public, which, at a minimum shall include electronic media, including the world wide web of the internet, and a toll-free telephone line.(e)On or before January 1, 1999, the division of health related boards of the department shall become a participant in the national practitioners databank.(f)Individual profiles posted pursuant to §63-32-107shall not contain the licensee's home address and social security number, unless such home address is provided by the licensee, along with a request that it be contained in the profile, as their official mailing or practice address.
