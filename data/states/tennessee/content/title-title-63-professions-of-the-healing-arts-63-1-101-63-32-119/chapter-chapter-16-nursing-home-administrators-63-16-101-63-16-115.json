The board or hearing officer designated as such by the board, acting in an official capacity, has the authority to issue subpoenas, compel the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths and take testimony concerning all matters within the jurisdiction of the board. The board is not bound by the strict rules of evidence in the conduct of its proceedings, but any determinations made shall be founded upon sufficient legal evidence to sustain them.(c)If the board determines that a person is guilty of the charges, the board may direct revocation of the person's license and/or revoke the person's registration, suspend the person from practice or otherwise discipline the licensee.(d)In all disciplinary proceedings of a licensee, the holder shall be given thirty (30) days' written notice of the hearing. The Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, apply to all disciplinary proceedings of the board and all regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter.(e)If the board suspends the licensee, it may also specify conditions to be met by the licensee during the period of suspension in order to entitle the licensee to again qualify for the license. The board may, in its discretion, after hearing, hold the case under advisement and make a recommendation as to the requirements to be met by the licensee in order to avoid suspension, revocation or other disciplinary actions. In such cases the board shall enter an order accordingly and notify the licensee by registered mail. If the licensee complies with such order and proves that fact to the satisfaction of the board, the board may enter an order showing satisfactory compliance in dismissing the case because of such compliance.(f)The board may, in its discretion, certify for licensure and/or registration any person whose license and/or registration has been revoked. Application for the reissuance of a license and/or registration shall not be made prior to one (1) year after revocation, and shall be made in such manner as the board may direct. Any licensee or applicant for a license aggrieved by the action of the board may have such action reviewed pursuant to title 27, chapter 9.(g)An action taken under this section shall be subject to the applicable provisions of the Fresh Start Act that are compiled in chapter 1, part 1 of this title.Amended by 2018 Tenn.
