If an application by the applicant to a particular agency would not otherwise require a hearing, such agency shall not be included in the consolidated hearing and no action taken in the consolidated hearing shall delay such application.(b)The consolidated hearing is intended to combine public hearings concerned with similar regulatory topics, e.g., water quality, into one (1) hearing, thus avoiding the need for additional individual hearings. Issues to be considered in the hearing must be common to each agency and clearly indicated in the agenda and public notice. A common hearing procedure must be developed that satisfies due process and individual agency statutes. One (1) hearing record should be prepared for use by each agency.(c)Procedural and organizational arrangements for the hearing should be made as far in advance as possible.
