The comments and/or recommendations of the board of directors shall not be binding on these governmental units, but shall be viewed as advisory as are those of other reviewing bodies, such as local planning commissions. Review by the board of directors of items in subdivisions (c)(2) and (3) shall be based on the regional council's adopted regional goals, strategies, policies, standards and plans.(e)The review process as outlined in subdivision (c)(4) may be initiated by any of the following means:(1)A mayor or county mayor and/or legislative body whose city or county will be impacted by the project can request the review in accordance with procedures established by the board of directors;(2)The planning staff of any jurisdiction in which the project is proposed to be located and/or the planning commission that has jurisdiction over the review, recommendation or approval of the project;(3)The board of directors may request review of the proposed project; or(4)Any agency, commission or department of the state of Tennessee, adjoining state or federal government may request the regional council to review the project.(f)The board of directors' review, comments and/or recommendations regarding a regional impact project will be based on compatibility and consistency with regional goals, strategies, policies and plans, and it will also be based on an analysis of the probable impacts of the regional impact project. The impact analysis is designed to be an aid and an information source for mayors, county mayors, planning staffs, local planning commissions, city councils, and boards of county commissioners, state and federal agencies, commissions and departments in their evaluations of a project and an aid for adjacent jurisdictions to coordinate and plan for impacts that are created by these projects.(g)The review and recommendations process as outlined in subdivisions (c)(3) and (4) shall be completed by the board of directors within a maximum of thirty (30) days after its submission to the board of directors.

If the project, grant or loan application is received by the board of directors less than fifteen (15) days prior to its next meeting, it will be placed on the agenda of the next subsequent meeting. If the board of directors fails to respond to a project, grant or loan application by failing to make a review and recommendation or fails to call for a public hearing within the thirty (30) days after its submittal, it is deemed acceptable or of no regional impact. The thirty-day review period may be extended, if the board of directors finds it is appropriate to do so in the public interest in order to conduct a public hearing. The review and recommendation of the board of directors on regional impact projects is an advisory function only. The ability to approve, modify or disapprove a regional impact project is wholly and completely within the jurisdiction of the local government in which the project is proposed to be located.Amended by 2022 Tenn.
