The counties of Decatur, Hardin, Perry and Wayne may, in all respects, provide for the rights of the holders of all bonds, including the manner in which future bonds may be issued on a parity with such bonds. The counties of Decatur, Hardin, Perry and Wayne shall follow the procedures for the issuance of bonds established in title 9, chapter 21. Prior to the issuance of any general obligation bonds by any county under the authority of this chapter, a referendum shall be held concurrently with a general election in the county. The substance of a resolution adopted pursuant to §9-21-205shall be printed on the ballot. In order for the bonds to be issued, three-fourths (¾) of the votes cast shall answer the following question affirmatively:Question: Do you favor the guarantee of the bonds issued pursuant to the above resolution:For ( )Against ( )(2)The ballots shall be counted and returns made and canvassed as provided by law for other elections and the results certified to the secretary of state, who shall publicly proclaim the results.(3)The bonds to be issued by the port authority shall be authorized by resolution of the county legislative body or bodies of such county or counties and may be issued in one (1) or more series, may bear such date or dates, may mature at such time or times, not exceeding forty (40) years from their respective dates, may be in such denomination or denominations, may be in such form, either coupon or registered, may carry such registration and conversion privileges, may be executed in such manner, may be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, may be sold or hypothecated in such blocks, may be subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium, may be declared or become due after the maturity date thereof, and may be in such amount as may be provided by resolution of the legislative body of a participating county. Such bonds may be issued for money or property, at public or private sale, for such price and at such rate of interest and may be hypothecated in such manner as the counties may determine; but the interest cost to maturity of the bonds, when issued for property, at the value determined by the counties, which determination shall be conclusive, or the money received for any issue of such bonds shall not exceed the maximum rate fixed by law, payable semiannually. Such bonds shall have all the qualities and incidents of negotiability.(4)Pending the preparation of the definitive bonds, interim receipts or certificates in such form, and with such provisions, as provided in the resolution authorizing such bonds, may be issued to the purchaser or purchasers of bonds sold pursuant to this chapter. The bonds and interim receipts or certificates shall be fully negotiable.(5)In case any of the officers whose signatures or countersignatures appear on such bonds cease to be officers before the delivery of the bonds, the signatures and countersignatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as though such officers had remained in office until the bonds had been delivered.(6)The bonds may be issued, notwithstanding and without regard to any limit or restriction on the amount or percentage of indebtedness or of outstanding obligations of the participating counties of Decatur, Hardin, Perry and Wayne contained in any other statute, general or special, and notwithstanding and without regard to the requirements of any other general or special statute, including requirements as to elections for the approval of such bonds.(7)Prior to a vote by the county legislative body of counties authorizing the issuance of bonds to be financed wholly or in part through tax levies by the county legislative body, the board of commissioners shall prepare and submit to the county legislative body of each of the counties of Decatur, Hardin, Perry and Wayne a recommendation that bonds in a stated amount be issued under this part, supported by a report on the need for and projected use of the facilities for the financing of which such bond issue is proposed, including a review of alternate solutions, if any, and a justification of the solution proposed.(8)Bonds may be issued as direct and general obligations of each of the counties of Decatur, Hardin, Perry and Wayne payable out of their several and separate general income and revenue. Bonds may also be issued as obligations of the port authority payable out of the revenues of the port authority. In case the bonds are issued as general obligations of the counties, it is the duty of the county legislative body of each of the counties to levy a tax each year, over and above the taxes levied for general county purposes and other special county purposes, to pay the interest and principal of the bonds as they mature. In case the revenues derived from the operation of the facilities provided for in this chapter are sufficient to pay the principal and interest of such bonds, or a part thereof, as they may severally mature, then a special levy for the full payment of such principal and interest shall not be required; but the county legislative bodies shall each year levy an amount of tax, which, when added to the account of revenue derived from the operation of the facilities then on hand and available for that purpose, will be sufficient to pay the principal and interest maturing prior to the collection of the next succeeding tax levy. The bonds shall be sold at public or private sale and in such manner as may be determined by resolution of each of the county legislative bodies authorizing their issuance. The bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to and in accordance with this chapter, and such recital shall be conclusive evidence of their legality.(c)Prior to the adoption by the governing body of the port authority or any one (1) or more of the participating counties of Decatur, Hardin, Perry and Wayne of the resolution authorizing the issuance of any bonds under this chapter, a plan of financing shall be submitted to the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee for review; and the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee may report thereon to the governing body of the port authority or of the appropriate county or counties within fifteen (15) days from the date the plan is received and shall immediately acknowledge receipt in writing of the proposed financing plan.
