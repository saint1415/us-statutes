Where only a portion of a section appears, such portion is deemed to be either in substitution of the same portion appearing in the Tennessee Code or prior supplemental reenactments or an addition to such section. Where section numbers of the Tennessee Code or supplemental reenactments are followed by \"Repealed\" or \"Superseded\", they are deemed repealed unless limiting or restricting language follows the word \"Repealed\" or \"Superseded\", in which latter event such repeal or supersession shall be limited or restricted in accordance with such language. Where section numbers of the Tennessee Code or supplemental reenactments are followed by \"Unconstitutional\" or are noted as having been found unconstitutional, this is reflective of a definitive court decision on the constitutionality of that section.

held in the years 1955 through 2024 which were codified therein. The sections so reenacted shall be construed as continuations of the previous laws so reenacted, and pending litigation, criminal prosecutions and statutes of limitations shall not be affected by such reenactments.(3)Each section of the supplemental reenactments bearing the same number as a section appearing in the Tennessee Code as enacted in 1955 or in prior supplemental reenactments of the code is deemed to be in substitution for such section. Where only a portion of a section appears, such portion is deemed to be either in substitution of the same portion appearing in the Tennessee Code or prior supplemental reenactments or an addition to such section. Where section numbers of the Tennessee Code or supplemental reenactments are followed by \"Repealed\" or \"Superseded\", they are deemed repealed unless limiting or restricting language follows the word \"Repealed\" or \"Superseded\", in which latter event such repeal or supersession shall be limited or restricted in accordance with such language. Where section numbers of the Tennessee Code or supplemental reenactments are followed by \"Unconstitutional\" or are noted as having been found unconstitutional, this is reflective of a definitive court decision on the constitutionality of that section. Clauses, preambles, captions, statements of legislative intent, severability or reverse-severability clauses omitted from codification pursuant to §1-1-108, remain valid in construing legislative intent of the codified portions of the act notwithstanding that the omitted portions of the act were not codified.(4)All public acts of a general and permanent nature, to the extent codified in this act and the supplemental reenactments set out in subdivision (b)(1), which were passed prior to the 2024 session of the general assembly and after the 1953 session are repealed, except chapters 6 and 121 of the Public Acts of 1955, all of the supplemental reenactments set out in subdivision (b)(1), and those laws excepted by §1-2-105of the Tennessee Code.(5)The enrolled draft of each supplemental reenactment shall, upon approval of the statute by the governor, be deposited in the office of the secretary of state, and shall be carefully preserved by that officer as an official enactment of supplemental material to the Tennessee Code.(6)Title 47 of the Tennessee Code as enacted by chapter 6 of the Public Acts of 1955, as amended and supplemented by chapter 1 of the Public Acts of 1961 and chapter 1 of the Public Acts of 1963, is repealed in its entirety except as provided in [former] § 47-1-110 [repealed]; provided, that the sections appearing in title 47, chapters 11-15 in the reenactment by chapter 1 of the Public Acts of 1965 shall be construed as continuations of the similar sections appearing in the former title 47, and pending litigation, criminal prosecutions and statutes of limitation shall not be affected by such repeal and reenactment.(7)In case any act or portion of an act codified and reenacted as provided in subdivision (b)(1) is thereafter deleted from this code for reasons other than repeal, supersession, or unconstitutionality, the original act or portion of an act so removed from the code shall be revived and continued in the same force and effect it had as a separate act prior to codification, notwithstanding any action occurring under subsection (a).(8)Legislative intent or effect which is dependent on the proposed placement of an act in the Tennessee Code shall not be affected by the actual codification of such material, and the general repealer contained in subdivision (a)(4) shall not affect such presumed intent.T.C.A., § 1-214; Acts 1980, ch. 444, §§ 1, 2; 1981, ch. 1, §§ 1, 2; 1982, ch. 543, § 1; 1983, ch. 1, § 1; 1984, ch. 483, §1; 1985, ch. 2, § 1; 1986, ch. 523, § 1; 1986, ch. 786, § 1; 1987, ch. 4, § 1; 1988, ch. 458, § 1; 1989, ch. 5, § 1; 1990, ch. 668, § 1; 1991, ch. 28, § 1; 1992, ch. 528, § 1; 1993, ch. 1, § 1; 1994, ch. 543, § 1; 1995, ch. 1, § 1; 1996, ch. 554, §1; 1997 , ch. 1, § 1; 1998, ch. 574, §1; 1999, ch. 235, § 1; 2000, ch. 574, § 1; 2001, ch. 52, §1; 2002, ch. 491, §1; 2003 , ch. 1, § 1; 2004, ch. 437, §1; 2005, ch. 1, § 1; 2006, ch. 507, §1; 2007 , ch. 1, § 1; 2008 , ch. 607, § 1; 2009 , ch. 2, § 1; 2010 , ch. 624, § 1; 2011 , ch. 41, § 1; 2012 , ch. 582, § 1.\n\nT.C.A., § 1-214; Acts 1980, ch. 444, §§ 1, 2; 1981, ch. 1, §§ 1, 2; 1982, ch. 543, § 1; 1983, ch. 1, § 1; 1984, ch. 483, §1; 1985, ch. 2, § 1; 1986, ch. 523, § 1; 1986, ch. 786, § 1; 1987, ch. 4, § 1; 1988, ch. 458, § 1; 1989, ch. 5, § 1; 1990, ch. 668, § 1; 1991, ch. 28, § 1; 1992, ch. 528, § 1; 1993, ch. 1, § 1; 1994, ch. 543, § 1; 1995, ch. 1, § 1; 1996, ch. 554, §1; 1997 , ch. 1, § 1; 1998, ch. 574, §1; 1999, ch. 235, § 1; 2000, ch. 574, § 1; 2001, ch. 52, §1; 2002, ch. 491, §1; 2003 , ch. 1, § 1; 2004, ch. 437, §1; 2005, ch. 1, § 1; 2006, ch. 507, §1; 2007 , ch. 1, § 1; 2008 , ch. 607, § 1; 2009 , ch. 2, § 1; 2010 , ch. 624, § 1; 2011 , ch. 41, § 1; 2012 , ch. 582, § 1.",
