Each risk retention group shall disclose these determinations to its domestic regulator, at least annually. For purposes of this subdivision (d)(1)(B), any person who is a direct or indirect owner of or subscriber in the risk retention group (or is an officer, director, or employee of such an owner and insured, unless some other position of such officer, director, or employee constitutes a material relationship), as contemplated by15 U.S.C. § 3901(a)(4)(E)(ii)of the Liability Risk Retention Act, is considered to be \"independent;\"(2)Service Provider Contracts.(A)The term of any material service provider contract with the risk retention group shall not exceed five (5) years.

The risk retention group's board of directors shall have the right to terminate any service provider, audit or actuarial contract at any time for cause after providing adequate notice pursuant to the terms of the contract. The service provider contract is deemed material if the amount to be paid for such contract is greater than or equal to five percent (5%) of the risk retention group's annual gross written premium or two percent (2%) of its surplus, whichever is greater;(B)No service provider contract constituting a material relationship shall be entered into unless the risk retention group has notified the commissioner in writing of its intention to enter into such transaction at least thirty (30) days prior to entering into the proposed transaction and the commissioner has not disapproved it within such period;(3)Written Policy.The risk retention group's board of directors shall adopt a written policy in the plan of operation as approved by the board that requires the board to:(A)Assure that all owner and insureds of the risk retention group receive evidence of ownership interest;(B)Develop a set of governance standards applicable to the risk retention group;(C)Oversee the evaluation of the risk retention group's management, including, but not limited to, the performance of the captive manager, managing general underwriter or other party or parties responsible for underwriting, determination of rates, collection of premium, adjusting or settling claims, or the preparation of financial statements;(D)Review and approve the amount to be paid to material service providers; and(E)Review and approve, at least annually:(i)The risk retention group's goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of officers and service providers;(ii)The officers' and service providers' performance in accordance with those goals and objectives; and(iii)The continued engagement of the officers and material service providers;(4)Audit Committee.(A)The risk retention group shall have an audit committee composed of at least three (3) independent board members. A non-independent board member may participate in the activities of the audit committee, if invited by the members, but cannot be a member of such committee;(B)The audit committee shall have a written charter that defines the committee's purpose, which, at a minimum, must be to:(i)Assist board oversight of the:(a)Integrity of the risk retention group's financial statements;(b)Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and(c)Qualifications, independence, and performance of the independent auditor and actuary;(ii)Discuss the annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with management;(iii)Discuss the annual audited financial statements with the independent auditor and, if advisable, discuss quarterly financial statements with the independent auditor;(iv)Discuss policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management;(v)Meet separately and periodically, either directly or through a designated representative of the committee, with management and independent auditors;(vi)Review with the independent auditor any audit problems or difficulties and management's response;(vii)Set clear hiring policies of the risk retention group regarding the hiring of employees or former employees of the independent auditor;(viii)Require the external auditor to rotate the lead (or coordinating) audit partner having primary responsibility for the risk retention group's audit as well as the audit partner responsible for reviewing that audit so that neither individual performs audit services for a particular risk retention group for more than five (5) consecutive fiscal years; and(ix)Report regularly to the board of directors;(C)The domestic regulator may waive the requirement to establish an audit committee composed of independent board members if the risk retention group is able to demonstrate to the domestic regulator that it is impracticable to do so and the risk retention group's board of directors itself is otherwise able to accomplish the purposes of an audit committee, as described in subdivision (d)(4)(B);(5)Governance Standards.The board of directors shall adopt governance standards and shall make such standards available electronically, including, but not limited to, posting such information on the risk retention group's web site, or by other means, and provide such information to members/insureds upon request.
