The officers, directors, employees and agents of the licensee or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees or agents, to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the commissioner shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the licensee to engage in the viatical settlement business or other business subject to the commissioner's jurisdiction. Any proceedings for suspension, revocation or refusal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to §56-2-305.(3)The commissioner shall have the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths and to examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the examination. Upon the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court.(4)When making an examination under this chapter, the commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the examination.(5)Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend an examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state.

All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed or presented, shall be the responsibility of the viatical settlement licensees, as well as the individual who created or presented the advertisement.

The form and content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement, product or service shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It shall not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be determined by the commissioner from the overall impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.(d)Certain viatical settlement advertisements are deemed false and misleading on their face and are prohibited. False and misleading viatical settlement advertisements include, but are not limited to, the following representations:(1)\"Guaranteed\", \"fully secured\", \"100 percent secured\", \"fully insured\", \"secure\", \"safe\", \"backed by rated insurance companies\", \"backed by federal law\", \"backed by state law\", or \"state guaranty funds\" or similar representations;(2)\"No risk\", \"minimal risk\", \"low risk\", \"no speculation\", \"no fluctuation\" or similar representations;(3)\"Qualified or approved for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, 401(k) plans, simplified employee pensions (SEP), 403(b), Keogh plans, tax sheltered annuity TSA, other retirement account rollovers\", \"tax deferred\" or similar representations;(4)Utilization of the word \"guaranteed\" to describe the fixed return, annual return, principal, earnings, profits, investment or similar representations;(5)\"No sales charges or fees\" or similar representations;(6)\"High yield\", \"superior return\", \"excellent return\", \"high return\", \"quick profit\" or similar representations; and(7)Purported favorable representations or testimonials about the benefits of viatical settlement contracts or viatical settlement purchase agreements as an investment, taken out of context from newspapers, trade papers, journals, radio and television programs and all other forms of print and electronic media.(e)The information required to be disclosed under this chapter shall not be minimized, rendered obscure or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading.(1)An advertisement shall not omit material information or use words, phrases, statements, references or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving viators, purchasers or prospective purchasers as to the nature or extent of any benefit, loss covered, premium payable or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not satisfied or that the viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement includes a \"free look\" period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy misleading statements.(2)An advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the insurer.(3)An advertisement shall not represent that premium payments will not be required to be paid on the life insurance policy that is the subject of a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement in order to maintain that policy, unless that is the fact.(4)An advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable or in any manner an incorrect or improper practice.(5)The words \"free\", \"no cost\", \"without cost\", \"no additional cost\", \"at no extra cost\" or words of similar import shall not be used with respect to any benefit or service unless true. An advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may state that a charge is included in the payment or use other appropriate language.(6)(A)Testimonials, appraisals or analysis used in advertisements must:(i)Be genuine;(ii)Represent the current opinion of the author;(iii)Be applicable to the viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement, product or service advertised, if any; and(iv)Be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective viators or purchasers as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisal, analysis or endorsement.(B)In using testimonials, appraisals or analysis, a licensee under this chapter makes as its own all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to this section.(C)If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis or an endorsement has a financial interest in the party making use of the testimonial, appraisal, analysis or endorsement, either directly or through a related entity as a stockholder, director, officer, employee or otherwise, or receives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement.(D)An advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement, benefit or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the viatical settlement licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled or managed by the viatical settlement licensee, or receives any payment or other consideration from the viatical settlement licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement.(E)When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical settlement contract or viatical settlement purchase agreement, all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of five (5) years after its use.(f)An advertisement shall not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and relevant facts.
