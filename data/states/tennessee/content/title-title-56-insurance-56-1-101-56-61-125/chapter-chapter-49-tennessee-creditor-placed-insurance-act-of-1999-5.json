Rates are not unfairly discriminatory because different premiums result for different policyholders, including group policyholders, with similar loss exposures but different expense factors or similar expense factors but different loss exposures, nor are rates unfairly discriminatory if they are averaged broadly among all persons insured in this state or all persons insured under a group insurance policy.(f)The commissioner may withdraw approval of an approved form or schedule of premium rates when the commissioner would be required to disapprove the form or schedule of premium rates if it were filed at the time of the withdrawal.
