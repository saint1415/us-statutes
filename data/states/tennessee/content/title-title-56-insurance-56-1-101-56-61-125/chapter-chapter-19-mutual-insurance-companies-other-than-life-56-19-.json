The equity shall be based upon not less than the insurer's entire surplus, after deducting contributed or borrowed surplus funds and any outstanding guaranty capital securities, plus a reasonable present equity in its reserves and in all nonadmitted assets;(4)The policyholders entitled to receive stock upon conversion and to participate in the purchase of additional stock, if any, include all policyholders having policies in force on the date of conversion;(5)The plan provides that each policyholder of the insurer specified in subdivision (a)(4) shall receive a proportionate part of the capital stock to be issued in respect to the policyholders' equity. The plan also gives to each such policyholder a nontransferable preemptive right to acquire a proportionate part of any additional capital stock to be issued and sold by the insurer, within a designated reasonable period. In addition to the issuance of shares with respect to the policyholders' equity, if the insurer has outstanding guaranty capital securities, the plan shall require the sale of a sufficient number of shares (at the same price per share as all other shares issued under the plan) to retire the guaranty capital securities. To the extent each policyholder specified in subdivision (4) does not exercise the preemptive right to purchase a pro rata number of shares to retire the guaranty capital securities, the holders of the guaranty capital securities shall have the right to convert the securities, including all accrued interest, into shares of capital stock at such price;(6)Shares are so offered to policyholders at a price not greater than that thereafter offered to others nor at more than five (5) times the par value of the shares; and(7)The plan, when completed, would provide for the converted insurer paid-in capital stock in an amount not less than the minimum paid-in capital required of a state stock insurer under this chapter; provided, that this provision does not apply to any converting mutual companies that were qualified and authorized under this chapter prior to May 7, 1969.(b)(1)As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:(A)\"Commissioner\" is the commissioner of commerce and insurance;(B)\"Converted stock company\" is a Tennessee domiciled stock company that converted from a Tennessee domiciled mutual company under this section;(C)\"Eligible member\" is a member whose policy is in force as of the date the mutual company's board of directors adopts a plan of conversion. A person whose policy is issued after the board of directors adopts the plan but before the plan's effective date is not an eligible member but shall have those rights set forth in subdivision (b)(10); and(D)\"Plan of conversion\" or \"plan\" is a plan adopted by a Tennessee domestic mutual company's board of directors under this section to convert the mutual company into a Tennessee domiciled stock company.(2)(A)A mutual company seeking to convert to a stock company shall, by the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds (2/3) of its board of directors, adopt a plan of conversion consistent with the requirements of subdivision (b)(6).(B)At any time before approval of a plan by the commissioner, the mutual company by the affirmative vote of two thirds (2/3) of its board of directors, may amend or withdraw the plan.(3)(A)After adoption by the mutual company's board of directors, the plan shall be submitted to the commissioner for review and approval. The commissioner shall approve the plan upon finding that:(i)This subsection (b) has been complied with;(ii)The plan will not prejudice the interests of the members; and(iii)The plan's method of allocating subscription rights is fair and equitable.(B)(i)(a)Prior to the members' approval of the plan, a mutual company seeking the commissioner's approval of a plan shall file the following documents with the commissioner for review and approval:(1)The plan of conversion, including the independent evaluation of pro forma market value required by subdivision (b)(6)(F);(2)The form of notice required by subdivision (b)(4)(B) for eligible members of the meeting to vote on the plan;(3)Any proxies to be solicited from eligible members pursuant to subdivision (b)(4)(C)(ii);(4)The form of notice required by subdivision (b)(10)(A) for persons whose policies are issued after adoption of the plan but before the plan's effective date; and(5)The proposed charter and bylaws of the converted stock company.(b)Once filed, these documents shall be approved or disapproved by the commissioner within a reasonable time.(ii)After the members have approved the plan, the converted stock company shall file the following documents with the commissioner:(a)The minutes of the meeting of the members at which the plan was voted upon; and(b)The revised charter and bylaws of the converted stock company.(C)The commissioner may retain, at the mutual company's expense, any qualified expert not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff to assist in reviewing the plan and the independent evaluation of the pro forma market value that is required by subdivision (b)(6)(F).(4)(A)All eligible members shall be given notice of and an opportunity to vote upon the plan.(B)All eligible members shall be given notice of the members' meeting to vote upon the plan. A copy of the plan or a summary of the plan shall accompany the notice. The notice shall be mailed to each member's last known address, as shown on the mutual company's records, within forty-five (45) days of the commissioner's approval of the plan. The meeting to vote upon the plan shall not be set for a date less than sixty (60) days after the date when the notice of the meeting is mailed by the mutual company. If the meeting to vote upon the plan is held coincident with the mutual company's annual meeting of policyholders, only one (1) combined notice of meeting is required.(C)(i)After approval by the commissioner, the plan shall be adopted upon receiving the affirmative vote of at least two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast by eligible members.(ii)Members entitled to vote upon the proposed plan may vote in person or by proxy. Any proxies to be solicited from eligible members shall be filed with and approved by the commissioner.(iii)The number of votes each eligible member may cast shall be determined by the mutual company's bylaws. If the bylaws are silent, each eligible member may cast one (1) vote.(5)Adoption of the revised charter of the converted stock company is necessary to implement the plan and shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the general corporation law. The revised charter may be adopted solely by the board of directors.(6)The following provisions shall be included in the plan:(A)The plan shall set forth the reasons for the proposed conversion;(B)(i)The plan shall provide that all policies in force on the effective date of conversion shall continue to remain in force under the terms of those policies, except that any voting rights of the policyholders provided for under the policies or under this code, and any contingent liability policy provisions of the type described in §56-19-116shall be extinguished on the effective date of the conversion;(ii)The plan shall further provide that holders of participating policies in effect on the date of conversion shall continue to have the right to receive dividends as provided in the participating policies, if any;(iii)The converted stock company may issue the insured a nonparticipating policy as a substitute for a participating policy upon the renewal date of a participating policy;(C)(i)The plan shall provide that each eligible member is to receive, without payment, nontransferable subscription rights to purchase a portion of the capital stock of the converted stock company. As an alternative to subscription rights in the converted stock company, the plan may provide that each eligible member is to receive, without payment, nontransferable subscription rights to purchase a portion of the capital stock of:(a)A corporation organized and owned by the mutual company for the purpose of purchasing and holding all the stock of the converted stock company; or(b)A stock insurance company owned by the mutual company into which the mutual company will be merged;(ii)The subscription rights shall be allocated in whole shares among the eligible members using a fair and equitable formula.
