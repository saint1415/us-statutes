Such projects may include a project under section 319 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, an H2Ohio project, a water resource restoration sponsor program, a wetland mitigation bank, or an in-lieu fee mitigation project. To qualify under this exception, a person shall submit a demonstration as part of a mitigation proposal that the project will result in a net improvement in water quality.(B) A project for the filling or discharge of dredged material into an ephemeral feature that is a water of the state that impacts three one-hundredths of an acre or less of streambed. For purposes of this division, if culvert maintenance or replacement is involved in the project, only an impact to an ephemeral feature that is a water of the state that goes beyond the enclosed configuration of the existing culvert structure shall be included in the calculation of the impacted streambed acreage.",
