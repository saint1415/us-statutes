This term does not encompass a convention for proposing amendments under Article V of the Constitution of the United States that is organized independently of this Compact based on the separate and distinct application of any State.Section 3.\"State\" means one of the several States of the United States. Where contextually appropriate, the term \"State\" shall be construed to include all of its branches, departments, agencies, political subdivisions, and officers and representatives acting in their official capacity.Section 4.\"Member State\" means a State that has enacted, adopted and agreed to be bound to this Compact. For any State to qualify as a Member State with respect to any other State under this Compact, each such State must have enacted, adopted and agreed to be bound by substantively identical compact legislation.Section 5.\"Compact Notice Recipients\" means the Archivist of the United States, the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Office of the Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Office of the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the chief executive officer of each State, and the presiding officer(s) of each house of the Legislatures of the several States.Section 6.Notice. All notices required by this Compact shall be by U.S. Certified Mail, return receipt requested, or an equivalent or superior form of notice, such as personal delivery documented by evidence of actual receipt.Section 7.\"Balanced Budget Amendment\" means the following:\"Article ____________________Section 1.Total outlays of the government of the United States shall not exceed total receipts of the government of the United States at any point in time unless the excess of outlays over receipts is financed exclusively by debt issued in strict conformity with this article.Section 2.Outstanding debt shall not exceed authorized debt, which initially shall be an amount equal to one hundred five percent (105%) of the outstanding debt on the effective date of this article. Authorized debt shall not be increased above its aforesaid initial amount unless such increase is first approved by the legislatures of the several states as provided in Section 3.Section 3.From time to time, Congress may increase authorized debt to an amount in excess of its initial amount set by Section 2 only if it first publicly refers to the legislatures of the several states an unconditional, single subject measure proposing the amount of such increase, in such form as provided by law, and the measure is thereafter publicly and unconditionally approved by a simple majority of the legislatures of the several states, in such form as provided respectively by state law; provided that no inducement requiring an expenditure or tax levy shall be demanded, offered or accepted as a quid pro quo for such approval. If such approval is not obtained within sixty (60) calendar days after referral then the measure shall be deemed disapproved and the authorized debt shall thereby remain unchanged.Section 4.Whenever the outstanding debt exceeds ninety-eight percent (98%) of the debt limit set by Section 2, the President shall enforce said limit by publicly designating specific expenditures for impoundment in an amount sufficient to ensure outstanding debt shall not exceed the authorized debt. Said impoundment shall become effective thirty (30) days thereafter, unless Congress first designates an alternate impoundment of the same or greater amount by concurrent resolution, which shall become immediately effective. The failure of the President to designate or enforce the required impoundment is an impeachable misdemeanor. Any purported issuance or incurrence of any debt in excess of the debt limit set by Section 2 is void.Section 5.No bill that provides for a new or increased general revenue tax shall become law unless approved by a two-thirds (2/3) roll call vote of the whole number of each House of Congress. However, this requirement shall not apply to any bill that provides for a new end user sales tax which would completely replace every existing income tax levied by the government of the United States; or for the reduction or elimination of an exemption, deduction, or credit allowed under an existing general revenue tax.Section 6.For purposes of this article, 'debt' means any obligation backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the United States; 'outstanding debt' means all debt held in any account and by any entity at a given point in time; 'authorized debt' means the maximum total amount of debt that may be lawfully issued and outstanding at any single point in time under this article; 'total outlays of the government of the United States' means all expenditures of the government of the United States from any source; 'total receipts of the government of the United States' means all tax receipts and other income of the government of the United States, excluding proceeds from its issuance or incurrence of debt or any type of liability; 'impoundment' means a proposal not to spend all or part of a sum of money appropriated by Congress; and 'general revenue tax' means any income tax, sales tax, or value-added tax levied by the government of the United States excluding imposts and duties.Section 7.This article is immediately operative upon ratification, self-enforcing, and Congress may enact conforming legislation to facilitate enforcement.\"ARTICLE IIICOMPACT MEMBERSHIP AND WITHDRAWALSection 1.This Compact governs each Member State to the fullest extent permitted by their respective constitutions, superseding and repealing any conflicting or contrary law.Section 2.By becoming a Member State, each such State offers, promises and agrees to perform and comply strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Compact, and has made such offer, promise and agreement in anticipation and consideration of, and in substantial reliance upon, such mutual and reciprocal performance and compliance by each other current and future Member State, if any. Accordingly, in addition to having the force of law in each Member State upon its respective effective date, this Compact and each of its Articles shall also be construed as contractually binding each Member State when:(a)at least one other State has likewise become a Member State by enacting substantively identical legislation adopting and agreeing to be bound by this Compact; and(b)notice of such State's Member State status is or has been seasonably received by the Compact Administrator, if any, or otherwise by the chief executive officer of each other Member State.Section 3.For purposes of determining Member State status under this Compact, as long as all other provisions of the Compact remain identical and operative on the same terms, legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this Compact shall be deemed and regarded as \"substantively identical\" with respect to such other legislation enacted by another State notwithstanding:(a)any difference in Section 2 of Article IV with specific regard to the respectively enacting State's own method of appointing its member to the Commission;(b)any difference in Section 5 of Article IV with specific regard to the respectively enacting State's own obligation to fund the Commission;(c)any difference in Sections 1 and 2 of Article VI with specific regard to the number and identity of each delegate respectively appointed on behalf of the enacting State, provided that no more than three (3) delegates may attend and participate in the Convention on behalf of any State; or(d)any difference in Section 7 of Article X with specific regard to the respectively enacting State as to whether Section 1 of Article V of this Compact shall survive termination of the Compact, and thereafter become a continuing resolution of the Legislature of such State applying to Congress for the calling of a convention of the states under Article V of the Constitution of the United States, under such terms and limitations as may be specified by such State.Section 4.When fewer than three-fourths (3/4) of the States are Member States, any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting appropriate legislation, as determined by state law, and giving notice of such withdrawal to the Compact Administrator, if any, or otherwise to the chief executive officer of each other Member State. A withdrawal shall not affect the validity or applicability of the compact with respect to remaining Member States, provided that there remain at least two (2) such States. However, once at least three-fourths (3/4) of the States are Member States, then no Member State may withdraw from the Compact prior to its termination absent unanimous consent of all Member States.ARTICLE IVCOMPACT COMMISSION AND COMPACT ADMINISTRATORSection 1.Nature of the Compact Commission.

However, upon written request by the chief law enforcement officer of any Member State, the Commission may elect to waive this provision for the purpose of ensuring an action proceeds in the venue that allows for the most convenient and effective enforcement or defense of this Compact.
