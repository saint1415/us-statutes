Any center-based or group home child care facility under this subsection shall be licensed by the State Department of Health pursuant to law. When child care is being provided in the child's own home, in the home of a relative of the child, or in any other unlicensed setting, the provision of such child care may be monitored on a random basis by the Department of Human Services or the State Department of Health. Transitional child care assistance may be continued if it is necessary for parents to maintain employment once support has ended, unless prohibited under state or federal law.

State agencies participating in the TANF work program shall receive any and all benefits received by employers in the private sector for hiring TANF recipients.

Not later than September 1, 2021, the department shall prepare a report, which shall be provided to the Chairmen of the House and Senate Public Health Committees and to any other member of the Legislature upon request, on the history, status, outcomes and effectiveness of the information and referral requirements under this subsection.(14)No new TANF program requirement or restriction affecting a person's eligibility for TANF assistance, or allowable work activity, which is not mandated by federal law or regulation may be implemented by the Department of Human Services after July 1, 2004, unless such is specifically authorized by an amendment to this section by the Legislature.Codes, 1942, § 7173; Laws, 1940, ch. 294; Laws, 1944, ch. 292, § 1; Laws, 1957, Ex Sess, ch. 22; Laws, 1962, ch. 559, § 2; Laws, 1968, ch. 562, § 3; Laws, 1978, ch. 303, § 1; Laws, 1985, ch. 383, § 3; Laws, 1993, ch. 614, § 11; Laws, 1994, ch. 582, § 6; Laws, 1997, ch. 316, § 3; Laws, 1999, ch. 390, § 1; Laws, 2004, ch. 572, § 49; Laws, 2006, ch. 547, § 1; Laws, 2008, ch. 533, § 1; reenacted without change, Laws, 2008, 1st Ex Sess, ch. 30, § 49; Laws, 2010, ch. 476, § 72; Laws, 2010, ch. 559, §49; Laws, 2011, ch. 471, § 50; Laws, 2012, ch. 515, § 50, eff. 7/1/2012.Amended by Laws, 2024, ch. 484, HB 4130,§ 112, eff. 7/1/2024.Reenacted without change by Laws, 2023, ch. 510, SB 2810,§ 51, eff. 4/17/2023.Amended by Laws, 2021, ch. 396, SB 2759,§ 1, eff. 3/24/2021.Amended by Laws, 2019, ch. 451, SB 2133,§ 58, eff. 4/3/2019.Reenacted without change by Laws, 2019, ch. 451, SB 2133,§ 49, eff. 4/3/2019.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 430, HB 49, 2, eff. 7/1/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 398, HB 426, 10, eff. 7/1/2014.\n\nThe monthly attendance requirement under this subsection shall be attendance at the school in which the person is enrolled for each day during a month that the school conducts classes in which the person is enrolled, with not more than two (2) absences during the month for reasons other than the reasons listed in paragraph (e)(iv) of this subsection.

The reduction in the calculation of the school district's net enrollment under this paragraph shall be effective for a period of one (1) year.\n\nThe child's parent or caretaker relative (whoever is the primary recipient of the TANF benefits) may request a fair hearing on the department's determination that the child has not been attending school. If the child's parents or caretaker relative does not request a fair hearing under this subsection, or if, after a fair hearing has been held, the hearing officer finds that the child without good cause has failed to meet the monthly attendance requirement, the department shall discontinue or deny TANF benefits to the child thirteen (13) years old, or older, in the next possible payment month. The department shall discontinue or deny twenty-five percent (25%) of the family grant when a child six (6) through twelve (12) years of age without good cause has failed to meet the monthly attendance requirement. Both the child and family sanction may apply when children in both age groups fail to meet the attendance requirement without good cause. A sanction applied under this subsection shall be effective for one (1) month for each month that the child failed to meet the monthly attendance requirement. In the case of a dropout, the sanction shall remain in force until the parent or caretaker relative provides written proof from the school district that the child has reenrolled and met the monthly attendance requirement for one (1) calendar month.

The sanction shall be removed the next possible payment month.\n\nFor a two-parent family, unless prohibited by state or federal law, Medicaid assistance shall be terminated only for the person whose failure to participate in allowable work activity caused the family's TANF assistance to be sanctioned under this paragraph (e), unless an individual is pregnant, but shall not be terminated for any other person in the family who is meeting that person's applicable work requirement or who is not required to work. Minor children shall continue to be eligible for Medicaid benefits regardless of the disqualification of their parent or caretaker relative for TANF assistance under this subsection (6), unless prohibited by state or federal law.\n\nCodes, 1942, § 7173; Laws, 1940, ch. 294; Laws, 1944, ch. 292, § 1; Laws, 1957, Ex Sess, ch. 22; Laws, 1962, ch. 559, § 2; Laws, 1968, ch. 562, § 3; Laws, 1978, ch. 303, § 1; Laws, 1985, ch. 383, § 3; Laws, 1993, ch. 614, § 11; Laws, 1994, ch. 582, § 6; Laws, 1997, ch. 316, § 3; Laws, 1999, ch. 390, § 1; Laws, 2004, ch. 572, § 49; Laws, 2006, ch. 547, § 1; Laws, 2008, ch. 533, § 1; reenacted without change, Laws, 2008, 1st Ex Sess, ch. 30, § 49; Laws, 2010, ch. 476, § 72; Laws, 2010, ch. 559, §49; Laws, 2011, ch. 471, § 50; Laws, 2012, ch. 515, § 50, eff. 7/1/2012.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2024, ch. 484, HB 4130,§ 112, eff. 7/1/2024.\n\nReenacted without change by Laws, 2023, ch. 510, SB 2810,§ 51, eff. 4/17/2023.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2021, ch. 396, SB 2759,§ 1, eff. 3/24/2021.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2019, ch. 451, SB 2133,§ 58, eff. 4/3/2019.\n\nReenacted without change by Laws, 2019, ch. 451, SB 2133,§ 49, eff. 4/3/2019.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2014, ch. 430, HB 49, 2, eff. 7/1/2014.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2014, ch. 398, HB 426, 10, eff. 7/1/2014.",
