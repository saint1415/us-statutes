In said resolution the governing authorities shall direct that the whole or such part of the cost and expense thereof, as they shall fix, shall be assessed against the property abutting upon the improvement, according to the frontage thereof, in the following manner: by taking the number of front feet improved and dividing the total cost of the whole improvement thereby and multiplying the quotient by the number of front feet contained in such abutting lot or pieces of ground; the result shall be assessed by the governing authorities as the amount of the special tax to be assessed against each lot or piece of ground, except that the entire cost of improvements as to sidewalks, curbs, and gutters shall be assessed against the property on which said improvements or any of them abut for its entire frontage only.In the case of water mains, water connections, sanitary sewers or sanitary disposal systems, the said resolution shall provide that the entire cost thereof, or so much of the same as the governing authorities of the municipality shall fix, shall be assessed against either the property benefited or the property on which each such improvement is located, without regard to the front footage of such improvement.Alternatively, in the case of sanitary sewers and sanitary disposal systems, the said resolution may define the entire area to be benefited by the improvement, and may direct that the cost to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land shall be determined by dividing the entire cost thereof by the total number of front feet fronting on all the streets embraced within said improvement area, and multiplying the quotient by the number of feet of street frontage in any particular lot or parcel of land. The result thereof shall be assessed by the governing authorities as the amount of special tax against each lot or piece of ground for the owner's part of the cost of the entire improvement.In the case of storm sewers and surface drains or drainage systems, the said resolution shall clearly define the area to be benefited by the improvement contemplated, and shall determine that the cost of the improvement to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land within said area shall be determined by dividing the entire cost of the improvement by the total number of square feet in the area defined, and multiplying the quotient by the number of square feet contained in any particular lot or parcel of land within said area. The result thereof shall be assessed by the governing authorities as the amount of special tax against each lot or piece of ground as the owner's part of the cost of the entire improvement.

In the event storm or other sewers are constructed under the provisions of this chapter, which drain the streets or other public thoroughfares and rights-of-way, in which a steam, electric or other railroad has been constructed, there shall be assessed against such railroad a fair and just proportion of the cost of the construction of such sewer, to be determined by the governing authorities of such municipality, and such assessment shall be a lien upon the said railroad.
