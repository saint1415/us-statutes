The municipal judge may hold court outside the boundaries of the municipality but not more than within a one-mile radius of the municipality for any purpose; however, a municipal judge may hold court outside the boundaries of the municipality more than within a one-mile radius of the municipality when accepting a plea of a defendant at an adult detention center within the county. The municipal judge shall have the jurisdiction to hear and determine, without a jury and without a record of the testimony, all cases charging violations of the municipal ordinances and state misdemeanor laws made offenses against the municipality and to punish offenders therefor as may be prescribed by law. Except as otherwise provided by law, criminal proceedings shall be brought by sworn complaint filed in the municipal court. Such complaint shall state the essential elements of the offense charged and the statute or ordinance relied upon. Such complaint shall not be required to conclude with a general averment that the offense is against the peace and dignity of the state or in violation of the ordinances of the municipality. He may sit as a committing court in all felonies committed within the municipality, and he shall have the power to bind over the accused to the grand jury or to appear before the proper court having jurisdiction to try the same, and to set the amount of bail or refuse bail and commit the accused to jail in cases not bailable. The municipal judge is a conservator of the peace within his municipality. He may conduct preliminary hearings in all violations of the criminal laws of this state occurring within the municipality, and any person arrested for a violation of law within the municipality may be brought before him for initial appearance. The municipal court shall have jurisdiction of any case remanded to it by a circuit court grand jury. The municipal court shall have civil jurisdiction over actions filed pursuant to and as provided in Title 93, Chapter 21, Mississippi Code of 1972, the Protection from Domestic Abuse Act.(2)In the discretion of the court, where the objects of justice would be more likely met, as an alternative to imposition or payment of fine and/or incarceration, the municipal judge shall have the power to sentence convicted offenders to work on a public service project where the court has established such a program of public service by written guidelines filed with the clerk for public record. Such programs shall provide for reasonable supervision of the offender and the work shall be commensurate with the fine and/or incarceration that would have ordinarily been imposed. Such program of public service may be utilized in the implementation of the provisions of Section99-19-20, and public service work thereunder may be supervised by persons other than the sheriff.(3)The municipal judge may solemnize marriages, take oaths, affidavits and acknowledgments, and issue orders, subpoenas, summonses, citations, warrants for search and arrest upon a finding of probable cause, and other such process under seal of the court to any county or municipality, in a criminal case, to be executed by the lawful authority of the county or the municipality of the respondent, and enforce obedience thereto. The absence of a seal shall not invalidate the process.(4)When a person shall be charged with an offense in municipal court punishable by confinement, the municipal judge, being satisfied that such person is an indigent person and is unable to employ counsel, may, in the discretion of the court, appoint counsel from the membership of The Mississippi Bar residing in his county who shall represent him. Compensation for appointed counsel in criminal cases shall be approved and allowed by the municipal judge and shall be paid by the municipality. The maximum compensation shall not exceed Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) for any one (1) case. The governing authorities of a municipality may, in their discretion, appoint a public defender(s) who must be a licensed attorney and who shall receive a salary to be fixed by the governing authorities.(5)The municipal judge of any municipality is hereby authorized to suspend the sentence and to suspend the execution of the sentence, or any part thereof, on such terms as may be imposed by the municipal judge. However, the suspension of imposition or execution of a sentence hereunder may not be revoked after a period of two (2) years. The municipal judge shall have the power to establish and operate a probation program, dispute resolution program and other practices or procedures appropriate to the judiciary and designed to aid in the administration of justice. Any such program shall be established by the court with written policies and procedures filed with the clerk of the court for public record. Subsequent to original sentencing, the municipal judge, in misdemeanor cases, is hereby authorized to suspend sentence and to suspend the execution of a sentence, or any part thereof, on such terms as may be imposed by the municipal judge, if (a) the judge or his or her predecessor was authorized to order such suspension when the sentence was originally imposed; and (b) such conviction (i) has not been appealed; or (ii) has been appealed and the appeal has been voluntarily dismissed.(6)Upon prior notice to the municipal prosecuting attorney and upon a showing in open court of rehabilitation, good conduct for a period of two (2) years since the last conviction in any court and that the best interest of society would be served, the court may, in its discretion, order the record of conviction of a person of any or all misdemeanors in that court expunged, and upon so doing the said person thereafter legally stands as though he had never been convicted of the said misdemeanor(s) and may lawfully so respond to any query of prior convictions. This order of expunction does not apply to the confidential records of law enforcement agencies and has no effect on the driving record of a person maintained under Title 63, Mississippi Code of 1972, or any other provision of said Title 63.(7)Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (6) of this section, a person who was convicted in municipal court of a misdemeanor before reaching his twenty-third birthday, excluding conviction for a traffic violation, and who is a first offender, may utilize the provisions of Section99-19-71, to expunge such misdemeanor conviction.(8)In the discretion of the court, a plea of nolo contendere may be entered to any charge in municipal court. Upon the entry of a plea of nolo contendere the court shall convict the defendant of the offense charged and shall proceed to sentence the defendant according to law.

      "text": "(1)(a)The purpose of bail is to guarantee appearance and a bail bond shall not be forfeited for any other reason.(b)(i)If a defendant in any criminal case, proceeding or matter fails to appear for any proceeding as ordered by the municipal court, then the court shall order the bail forfeited and a judgment nisi and a bench warrant issued at the time of nonappearance. The clerk of the municipal court shall notify the surety of the forfeiture by writ of scire facias, with a copy of the judgment nisi and bench warrant attached thereto, within ten (10) working days of such order of judgment nisi either by personal service or by certified mail. Failure of the clerk to provide the required notice within ten (10) working days shall constitute prima facie evidence that the order should be set aside.(ii)1.The judgment nisi shall be returnable for ninety (90) days from the date of issuance. If during that period the defendant appears before the municipal court, or is arrested and surrendered, then the judgment nisi shall be set aside. If the surety produces the defendant or provides to the municipal court reasonable mitigating circumstances upon such showing, then the forfeiture shall not be made final. If the forfeiture is made final, a copy of the final judgment shall be served on the surety within ten (10) working days by either personal service or certified mail.2.Reasonable mitigating circumstances shall be that the defendant is incarcerated in another jurisdiction; that the defendant is hospitalized under a doctor's care; that the defendant is in a recognized drug rehabilitation program; that the defendant has been placed in a witness protection program, in which case it shall be the duty of any agency placing the defendant into a witness protection program to notify the municipal court and the municipal court to notify the surety; or any other reason justifiable to the municipal court.(2)If a final judgment is entered against a surety licensed by the Department of Insurance and has not been set aside after ninety (90) days, or later if such time is extended by the municipal court issuing the judgment nisi, then the municipal court shall order the department to revoke the authority of the surety to write bail bonds. The Commissioner of Insurance shall, upon notice of the municipal court, notify the surety within five (5) working days of receipt of the order of revocation. If after ten (10) working days of the notification the revocation order has not been set aside by the municipal court, then the commissioner shall revoke the authority of the surety and all agents of the surety and shall notify the sheriff of every county of such revocation.(3)If within eighteen (18) months of the date of the final forfeiture the defendant appears for municipal court, is arrested or surrendered to the municipal court, or if the defendant is found to be incarcerated in another jurisdiction and a hold order placed on the defendant, then the amount of bail, less reasonable extradition cost, excluding attorney fees, shall be refunded by the municipal court upon application by the surety.(4)(a)The municipal judge shall set the amount of bail for persons charged with offenses in municipal court and may approve the bond or recognizance therefor.(b)The court shall not set the financial conditions of bail solely for the purpose of detaining the defendant. When bail is set, it is presumed that the amount of bail is both necessary to reasonably assure the safety of a victim, witness or the general public and to guarantee the appearance of a defendant as required by the court. The amount of bail is also presumed to be attainable by the defendant. The presumption that bail is attainable by the defendant may be rebutted by the defendant who may file a motion to reduce or set aside the bail requirement with the court due to lack of financial means, which shall also consider the availability of a third-party support system to obtain the defendant's release. The court shall rule on any such motion within forty-eight (48) hours of the filing.(c)If the defendant or his counsel asserts that the defendant is indigent and cannot afford the amount of bail, the municipal judge shall make a determination of whether the defendant can be released on recognizance, based on the standards enumerated in the Mississippi Rules of Criminal Procedure and any other factors considered relevant by the municipal judge. No misdemeanor defendant shall be incarcerated solely because the defendant cannot afford to post bail; nor shall a misdemeanor defendant be released solely because the defendant cannot afford bail. It is the duty of the municipal judge to ensure that release of the defendant does not jeopardize the community.(d)The accused may waive an appearance before the judge and execute an appearance bond in an amount determined by the court from the bond guidelines set out in the Mississippi Rules of Criminal Procedure and agree to appear at a specified time and place.(e)If the municipal judge is unavailable and has not provided a bail schedule or otherwise provided for the setting of bail, it is lawful for any officer or officers designated by order of the municipal judge to take bond, cash, property or recognizance, with or without sureties, in the amount of the minimum bail specified in the bond guidelines set out in the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure, payable to the municipality and conditioned for the appearance of the person on the return day and time of the writ before the court to which the warrant is returnable, or in cases of arrest without a warrant, on the day and time set by the court or officer for arraignment, and there remain from day to day and term to term until discharged.(f)In circumstances involving an offense against any of the following:(i)a current or former spouse of the accused or child of that person;(ii)a person living as a spouse or who formerly lived as a spouse with the accused or a child of that person;(iii)a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild or someone similarly situated to the accused;(iv)a person who has a current or former dating relationship with the accused; or(v)a person with whom the accused has had a biological or legally adopted child, the municipal judge shall check, or cause to be made a check of the status of the person for whom recognizance or bond is taken before ordering bail in the Mississippi Protection Order Registry authorized under Section93-21-25, and the existence of a domestic abuse protection order against the accused shall be considered when determining appropriate bail.(g)All bonds shall be promptly returned to the court, together with any cash deposited, and be filed and proceeded on by the court in a case of forfeiture. The chief of the municipal police or a police officer or officers designated by order of the municipal judge may approve bonds or recognizances.(h)All bonds and recognizances in municipal court where the municipal court shall have the jurisdiction to hear and determine the case may be made payable to the municipality and shall have the effect to bind the principal and any sureties on the bond or recognizance until they shall be discharged by due course of law without renewal.Laws, 1979, ch. 401, § 5; Laws, 1988, ch. 564, § 2; Laws, 2001, ch. 547, § 2; Laws, 2010, ch. 466, § 4; Laws, 2011, ch. 463, § 3, eff. 7/1/2011.Amended by Laws, 2023, ch. 376, SB 2298,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2023.\n\n(1)(a)The purpose of bail is to guarantee appearance and a bail bond shall not be forfeited for any other reason.(b)(i)If a defendant in any criminal case, proceeding or matter fails to appear for any proceeding as ordered by the municipal court, then the court shall order the bail forfeited and a judgment nisi and a bench warrant issued at the time of nonappearance.
