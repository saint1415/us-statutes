This option shall be exercised through the enactment of an appropriate ordinance by the municipal governing body prior to the election to adopt the council-manager plan of government. In the event the council fails to exercise this option, the council shall consist of five (5) councilmen.(c)At the next regular municipal election which takes place after the adoption of the council-manager form of government, the mayor shall be elected at large by the voters of the entire city. Also, the councilmen shall be elected at large by the voters of the entire city to represent a city-wide district, or each of four (4) councilmen may be elected from a ward to represent such ward and one (1) councilman may be elected to represent a city-wide district. This option shall be exercised by an appropriate ordinance enacted by the city governing body prior to the election to adopt the council-manager plan of government. In the event the council fails to exercise this option, the councilmen shall be elected at large to represent the city-wide district. In its discretion at any time after adoption and implementation of the council-manager plan of government the council may provide for the election of councilmen by wards as provided herein, which shall become effective at the next regularly scheduled election for city councilmen.(d)Councilmen elected to represent wards must be residents of their wards; and in cities having more or fewer than five (5) councilmen, prior to September 30, 1962, the city governing body shall determine the number of councilmen to represent the wards and the number of councilmen to represent the city-wide district.(e)The council of any municipality having a population exceeding forty-five thousand (45,000) inhabitants according to the 1970 decennial census which is situated in a Class 1 county bordering on the State of Alabama and which is governed by a council-manager plan of government on January 1, 1977, may, in its discretion, adopt an ordinance to require the election of four (4) of the five (5) council members from wards and not from the city at large. The four (4) council members shall be elected one (1) each from the wards in which they reside in the municipality, and shall be elected only by the registered voters residing within the ward in which the council member resides. The mayor and fifth council member may continue to be elected from the city at large. Any council member who shall remove his residence from the ward from which he was elected shall, by operation of law, vacate his seat on the council.After publication of the population of the municipality according to the 1980 decennial census, the governing authorities of the municipality shall designate the geographical boundaries of new wards as provided in this subparagraph. Each ward shall contain as nearly as possible the population factor obtained by dividing by four (4) the city's population as shown by the 1980 and each most recent decennial census thereafter. It shall be the mandatory duty of the council to redistrict the city by ordinance, which ordinance may not be vetoed by the mayor, within six (6) months after the official publication by the United States of the population of the city as enumerated in each decennial census, and within six (6) months after the effective date of any expansion of municipal boundaries; provided, however, if the publication of the most recent decennial census or effective date of an expansion of the municipal boundaries occurs six (6) months or more prior to the first primary of a general municipal election, then the council shall redistrict the city by ordinance within at least sixty (60) days of such first primary. If the publication of the most recent decennial census occurs less than six (6) months prior to the first primary of a general municipal election, the election shall be held with regard to currently defined wards; and reapportioned wards based on the census shall not serve as the basis for representation until the next regularly scheduled election in which council members shall be elected. If annexation of additional territory into the municipal corporate limits of the city shall occur less than six (6) months prior to the first primary of a general municipal election, the city council shall, by ordinance adopted within three (3) days of the effective date of such annexation, assign such annexed territory to an adjacent ward or wards so as to maintain as nearly as possible substantial equality of population between wards. Any subsequent redistricting of the city by ordinance as required by this section shall not serve as the basis for representation until the next regularly scheduled election for city councilmen.(2)However, in any municipality situated in a Class 1 county bordering on the Mississippi Sound and the State of Alabama, traversed by U.S. Highway 90, the legislative power of such municipality in which the council-manager plan of government is in effect shall be vested in a council consisting of a mayor and six (6) councilmen. In the next regular municipal election in such municipality, the mayor shall be elected at large by the voters of the entire municipality. Also, the councilmen shall be elected at large by the voters of the entire municipality to represent a municipality-wide district, or each of five (5) councilmen may be elected from one (1) of five (5) wards to represent said ward and one (1) councilman shall be elected to represent a municipality-wide district. This option as to wards shall be exercised by an appropriate ordinance enacted by the municipal governing body. In the event the council fails to exercise this option, the councilmen shall be elected at large to represent the municipality-wide district. Councilmen elected to represent wards must be residents of their wards.The method of electing the mayor and councilmen shall be the same as otherwise provided by law except as provided in this chapter. The mayor and councilmen elected hereunder shall hold office for a term of four (4) years and until their successors are elected and qualified. No person shall be eligible to the office of mayor or councilman unless he is a qualified elector of such city.(3)(a)In the event a city with a population of one hundred thousand (100,000) or more inhabitants according to the last decennial census adopts the council-manager form of government, the legislative power of said city shall be vested in a council consisting of a mayor and eight (8) councilmen.(b)At the next regular municipal election which takes place after the adoption of the council-manager form of government, the mayor shall be elected at large by the voters of the entire municipality. The municipality shall be divided into five (5) wards with one (1) councilman to be elected from each ward by the voters of that ward, and three (3) councilmen to be elected from the municipality at large. Councilmen elected to represent wards must be residents of their wards at the time of qualification for election, and any councilman who removes his residence from the city or from the ward from which he was elected shall vacate his office.(c)It shall be the duty of the municipal governing body existing at the time of the adoption of the council-manager form of government to designate the geographical boundaries of the five (5) wards within sixty (60) days after the election in which the council-manager form is selected.

The mayor and councilmen elected hereunder shall hold office for a term of four (4) years and until their successors are elected and qualified.
