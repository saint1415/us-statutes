Council members elected to represent wards must be residents of their wards for two (2) years as provided in Section23-15-300at the time of qualification for election, and any council member who removes the member's residence from the municipality or from the ward from which elected shall vacate that office. However, any candidate for council member who is properly qualified as a candidate under applicable law shall be deemed to be qualified as a candidate in whatever ward the member resides if the ward has changed after the council has redistricted the municipality as provided in paragraph (c)(ii) of this subsection (4), and if the wards have been so changed, any person may qualify as a candidate for council member, by changing the person's residence, not less than fifteen (15) days before the first party primary or special party primary, as the case may be, notwithstanding any other residency or qualification requirements to the contrary.(b)The council or board existing at the time of the adoption of the mayor-council form of government shall designate the geographical boundaries of the wards within one hundred twenty (120) days after the election in which the mayor-council form of government is selected. In designating the geographical boundaries of the wards, each ward shall contain, as nearly as possible, the population factor obtained by dividing the municipality's population as shown by the most recent decennial census by the number of wards into which the municipality is to be divided.(c)(i)It shall be the mandatory duty of the council to redistrict the municipality by ordinance, which ordinance may not be vetoed by the mayor, within six (6) months after the official publication by the United States of the population of the municipality as enumerated in each decennial census, and within six (6) months after the effective date of any expansion of municipal boundaries; however, if the publication of the most recent decennial census or effective date of an expansion of the municipal boundaries occurs six (6) months or more before the first party primary of a general municipal election, then the council shall redistrict the municipality by ordinance not less than sixty (60) days before the first party primary.(ii)If the publication of the most recent decennial census occurs less than six (6) months before the first primary of a general municipal election, the election shall be held with regard to the existing defined wards; reapportioned wards based on the census shall not serve as the basis for representation until the next regularly scheduled election in which council members shall be elected.(d)If annexation of additional territory into the municipal corporate limits of the municipality occurs less than six (6) months before the first party primary of a general municipal election, the council shall, by ordinance adopted within three (3) days of the effective date of the annexation, assign the annexed territory to an adjacent ward or wards so as to maintain as nearly as possible substantial equality of population between wards; any subsequent redistricting of the municipality by ordinance as required by this chapter shall not serve as the basis for representation until the next regularly scheduled election for municipal council members.(5)Vacancies occurring in the council shall be filled as provided in Section23-15-857.(6)The mayor shall maintain an office at the city hall. The council members shall not maintain individual offices at the city hall; however, in a municipality having a population of one hundred thousand (100,000) and above according to the latest federal decennial census, council members may have individual offices in the city hall. Clerical work of council members in the performance of the duties of their office shall be performed by municipal employees or at municipal expense, and council members shall be reimbursed for the reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of the duties of their office.Laws, 1973, ch. 328, § 4; Laws, 1974, ch. 336 § 1; Laws, 1976, ch. 355, § 4; Laws, 1977, ch. 310; Laws, 1980, ch. 373; Laws, 1987, ch. 509, § 1; Laws, 1990, ch. 304, § 1; Laws, 1994, ch. 358, § 1; Laws, 2001, ch. 302, § 1; Laws, 2010, ch. 319, § 2; Laws, 2011, ch. 496, § 1, eff. 4/6/2011.Amended by Laws, 2022, ch. 341, HB 1341,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2022.Brought forward without change by Laws, 2019, ch. 340, HB 914,§ 5, eff. 7/1/2019.\n\nLaws, 1973, ch. 328, § 4; Laws, 1974, ch. 336 § 1; Laws, 1976, ch. 355, § 4; Laws, 1977, ch. 310; Laws, 1980, ch. 373; Laws, 1987, ch. 509, § 1; Laws, 1990, ch. 304, § 1; Laws, 1994, ch. 358, § 1; Laws, 2001, ch. 302, § 1; Laws, 2010, ch. 319, § 2; Laws, 2011, ch. 496, § 1, eff. 4/6/2011.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2022, ch. 341, HB 1341,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2022.\n\nBrought forward without change by Laws, 2019, ch. 340, HB 914,§ 5, eff. 7/1/2019.",
