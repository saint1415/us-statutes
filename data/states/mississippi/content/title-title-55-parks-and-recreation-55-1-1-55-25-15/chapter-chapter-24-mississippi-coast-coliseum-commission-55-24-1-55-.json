Multipurpose coliseum and related facilities shall include a multipurpose coliseum or arena facility, a convention center and facility grounds, as well as any lands purchased by or on the behalf of the commission. From and after July 1, 2016, any development and/or any land acquired by or on behalf of the commission, shall be subject to the Land Development Ordinances of the City of Biloxi. Such commission is authorized to acquire lands by purchase, gift or the exercise of eminent domain as provided by Section11-27-1et seq., above or below mean high-water mark subject to the approval of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. The acquisition of lands below mean high-water mark by the commission for the purposes authorized herein are declared to be in all respects for the benefit of the people of the State of Mississippi, a public purpose, and an essential governmental function in the exercise of the powers conferred upon them by such act.The commission, acting on behalf of the State of Mississippi, shall have the right to reclaim submerged lands for the purpose of constructing a multipurpose coliseum and related facilities, and to acquire in its name on behalf of the state any estate or property right therein or in other land necessary to the purpose of this chapter by purchase, gift, deed or other transfer, subject to the approval of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. Title to all oil, gas and other minerals in, on or under any lands, title to which is held by the State of Mississippi on August 8, 1968, shall be reserved unto the State of Mississippi, and all income derived from the sale or lease of such minerals shall inure to the benefit of the State of Mississippi for such purposes as the Legislature may direct. Provided, that prior to utilization of lands in which title vests in the State of Mississippi, a description of such land shall be submitted to the Department of Finance and Administration and said utilization shall not be commenced until or unless approval of such utilization is given by the Department of Finance and Administration.The commission is authorized to own, furnish, equip and operate the multipurpose coliseum and facilities and equipment necessary or useful in the operation of such multipurpose coliseum and related facilities; to receive and expend, subject to the provisions of this chapter and the approval of the commission's annual budget by the Harrison County Board of Supervisors, revenues from any source, including the operation of the multipurpose coliseum and related facilities; and to do all other things necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.The commission is authorized and directed to adopt uniform rules and regulations regarding the granting of contracts that are less than one hundred eighty (180) days for franchises, licenses, contracts or lease agreements, or the granting of contracts that are less than one hundred eighty (180) days for the use, operation and maintenance of the premises, and to publish the uniform rules and regulations for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county and fixing a time and place not more than ten (10) days after the last publication to receive and hear objections to such rules and regulations. The commission shall also publish such information on commission and county websites during the same time period as the newspaper publication. In addition, a copy of such rules and regulations or any revisions or amendments thereto shall be filed with the Clerk of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. The commission may revise or amend such rules and regulations but such revisions shall be uniform and shall not be adopted unless the commission shall publish the proposed change and hold a public hearing as required by this section.Before any contract that is more than one hundred eighty (180) days for a franchise, license, contract or lease agreement may be granted, the commission shall notify the Harrison County Board of Supervisors and publish its intent to grant such franchise, license, contract or lease agreement and the conditions upon which same shall be granted. Such publication shall be made for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in Harrison County. Such publication shall also be made on the commission and county websites during the same time period as the newspaper publication. All bids received shall be sealed, and shall be opened at a date, time and place set forth in the publications, which date shall not be less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days after the last day of such publications.Unless the commission shall find that the successful bidder cannot demonstrate financial responsibility to comply with the terms and conditions of the franchise, license, contract or lease agreement or cannot perform the services required thereunder, it shall, subject to the limitations set forth under this chapter, recommend the granting of the franchise, license, contract or lease agreement to the bidder whose proposal shall be in the best financial interest of the commission.Any person aggrieved by any action of the commission may appeal to the Circuit Court of Harrison County in the manner provided for appeals from orders of the board of supervisors.The commission is granted the power to sue and be sued in its own name, and the commission is authorized to take liability insurance on the operation of the facilities in an amount equal to the extent of its liability for claims or causes of action arising from acts or omissions as provided in Section11-46-15; provided, however, that immunity from suit is only waived to the extent of such liability insurance carried, and a judgment creditor shall have recourse only to the proceeds or right to proceeds of such liability insurance. No attempt shall be made in the trial of any case to suggest the existence of any insurance which covers in whole or in part any judgment or award rendered in favor of a claimant, but if the verdict rendered by the jury exceeds the limit of applicable insurance, the court on motion shall reduce the amount of said judgment to a sum equal to the applicable limit stated in the insurance policy.The commission shall prepare an annual budget specifically describing the proposed receipt and expenditure of all funds from any source whatsoever, and such budget shall be approved by the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. If the commission desires to take any action associated with the receipt or expenditure of funds which deviates from the annual budget, such individual action shall be subject to the approval of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors.The commission is granted the power to invest funds credited to the Mississippi Coast Coliseum Commission Operating Fund, the commission is vested with authority to designate depositories of its funds, and to deposit the funds in interest-bearing accounts. Provided, however, all funds in excess of ninety (90) days' operating expenses, to the extent practicable, shall be invested in Treasury bills or in interest-bearing accounts or approved securities to include, but not limited to, U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, federal agency securities or mortgage-backed securities guaranteed as to repayment of principal by the government or an agency of such government, certificates of deposit fully covered by insurance administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or covered by pledged securities, repurchase agreements and short-term money market funds invested in United States government and United States government agencies.The commission is authorized to contract with any agency of the United States or the State of Mississippi for a loan or grant, subject to the approval of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors and to give such agency any assurances of compliance with federal or state laws which are not in conflict with the laws of the State of Mississippi. It is the intent and purpose of this chapter that the Coliseum Commission cooperate with agencies administering the National Seashore Act of 1970.Whenever any real or personal property belonging to the commission shall cease to be used or needed for the commission's purposes, the commission may recommend to the Harrison County Board of Supervisors that it sell, exchange or lease the property on such terms as the commission may propose. No lease of surplus real property may exceed a term of ninety-nine (99) years. The deed of conveyance in such transactions shall be executed in the name of the commission by the Harrison County Board of Supervisors pursuant to order issued on the minutes of its meetings. In any sale, exchange or lease of real property, the commission shall retain all mineral rights that it owns, together with the right of ingress and egress to remove same. Before any sale, exchange or lease is made, the commissioners shall publish at least once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks, in a public newspaper of Harrison County, Mississippi, and on the commission and county websites the intention to sell, exchange or lease, as the case may be, the real or personal property and to accept sealed competitive bids for the sale, exchange or lease. The commissioners shall thereafter accept bids for the sale, exchange or lease, and the property shall be sold, exchanged or leased to the highest and best bidder in the manner provided by law. However, whenever the commissioners shall find and determine, by resolution duly and lawfully adopted and spread upon its minutes:(a)that any commission-owned real property is no longer needed for commission purposes and is not to be used in the operation of a multipurpose coliseum and related facilities,(b)that the sale, exchange or lease of such property in the manner otherwise provided for herein is necessary or desirable for the financial welfare of a multipurpose coliseum and related facilities, and(c)that the use of such property for the purpose for which it is to be sold, exchanged or leased will promote and foster the development and improvement of the multipurpose coliseum and related facilities, the commissioners may recommend to the Harrison County Board of Supervisors that it sell, exchange or lease the property without having to advertise for and accept competitive bids. In any case in which the commission proposes to sell or exchange real property under the provisions of this section without advertising for and accepting competitive bids, the Harrison County Board of Supervisors must approve such proposal, and consideration for the sale or exchange of the real property shall be not less than the average of the fair market price for the property as determined by three (3) professional property appraisers selected by the commission and approved by the purchaser or devisee and the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. Appraisal fees shall be shared equally by the commission and the purchaser or devisee.The enumeration of any specific rights and powers contained herein or elsewhere in this chapter where followed by general powers shall not be construed in the restrictive sense but rather in as broad and comprehensive sense as possible to effectuate the purposes and intent of this chapter.Laws, 1968, ch. 530, § 5; Laws, 1972, ch. 435, § 1; Laws, 1975, ch. 445, § 1; Laws, 1977, ch. 456, § 1; Laws, 1979, ch. 467, § 1; Laws, 1990, ch. 899, § 1; Laws, 1991, ch. 825, § 1; Laws, 2005, ch. 482, § 1; Laws, 2008, ch. 310, § 1, eff. 3/17/2008.Amended by Laws, 2016, ch. 489, HB 1203, 3, eff. 7/1/2016.\n\nThe Mississippi Coast Coliseum Commission, a political subdivision of the State of Mississippi, shall have jurisdiction and authority over matters relating to promoting, developing, maintaining and operating a multipurpose coliseum and related facilities within Harrison County, Mississippi.
