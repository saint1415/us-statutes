Unless the judge has made some other finding regarding property at the premises, the tenant may remove its property during this time. If the tenant has vacated the premises by the court-ordered move-out date, then the landlord may dispose of any property, not addressed by the court, which the tenant leaves behind without further notice to the tenant.(3)After the court-ordered move-out date, the landlord may request a warrant for removal. Upon such request and the payment of applicable fees, the judge shall, except as otherwise prohibited under subsection (5) of this section, immediately issue a warrant to the sheriff or any constable of the county in which the premises, or some part thereof, are situated, immediately commanding the sheriff or constable to remove all persons from the premises, and to put the landlord into full possession thereof.(4)Unless the judge has made some other finding regarding property at the premises, the landlord shall allow the tenant reasonable access to the premises for seventy-two (72) hours after the warrant for removal has been executed to enable the tenant to remove the tenant's property, including any manufactured home. All property the tenant leaves on the premises seventy-two (72) hours after the execution of the warrant for removal shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed of by the landlord without further notice or obligation to the tenant.(5)In cases in which the possession judgment is based solely on the tenant's nonpayment of rent, the judge shall not issue a warrant for removal, on or before the court-ordered move-out date, if the tenant has paid in full all unpaid rent and other sums owed pursuant to the judgment.

Unless the judge has made some other finding regarding property at the premises, the tenant may remove its property during this time. If the tenant has vacated the premises by the court-ordered move-out date, then the landlord may dispose of any property, not addressed by the court, which the tenant leaves behind without further notice to the tenant.(3)After the court-ordered move-out date, the landlord may request a warrant for removal.
