The division may also make any such payment contingent upon the provider limiting its right to collect from the victim, the claimant, or the division; or contingent upon the provider entering into a covenant not to sue the victim, the claimant or the division.(8)An award shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or other process, except that an award shall not be exempt from orders for the withholding of support for minor children in accordance with Section93-11-71, and except that an award for allowable expense shall not be exempt from a claim of a creditor to the extent that such creditor has provided products, services or accommodations, the costs of which are included in the award.(9)An assignment by the claimant to any future award under the provisions of this chapter is unenforceable, except:(a)An assignment of any award for work loss to assure payment of court-ordered alimony, maintenance or child support; or(b)An assignment for any award for allowable expense to the extent that the benefits are for the cost of products, services or accommodations necessitated by the injury or death on which the claim is based and which are provided or are to be provided by the assignee.(10)Subsections (8) and (9) of this section prevail over Sections75-9-406and75-9-408of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code to the extent, if any, that Sections75-9-406and75-9-408may otherwise be applicable.Laws, 1990, ch. 509, § 12; Laws, 1996, ch. 506, § 10; Laws, 1998, ch. 484, § 3; Laws, 2000, ch. 577, § 4; Laws, 2001, ch. 495, § 32; Laws, 2002, ch. 352, § 2; Laws, 2007, ch. 587, § 6; Laws, 2012, ch. 503, § 5, eff. 7/1/2012.\n\nLaws, 1990, ch. 509, § 12; Laws, 1996, ch. 506, § 10; Laws, 1998, ch. 484, § 3; Laws, 2000, ch. 577, § 4; Laws, 2001, ch. 495, § 32; Laws, 2002, ch. 352, § 2; Laws, 2007, ch. 587, § 6; Laws, 2012, ch. 503, § 5, eff. 7/1/2012.",
