The document granting such an application shall be known as a certificate of appropriateness. No commission may deny a certificate of appropriateness for demolition if denial of such a certificate would cause unreasonable economic hardship to an owner.(e)The commission shall use as a basis for its decisions on applications for certificates of appropriateness the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings as well as any more specific design review guidelines adopted by the commission or the governing authority of the county or municipality or combination thereof.(f)The commission, at the discretion of the governing authority, may grant or deny the certificates of appropriateness in whole or in part and may grant certificates of appropriateness contingent upon the acceptance by the applicant of specified conditions.(g)The commission shall not consider interior arrangements of buildings and structures except that it may when requested by the Department of Archives and History to advise the department on questions relating to the interiors of publicly owned historic buildings. Interior arrangements not to be considered by the commission shall include floor plans, architectural details and finishes, but the commission may consider interior structural elements visible through doors or windows if they become deteriorated because of demolition by neglect. Such interior structural elements may include walls, floors and ceilings, as well as other supporting elements of a composite structure.(h)The commission may, by local ordinance, review proposed governmental actions affecting governmentally owned structures included within local historic districts, located on landmark sites or designated as landmarks.(i)The commission, subject to the consent of and requirements of the county or municipality or combination thereof, may apply for, receive, hold and spend funds from private and public sources in addition to appropriations made by the county or municipality or combination thereof for the purpose of carrying out the duties of the commission.(j)The commission, subject to the consent of and the requirements of the county or municipality or combination thereof, may employ such staff or contract with technical experts or other persons as may be required for the performance of its duties and may obtain the equipment, supplies and other materials necessary for its effective operation.(k)The commission, solely in the performance of its official duties and only at reasonable times, may enter upon private land for the examination or survey thereof.
