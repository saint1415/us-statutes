Reclamation standards shall apply to all operations, exploration activities and reclamation operations covered by this chapter and shall require the operator at a minimum to:(a)Conduct operations in a manner consistent with prudent mining practice, so as to maximize the utilization and conservation of the resource being recovered; and, in keeping with the intent of maximizing the value of mined land, stockpiles of commercially valuable material may remain, if they are ecologically stable. Stockpiling shall be subject to rules and regulations adopted by the commission;(b)Restore the affected area so that it may be used for a useful, productive and beneficial purpose, including an agricultural, grazing, commercial, residential or recreational purpose, including lakes, ponds, wetlands, wildlife habitat, or other natural or forested areas;(c)Conduct water drainage and silt control for the affected area to strictly control soil erosion, damage to adjacent lands and pollution of waters of the state, both during and following the mining operations. Before, during and for a reasonable period after mining, all drainways for the affected area shall be protected with silt traps or dams of approved design as directed by the regulations. The operator may impound water to provide wetlands, lakes or ponds of approved design for wildlife, recreational or water supply purposes, if it is a part of the approved reclamation plan;(d)Remove or cover all metal, lumber and other refuse, except vegetation, resulting from the operation;(e)Regrade the area to the nearest approximate original contour or rolling topography, and eliminate all highwalls and spoil piles, except as provided in an approved reclamation plan. Lakes, ponds or wetlands may be constructed, if part of an approved reclamation plan;(f)Stabilize and protect all affected areas sufficiently to control erosion and attendant air and water pollution;(g)Remove the topsoil, if any, from the affected area in a separate layer, and place it on any authorized lieu lands to be reclaimed or replace it on the backfill area. If not utilized immediately, the topsoil shall be segregated in a separate pile from other spoil. If the topsoil is not replaced on a backfill area of authorized lieu lands within a time short enough to avoid deterioration, the topsoil shall be protected by a successful cover of plants or by other means approved by the Permit Board.

A method of reclamation other than that provided in this section may be approved by the Permit Board if the Permit Board determines that the method of reclamation required by this section is not practical and that the alternative method will provide for the affected area to be restored to a useful, productive and beneficial purpose. If an alternative method of reclamation is generally applicable to all operations involving a particular material, the commission may promulgate appropriate rules and regulations for use of the alternative method.(3)Each operator, except as authorized by the Permit Board, shall perform reclamation work concurrently with the conduct of the mining operation where practical. The fact that an operator will likely redisturb an area shall be cause for the Permit Board to grant an exception from the requirement of concurrent reclamation.(4)The operator and, in case of bond forfeiture, the department or its designee, shall have the continuing right to enter and inspect the affected area in the reclamation plan and to perform any reclamation measures required properly to complete the reclamation plan.(5)(a)If the commission finds that (i) reclamation of the affected area is not proceeding in accordance with the reclamation plan and that the operator has failed within thirty (30) days after notice to commence corrective action or (ii) revegetation has not been properly completed in conformance with the reclamation plan within two (2) years or longer, if required by the commission, after termination of mining operations or upon revocation of the permit, or if the Permit Board revokes a permit, the commission may initiate proceedings against the bond or deposit filed by the operator.

The funds from the forfeited performance bond or deposit shall be placed in the appropriate account in the fund and used to pay for reclamation of the permit area and remediation of any off-site damages resulting from the operation. Any surplus performance bond or deposit funds shall be refunded to the operator or corporate surety.(d)Forfeiture proceedings shall be before the commission and an order of the commission under this subsection is a final order.

The department shall also publish notice of the forfeiture proceeding in a manner as required in regulation by the commission. Any formal hearing on the bond forfeiture shall be set at least thirty (30) days after the last notice publication.(f)If the performance bond or deposit is insufficient to cover the costs of reclamation of the permit area in accordance with the approved reclamation plan or remediation of any off-site damages, the commission may initiate a civil action to recover the deficiency amount in the county in which the surface mining operation is located.(g)If the commission initiates a civil action under this section, the commission shall be entitled to any sums necessary to complete reclamation of the permit area in accordance with the approved reclamation plan and remediate any off-site damages resulting from that operation.(6)If a landowner, upon termination or expiration of a lease, refuses to allow the operator to enter onto the property designated as the affected area to conduct or complete reclamation in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, or if the landowner interferes with or authorizes a third party to disturb or interfere with reclamation in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, the landowner shall assume the permit and shall file a reclamation plan and post a performance bond as required under this chapter.Laws, 1977, ch. 476, § 11; Laws, 1979, ch. 477, § 47; Laws, 2002, ch. 492, § 15, eff. 7/1/2002.\n\n(1)Any permit issued under this chapter shall require operations to comply with all applicable reclamation standards of this chapter.
