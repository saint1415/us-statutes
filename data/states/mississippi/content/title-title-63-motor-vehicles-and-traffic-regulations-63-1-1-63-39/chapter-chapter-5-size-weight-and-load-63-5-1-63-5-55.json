Vehicles operating without a harvest permit shall be allowed a tolerance not to exceed five percent (5%) above their authorized gross vehicle weight, tandem or axle weight; except that the maximum gross vehicle weight of any such vehicle shall not exceed eighty thousand (80,000) pounds plus a tolerance thereon of not more than two percent (2%). Vehicles operating without a harvest permit loading at a point of origin having scales available for weighing the vehicle shall not be eligible for any tolerance over the gross weight limit of eighty thousand (80,000) pounds. Vehicles operating with a harvest permit shall be allowed a tolerance not to exceed ten percent (10%) above their authorized gross vehicle weight, tandem or axle weight, but the maximum gross vehicle weight of any such vehicle shall not exceed eighty-eight thousand (88,000) pounds. However, neither the increased weights in this subsection nor any tolerance shall be allowed on federal interstate highways or on other highways where a tolerance is specifically prohibited by the Transportation Commission, the county board of supervisors or the municipal governing authorities as provided for in Section63-5-27. The tolerance allowed by this subsection shall only apply to the operation of vehicles from the point of loading to the point of unloading for processing, and to the operation of vehicles hauling sand, gravel, woodchips, wood shavings, sawdust, fill dirt, and agricultural products, and products for recycling or materials for the construction or repair of highways. The range of such operation shall not exceed a radius of one hundred (100) miles except where the products are being transported for processing within this state.(4)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section63-5-27and/or Section63-5-29to the contrary, vehicles hauling prepackaged products, unloaded at a state port or to be loaded at a state port, which are containerized in such a manner as to make subdivision thereof impractical shall be allowed a gross weight of not to exceed forty thousand (40,000) pounds on any tandem, and a tolerance not to exceed ten percent (10%) above their authorized gross weight, tandem or axle weight; except that the maximum weight of any vehicle shall not exceed eighty thousand (80,000) pounds plus a tolerance thereon of not more than two percent (2%); however, neither the increased weights in this subsection nor any tolerance shall be allowed on federal interstate highways or on other highways where a tolerance is specifically prohibited by the Transportation Commission, the county board of supervisors or the municipal governing authorities as provided for in Section63-5-27.(5)[Repealed effective 7/1/2025](a)Vehicles for which a harvest permit has been issued pursuant to Section27-19-81(4)shall be allowed a gross vehicle weight tolerance of ten percent (10%), not to exceed eighty-eight thousand (88,000) pounds. However, the board of supervisors of any county and the governing authorities of any municipality may designate the roads, streets and highways under their respective jurisdiction on and along which vehicles for which a harvest permit has been issued may travel. This subsection shall not apply to the federal interstate system.(b)Any owner or operator who has been issued a harvest permit and who wishes to operate a vehicle on the roads, streets or highways under the jurisdiction of a county or municipality at a gross vehicle weight greater than the weight allowed by law or greater than the maximum weight established for such roads, streets or highways by the board of supervisors or municipal governing authorities, shall notify, in writing, the board of supervisors or the governing authorities, as the case may be, before operating such vehicle on the roads, streets or highways of such county or municipality. In his notice, the permit holder shall identify the routes over which he intends to operate vehicles for which the permit has been issued and the dates or time period during which he will be operating such vehicles. The board of supervisors or the governing authorities, as the case may be, shall have two (2) working days to respond in writing to the permit holder to notify the permit holder of the routes on and along which the permit holder may operate vehicles for which a harvest permit has been issued. Failure of the board of supervisors or the governing authorities timely to notify the permit holder and to designate the routes on and along which the permit holder may operate shall be considered as authorizing the permit holder to operate on any of the roads, streets or highways of the county or municipality in accordance with the authority granted to the permit holder by the harvest permit.(c)Any time a timber deed is filed with the chancery clerk, the grantee, at that time, may make a written request of the board of supervisors of the county or the governing authorities of the municipality, as the case may be, for the purpose of providing to the grantee, within three (3) working days of the filing of the request, a designated and approved route over the roads, streets or highways under the jurisdiction of the county or city, as the case may be, that the grantee may travel for the purpose of transporting harvested timber. Upon providing such route designation, the county or city, as the case may be, shall also provide to the grantee a map designating the approved route. An approved route designation provided to a grantee under the provisions of this paragraph shall be valid for a period of six (6) months from its date of issue. The permit authorized to be issued under paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not be required for any person who obtains a permit issued under this paragraph.(d)This subsection (5) shall stand repealed from and after July 1, 2025.(6)Nothing in this section or subsections (1) through (4) of Section63-5-27shall be construed to deny the operation of any vehicle or combination of vehicles that could be lawfully operated upon the interstate highway system of this state on January 4, 1975.(7)(a)Notwithstanding any provisions of Section63-5-27to the contrary, a vehicle that is operated by an engine fueled primarily by compressed or liquefied natural gas may exceed the gross vehicle weight limits by an amount, not to exceed a maximum of two thousand (2,000) pounds, that is equal to the difference between the weight of the vehicle attributable to the natural gas tank and fueling system carried by the vehicle and the weight of a comparable diesel tank and fueling system.(b)The weight exception provided in this subsection shall apply to all interstate highways per the exemption expressly permitted by23 USC Section 127.Codes, 1942, § 8271; Laws, 1938, ch. 200; Laws, 1946, ch. 307, § 4; Laws, 1948, ch. 328, § 6; Laws, 1954, ch. 335; Laws, 1958, ch. 501; Laws, 1960, ch. 409; Laws, 1963, 1st Ex Sess ch. 22; Laws, 1964, ch. 458, §§ 1, 2; Laws, 1964, 1st Ex Sess ch. 33; Laws, 1981, ch. 366, § 6; Laws, 1981, ch. 532, § 1; Laws, 1982, ch. 479, § 2; Laws, 1984, ch. 364; Laws, 1989, ch. 385, § 1; Laws, 1993, ch. 478, § 2; Laws, 1994, ch. 501, § 3; Laws, 1996, ch. 408, § 2; Laws, 1997, ch. 548, § 2; Laws, 1998, ch. 592, § 2; Laws, 2000, ch. 589, § 2; Laws, 2002, ch. 386, § 2; Laws, 2009, ch. 554, § 2, eff. 7/1/2009.Amended by Laws, 2022, ch. 305, HB 1485,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2023.Amended by Laws, 2021, ch. 478, SB 2825,§ 21, eff. 7/1/2023.Amended by Laws, 2020, ch. 378, SB 2467,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2020.Amended by Laws, 2018, ch. 425, SB 2418,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2018.Amended by Laws, 2016, ch. 343, SB 2532, 2, eff. 7/1/2016.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 485, SB 2451, 2, eff. 7/1/2013.\n\n(1)Subject to the limitations imposed on wheel and axle loads by Section63-5-27, and to the further limitations hereinafter specified, the total combined weight (vehicles plus load) on any group of axles of a vehicle or a combination of vehicles shall not exceed the value given in the following table (Table III) corresponding to the distance in feet between the extreme axles of the group, measured longitudinally to the nearest foot, on those highways or parts of highways designated by the Mississippi Transportation Commission as being capable of carrying the maximum load limits and, in addition thereto, such other highways or parts of highways found by the commission to be suitable to carry the maximum load limits from an engineering standpoint, and so designated as such by order of the commission entered upon its minutes and published once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a daily newspaper published in this state and having a general circulation therein.

Vehicles operating without a harvest permit shall be allowed a tolerance not to exceed five percent (5%) above their authorized gross vehicle weight, tandem or axle weight; except that the maximum gross vehicle weight of any such vehicle shall not exceed eighty thousand (80,000) pounds plus a tolerance thereon of not more than two percent (2%). Vehicles operating without a harvest permit loading at a point of origin having scales available for weighing the vehicle shall not be eligible for any tolerance over the gross weight limit of eighty thousand (80,000) pounds. Vehicles operating with a harvest permit shall be allowed a tolerance not to exceed ten percent (10%) above their authorized gross vehicle weight, tandem or axle weight, but the maximum gross vehicle weight of any such vehicle shall not exceed eighty-eight thousand (88,000) pounds. However, neither the increased weights in this subsection nor any tolerance shall be allowed on federal interstate highways or on other highways where a tolerance is specifically prohibited by the Transportation Commission, the county board of supervisors or the municipal governing authorities as provided for in Section63-5-27. The tolerance allowed by this subsection shall only apply to the operation of vehicles from the point of loading to the point of unloading for processing, and to the operation of vehicles hauling sand, gravel, woodchips, wood shavings, sawdust, fill dirt, and agricultural products, and products for recycling or materials for the construction or repair of highways. The range of such operation shall not exceed a radius of one hundred (100) miles except where the products are being transported for processing within this state.(4)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section63-5-27and/or Section63-5-29to the contrary, vehicles hauling prepackaged products, unloaded at a state port or to be loaded at a state port, which are containerized in such a manner as to make subdivision thereof impractical shall be allowed a gross weight of not to exceed forty thousand (40,000) pounds on any tandem, and a tolerance not to exceed ten percent (10%) above their authorized gross weight, tandem or axle weight; except that the maximum weight of any vehicle shall not exceed eighty thousand (80,000) pounds plus a tolerance thereon of not more than two percent (2%); however, neither the increased weights in this subsection nor any tolerance shall be allowed on federal interstate highways or on other highways where a tolerance is specifically prohibited by the Transportation Commission, the county board of supervisors or the municipal governing authorities as provided for in Section63-5-27.(5)[Repealed effective 7/1/2025](a)Vehicles for which a harvest permit has been issued pursuant to Section27-19-81(4)shall be allowed a gross vehicle weight tolerance of ten percent (10%), not to exceed eighty-eight thousand (88,000) pounds. However, the board of supervisors of any county and the governing authorities of any municipality may designate the roads, streets and highways under their respective jurisdiction on and along which vehicles for which a harvest permit has been issued may travel. This subsection shall not apply to the federal interstate system.(b)Any owner or operator who has been issued a harvest permit and who wishes to operate a vehicle on the roads, streets or highways under the jurisdiction of a county or municipality at a gross vehicle weight greater than the weight allowed by law or greater than the maximum weight established for such roads, streets or highways by the board of supervisors or municipal governing authorities, shall notify, in writing, the board of supervisors or the governing authorities, as the case may be, before operating such vehicle on the roads, streets or highways of such county or municipality. In his notice, the permit holder shall identify the routes over which he intends to operate vehicles for which the permit has been issued and the dates or time period during which he will be operating such vehicles. The board of supervisors or the governing authorities, as the case may be, shall have two (2) working days to respond in writing to the permit holder to notify the permit holder of the routes on and along which the permit holder may operate vehicles for which a harvest permit has been issued. Failure of the board of supervisors or the governing authorities timely to notify the permit holder and to designate the routes on and along which the permit holder may operate shall be considered as authorizing the permit holder to operate on any of the roads, streets or highways of the county or municipality in accordance with the authority granted to the permit holder by the harvest permit.(c)Any time a timber deed is filed with the chancery clerk, the grantee, at that time, may make a written request of the board of supervisors of the county or the governing authorities of the municipality, as the case may be, for the purpose of providing to the grantee, within three (3) working days of the filing of the request, a designated and approved route over the roads, streets or highways under the jurisdiction of the county or city, as the case may be, that the grantee may travel for the purpose of transporting harvested timber. Upon providing such route designation, the county or city, as the case may be, shall also provide to the grantee a map designating the approved route. An approved route designation provided to a grantee under the provisions of this paragraph shall be valid for a period of six (6) months from its date of issue. The permit authorized to be issued under paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not be required for any person who obtains a permit issued under this paragraph.(d)This subsection (5) shall stand repealed from and after July 1, 2025.(6)Nothing in this section or subsections (1) through (4) of Section63-5-27shall be construed to deny the operation of any vehicle or combination of vehicles that could be lawfully operated upon the interstate highway system of this state on January 4, 1975.(7)(a)Notwithstanding any provisions of Section63-5-27to the contrary, a vehicle that is operated by an engine fueled primarily by compressed or liquefied natural gas may exceed the gross vehicle weight limits by an amount, not to exceed a maximum of two thousand (2,000) pounds, that is equal to the difference between the weight of the vehicle attributable to the natural gas tank and fueling system carried by the vehicle and the weight of a comparable diesel tank and fueling system.(b)The weight exception provided in this subsection shall apply to all interstate highways per the exemption expressly permitted by23 USC Section 127.Codes, 1942, § 8271; Laws, 1938, ch. 200; Laws, 1946, ch. 307, § 4; Laws, 1948, ch. 328, § 6; Laws, 1954, ch. 335; Laws, 1958, ch. 501; Laws, 1960, ch. 409; Laws, 1963, 1st Ex Sess ch. 22; Laws, 1964, ch. 458, §§ 1, 2; Laws, 1964, 1st Ex Sess ch. 33; Laws, 1981, ch. 366, § 6; Laws, 1981, ch. 532, § 1; Laws, 1982, ch. 479, § 2; Laws, 1984, ch. 364; Laws, 1989, ch. 385, § 1; Laws, 1993, ch. 478, § 2; Laws, 1994, ch. 501, § 3; Laws, 1996, ch. 408, § 2; Laws, 1997, ch. 548, § 2; Laws, 1998, ch. 592, § 2; Laws, 2000, ch. 589, § 2; Laws, 2002, ch. 386, § 2; Laws, 2009, ch. 554, § 2, eff. 7/1/2009.Amended by Laws, 2022, ch. 305, HB 1485,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2023.Amended by Laws, 2021, ch. 478, SB 2825,§ 21, eff. 7/1/2023.Amended by Laws, 2020, ch. 378, SB 2467,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2020.Amended by Laws, 2018, ch. 425, SB 2418,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2018.Amended by Laws, 2016, ch. 343, SB 2532, 2, eff. 7/1/2016.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 485, SB 2451, 2, eff. 7/1/2013.\n\n(1)Subject to the limitations imposed on wheel and axle loads by Section63-5-27, and to the further limitations hereinafter specified, the total combined weight (vehicles plus load) on any group of axles of a vehicle or a combination of vehicles shall not exceed the value given in the following table (Table III) corresponding to the distance in feet between the extreme axles of the group, measured longitudinally to the nearest foot, on those highways or parts of highways designated by the Mississippi Transportation Commission as being capable of carrying the maximum load limits and, in addition thereto, such other highways or parts of highways found by the commission to be suitable to carry the maximum load limits from an engineering standpoint, and so designated as such by order of the commission entered upon its minutes and published once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a daily newspaper published in this state and having a general circulation therein. The maximum total combined weight carried on any group of two (2) or more consecutive axles shall be determined by the formula contained in the Federal Weight Law enacted January 4, 1975, as follows: W=500 (LN/N-1+12N+36) where W=maximum weight in pounds carried on any group of two (2) or more axles computed to the nearest five hundred (500) pounds, L=distance in feet between the extremes of any group of two (2) or more consecutive axles, and N=number of axles in any group under consideration.TABLE IIIDISTANCE IN FEET BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF ANY GROUP OF 2 OR MORE CONSECUTIVE AXLESMAXIMUM LOAD IN POUNDS CARRIED ON ANY GROUP OF 2 OR MORE CONSECUTIVE AXLES2 axles3 axles4 axles5 axles6 axles7 axles434,000534,000634,000Axle groups in734,0008and less 34,00034,000these spacingsMore than838,00042,000939,00042,5001040,00043,500impractical1144,0001245,00050,0001345,50050,5001446,50051,5001547,00052,0001648,00052,50058,0001748,50053,50058,5001849,50054,00059,0001950,00054,50060,0002051,00055,50060,50066,0002151,50056,00061,00066,5002252,50056,50061,50067,0002353,00057,50062,50068,0002454,00058,00063,00068,50074,0002554,50058,50063,50069,00074,5002655,50059,50064,00069,50075,0002756,00060,00065,00070,00075,5002857,00060,50065,50071,00076,5002957,50061,50066,00071,50077,0003058,50062,00066,50072,00077,5003159,00062,50067,50072,50078,0003260,00063,50068,00073,00078,5003364,00068,50074,00079,0003464,50069,00074,50080,0003565,50070,00075,00080,0003666,00070,50075,50080,0003766,50071,00076,00080,0003867,50071,50077,00080,0003968,00072,50077,50080,0004068,50073,00078,00080,0004169,50073,50078,50080,0004270,00074,00079,00080,0004370,50075,00080,00080,0004471,50075,50080,00080,0004572,00076,00080,00080,0004672,50076,50080,00080,0004773,50077,50080,00080,0004874,00078,00080,00080,0004974,50078,50080,00080,0005075,50079,00080,00080,0005176,00080,00080,00080,0005276,50080,00080,00080,0005377,50080,00080,00080,0005478,00080,00080,00080,0005578,50080,00080,00080,0005679,50080,00080,00080,0005780,00080,00080,00080,000(2)Moreover, in addition to the per axle weight limitations specified by Section63-5-27, two (2) consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of thirty-four thousand (34,000) pounds each, providing that the overall distance between the first and last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles is thirty-six (36) feet or more, except that, until September 1, 1989, the axle distance for tank trailers, dump trailers and ocean transport container haulers may be thirty (30) feet or more.
