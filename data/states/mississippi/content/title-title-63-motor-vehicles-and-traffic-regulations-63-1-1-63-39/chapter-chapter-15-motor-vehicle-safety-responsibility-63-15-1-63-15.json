However, no driver shall be stopped or detained solely for the purpose of verifying that the motor vehicle is covered by liability insurance in the amounts required under Section63-15-3(j)unless the stop is part of such roadblock. If the law enforcement officer uses the verification system created in Section63-16-3and receives a response from the system verifying that the owner of the motor vehicle has liability insurance in the amounts required under Section63-15-3(j), then the officer shall not issue a citation under this section notwithstanding any failure to display an insurance card by the owner or operator.(4)Failure of the owner or the operator of a motor vehicle to have the insurance card in the motor vehicle, or to display the insurance card by electronic image on a cellular phone or other type of electronic device, is a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, is punishable by a fine of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) and suspension of driving privilege for a period of one (1) year or until the owner of the motor vehicle shows proof of liability insurance that is in compliance with the liability limits required by Section63-15-3(j)and has paid the fines and assessments imposed and the driver's license reinstatement fees imposed by the Department of Public Safety. A judge shall determine whether the defendant is indigent, and if a determination of indigence is made, shall authorize the reinstatement of that person's driver's license upon proof of mandatory liability insurance subject to compliance with a payment plan for any fines, assessments and/or fees. Fraudulent use of an insurance card shall be punishable in accordance with Section97-7-10. If such fines are levied in a municipal court, the funds from such fines shall be deposited in the general fund of the municipality. If such fines are levied in any of the courts of the county, the funds from such fines shall be deposited in the general fund of the county. A person convicted of a criminal offense under this subsection (4) shall not be convicted of a criminal offense under Section63-16-13(1)arising from the same incident.(5)If, at the hearing date or the date of payment of the fine the owner shows proof that such insurance was in effect at the time of citation, the case shall be dismissed as to the defendant with prejudice and all court costs shall be waived against the defendant.(6)No law enforcement officer may access any function, feature or other electronic image on a person's cellular phone or other type of electronic device when enforcing the provisions of this section except for the electronic image of an insurance card shown to the officer.Laws, 2000, ch. 302, § 1; Laws, 2005, ch. 483, § 5; Laws, 2005, ch. 498, § 1; Laws, 2008, ch. 487, § 1; Laws, 2012, ch. 504, § 8, eff. 7/1/2012.Amended by Laws, 2018, ch. 454, HB 325,§ 1, eff. 4/13/2018.Brought forward by Laws, 2017, ch. 303, SB 2479, 8, eff. 7/1/2017.Amended by Laws, 2015, ch. 421, SB 2380, 1, eff. 7/1/2015.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 475, SB 2593, 1, eff. 7/1/2013.\n\nLaws, 2000, ch. 302, § 1; Laws, 2005, ch. 483, § 5; Laws, 2005, ch. 498, § 1; Laws, 2008, ch. 487, § 1; Laws, 2012, ch. 504, § 8, eff. 7/1/2012.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2018, ch. 454, HB 325,§ 1, eff. 4/13/2018.\n\nBrought forward by Laws, 2017, ch. 303, SB 2479, 8, eff. 7/1/2017.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2015, ch. 421, SB 2380, 1, eff. 7/1/2015.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2013, ch. 475, SB 2593, 1, eff. 7/1/2013.",
