For the 1989 calendar year a total of Thirty-five Million Dollars ($35,000,000.00), less the aggregate of all carry-forward allocations to student loan projects from the state's ceiling for 1987 and 1988 (other than any carry-forward of all or part of the Thirteen Million Dollars ($13,000,000.00) allocation for 1987 described above), is hereby allocated from the undesignated portion to the student loan portion. Additional amounts may be allocated to the student loan portion pursuant to the provisions of Section31-23-61, and such notices of allocation shall remain valid from the date of issuance until the last business day of that year, notwithstanding the provisions of Section31-23-61(e). The student loan portion shall also include any other allocations to student loan projects pursuant to this act.(2)Upon written request of the board, the issuer of student loan bonds shall promptly provide a written certification to the board as to the amount available in the student loan allocation which the issuer reasonably expects to utilize. Any amount of the student loan allocation which the issuer does not certify that it reasonably expects to utilize, and which another issuer may utilize in accordance with the federal legislation, may be transferred from time to time by the board, in whole or in part, to the threshold portion or the undesignated portion. If such a transfer is made, an amount equal to that transferred shall be allocated from the undesignated portion of the state's ceiling to the student loan portion in the succeeding calendar year in addition to the amounts allocated to the student loan portion for that year as set forth above.(3)Student loan bonds may be issued at any time to the full extent of the amount available in the student loan portion, but not in excess of such amount. Confirmation of issuance of student loan bonds shall be furnished to the board by the issuer within thirty (30) business days after the issuance, but in any event on or before the last business day of the year in which such bonds were issued.(4)If there is any unused amount remaining in the student loan allocation on the last business day of a year, and if the issuer of student loan bonds has filed with the board one or more elections to treat one or more student loan projects as carry-forward projects, and has in the election specified the carry-forward amount or amounts, and identified the purpose for which the carry-forward is elected, the board shall allocate such unused amounts to such student loan project or projects, and such student loan project or projects shall be treated as a carry-forward project or projects in the specified carry-forward amount under the federal legislation.(5)For purposes of determining unused amounts and for purposes of determining the amount of the state's ceiling available pursuant to Section31-23-57, except as provided in subsection (2) above, during 1987 and 1989 amounts automatically allocated to the student loan portion as described above shall be treated as though a notice of allocation had been issued on January 1 of the applicable year, expiring on the last business day of such year.Laws, 1987, ch. 522, § 7, eff. 4/21/1987.\n\nLaws, 1987, ch. 522, § 7, eff. 4/21/1987.",
