However, if the school boards agreeing on the legal transfer of any student shall fail to agree on which district shall provide transportation, the responsibility for transporting the student to the transferee school district shall be that of the parent or guardian.(4)Upon the petition in writing of any parent or legal guardian of a school-age child who was lawfully transferred to another school district prior to July 1, 1992, as described in Section37-15-29(4), the school board of the transferee school district shall consent to the transfer of such child and the transfer of any school-age brother and sister of such child to its district, and shall spread the same upon the minutes of the board.(5)(a)If the board of trustees of a municipal separate school district with added territory does not have a member who is a resident of the added territory outside the corporate limits, upon the petition in writing of any parent or legal guardian of a school-age child who is a resident of the added territory outside the corporate limits, the board of trustees of the municipal separate school district and the school board of the school district adjacent to the added territory shall consent to the transfer of the child from the municipal separate school district to the adjacent school district. The agreement must be spread upon the minutes of the board of trustees of the municipal separate school district and the school board of the adjacent school district. The agreement must provide for the transportation of the student. In the absence of such a provision, the parent or legal guardian shall be responsible for transporting the student to the adjacent school district. Any school district that accepts a student under this subsection may not assess any tuition fees against the transferring student.(b)Before September 1 of each year, the board of trustees of the municipal separate school district shall certify to the State Department of Education the number of students in the added territory of the municipal separate school district who are transferred to the adjacent school district under this subsection. The municipal separate school district also shall certify the total number of students in the school district residing in the added territory plus the number of those students who are transferred to the adjacent school district. Based upon these figures, the department shall calculate the percentage of the total number of students in the added territory who are transferred to the adjacent school district and shall certify this percentage to the levying authority for the municipal separate school district. The levying authority shall remit to the school board of the adjacent school district, from the proceeds of the ad valorem taxes collected for the support of the municipal separate school district from the added territory of the municipal separate school district, an amount equal to the percentage of the total number of students in the added territory who are transferred to the adjacent school district.Codes, 1942, § 6248-07; Laws, 1953, Ex Sess, ch. 14, § 7; Laws, 1954, Ex Sess, ch. 25, §§ 1, 2 (Para.Para. 1, 2); Laws, 1960, ch. 296, §§ 1, 2; Laws, 1962, ch. 357, § 1; Laws, 1986, ch. 492, § 96; Laws, 1987, ch. 307, § 16; Laws, 1988, ch. 466, § 1; Laws, 1989, ch. 508, § 2; Laws, 1990, ch. 565, § 2; Laws, 1991, ch. 349, § 2; Laws, 1992, ch. 410, § 2; Laws, 1993, ch. 602, § 3; Laws, 1994, ch. 597, § 1, 1994, ch. 607, § 21; Laws, 2001, ch. 454, § 1, eff. 7/1/2001.\n\nCodes, 1942, § 6248-07; Laws, 1953, Ex Sess, ch. 14, § 7; Laws, 1954, Ex Sess, ch. 25, §§ 1, 2 (Para.Para. 1, 2); Laws, 1960, ch. 296, §§ 1, 2; Laws, 1962, ch. 357, § 1; Laws, 1986, ch. 492, § 96; Laws, 1987, ch. 307, § 16; Laws, 1988, ch. 466, § 1; Laws, 1989, ch. 508, § 2; Laws, 1990, ch. 565, § 2; Laws, 1991, ch. 349, § 2; Laws, 1992, ch. 410, § 2; Laws, 1993, ch. 602, § 3; Laws, 1994, ch. 597, § 1, 1994, ch. 607, § 21; Laws, 2001, ch. 454, § 1, eff. 7/1/2001.",
