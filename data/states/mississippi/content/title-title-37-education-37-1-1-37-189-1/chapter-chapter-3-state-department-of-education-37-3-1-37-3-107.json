The State Board of Education shall adopt rules requiring that teacher preparation institutions which provide the Teach Mississippi Institute (TMI) program for the preparation of nontraditional teachers shall meet the standards and comply with the provisions of this paragraph.1.The Teach Mississippi Institute (TMI) shall include an intensive eight-week, nine-semester-hour summer program or a curriculum of study in which the student matriculates in the fall or spring semester, which shall include, but not be limited to, instruction in education, effective teaching strategies, classroom management, state curriculum requirements, planning and instruction, instructional methods and pedagogy, using test results to improve instruction, and a one (1) semester three-hour supervised internship to be completed while the teacher is employed as a full-time teacher intern in a local school district. The TMI shall be implemented on a pilot program basis, with courses to be offered at up to four (4) locations in the state, with one (1) TMI site to be located in each of the three (3) Mississippi Supreme Court districts.2.The school sponsoring the teacher intern shall enter into a written agreement with the institution providing the Teach Mississippi Institute (TMI) program, under terms and conditions as agreed upon by the contracting parties, providing that the school district shall provide teacher interns seeking a nontraditional provisional teaching license with a one-year classroom teaching experience. The teacher intern shall successfully complete the one (1) semester three-hour intensive internship in the school district during the semester immediately following successful completion of the TMI and prior to the end of the one-year classroom teaching experience.3.Upon completion of the nine-semester-hour TMI or the fall or spring semester option, the individual shall submit his transcript to the commission for provisional licensure of the intern teacher, and the intern teacher shall be issued a provisional teaching license by the commission, which will allow the individual to legally serve as a teacher while the person completes a nontraditional teacher preparation internship program.4.During the semester of internship in the school district, the teacher preparation institution shall monitor the performance of the intern teacher. The school district that employs the provisional teacher shall supervise the provisional teacher during the teacher's intern year of employment under a nontraditional provisional license, and shall, in consultation with the teacher intern's mentor at the school district of employment, submit to the commission a comprehensive evaluation of the teacher's performance sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the nontraditional provisional license. If the comprehensive evaluation establishes that the provisional teacher intern's performance fails to meet the standards of the approved nontraditional teacher preparation internship program, the individual shall not be approved for a standard license.5.An individual issued a provisional teaching license under this nontraditional route shall successfully complete, at a minimum, a one-year beginning teacher mentoring and induction program administered by the employing school district with the assistance of the State Department of Education.6.Upon successful completion of the TMI and the internship provisional license period, applicants for a Standard License - Nontraditional Route shall submit to the commission a transcript of successful completion of the twelve (12) semester hours required in the internship program, and the employing school district shall submit to the commission a recommendation for standard licensure of the intern. If the school district recommends licensure, the applicant shall be issued a Standard License - Nontraditional Route which shall be valid for a five-year period and be renewable.7.At the discretion of the teacher preparation institution, the individual shall be allowed to credit the twelve (12) semester hours earned in the nontraditional teacher internship program toward the graduate hours required for a Master of Arts in Teacher (MAT) Degree.8.The local school district in which the nontraditional teacher intern or provisional licensee is employed shall compensate such teacher interns at Step 1 of the required salary level during the period of time such individual is completing teacher internship requirements and shall compensate such Standard License - Nontraditional Route teachers at Step 3 of the required salary level when they complete license requirements.(iii)Implementation of the TMI program provided for under this paragraph (b) shall be contingent upon the availability of funds appropriated specifically for such purpose by the Legislature. Such implementation of the TMI program may not be deemed to prohibit the State Board of Education from developing and implementing additional alternative route teacher licensure programs, as deemed appropriate by the board. The emergency certification program in effect prior to July 1, 2002, shall remain in effect.(iv)A Standard License - Approved Program Route shall be issued for a five-year period, and may be renewed. Recognizing teaching as a profession, a hiring preference shall be granted to persons holding a Standard License - Approved Program Route or Standard License - Nontraditional Teaching Route over persons holding any other license.(c)Special License - Expert Citizen.In order to allow a school district to offer specialized or technical courses, the State Department of Education, in accordance with rules and regulations established by the State Board of Education, may grant a five-year expert citizen-teacher license to local business or other professional personnel to teach in a public school or nonpublic school accredited or approved by the state. Such person shall be required to have a high school diploma, an industry-recognized certification related to the subject area in which they are teaching and a minimum of five (5) years of relevant experience but shall not be required to hold an associate or bachelor's degree, provided that he or she possesses the minimum qualifications required for his or her profession, and may begin teaching upon his employment by the local school board and licensure by the Mississippi Department of Education. If a school board hires a career technical education pathway instructor who does not have an industry certification in his or her area of expertise but does have the required experience, the school board shall spread their decision on the minutes at their next meeting and provide a detailed explanation for why they hired the instructor. Such instructor shall present the minutes of the school board to the State Department of Education when he or she applies for an expert citizen license. The board shall adopt rules and regulations to administer the expert citizen-teacher license. A Special License - Expert Citizen may be renewed in accordance with the established rules and regulations of the State Department of Education.(d)Special License - Nonrenewable.The State Board of Education is authorized to establish rules and regulations to allow those educators not meeting requirements in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection (6) to be licensed for a period of not more than three (3) years, except by special approval of the State Board of Education.(e)Nonlicensed Teaching Personnel.A nonlicensed person may teach for a maximum of three (3) periods per teaching day in a public school district or a nonpublic school accredited/approved by the state. Such person shall submit to the department a transcript or record of his education and experience which substantiates his preparation for the subject to be taught and shall meet other qualifications specified by the commission and approved by the State Board of Education. In no case shall any local school board hire nonlicensed personnel as authorized under this paragraph in excess of five percent (5%) of the total number of licensed personnel in any single school.(f)Special License - Transitional Bilingual Education.Beginning July 1, 2003, the commission shall grant special licenses to teachers of transitional bilingual education who possess such qualifications as are prescribed in this section.

A teacher of transitional bilingual education serving under a special license shall be under an exemption from standard licensure if he achieves the requisite qualifications therefor. Two (2) years of service by a teacher of transitional bilingual education under such an exemption shall be credited to the teacher in acquiring a Standard Educator License. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prohibit a local school board from employing a teacher licensed in an appropriate field as approved by the State Department of Education to teach in a program in transitional bilingual education.(g)In the event any school district meets the highest accreditation standards as defined by the State Board of Education in the accountability system, the State Board of Education, in its discretion, may exempt such school district from any restrictions in paragraph (e) relating to the employment of nonlicensed teaching personnel.(h)Highly Qualified Teachers.Beginning July 1, 2006, any teacher from any state meeting the federal definition of highly qualified, as described in the No Child Left Behind Act, must be granted a standard five-year license by the State Department of Education.(7)Administrator License.The State Board of Education is authorized to establish rules and regulations and to administer the licensure process of the school administrators in the State of Mississippi. There will be four (4) categories of administrator licensure with exceptions only through special approval of the State Board of Education.(a)Administrator License - Nonpracticing.Those educators holding administrative endorsement but having no administrative experience or not serving in an administrative position on January 15, 1997.(b)Administrator License - Entry Level.Those educators holding administrative endorsement and having met the department's qualifications to be eligible for employment in a Mississippi school district.

Successful completion of the requirements of alternate route licensure for administrators shall qualify the person for a standard administrator license.Individuals seeking school administrator licensure under paragraph (b), (c) or (d) shall successfully complete a training program and an assessment process prescribed by the State Board of Education. All applicants for school administrator licensure shall meet all requirements prescribed by the department under paragraph (b), (c) or (d), and the cost of the assessment process required shall be paid by the applicant.(8)Reciprocity.The department shall grant a standard five-year license to any individual who possesses a valid standard license from another state, or another country or political subdivision thereof, within a period of twenty-one (21) days from the date of a completed application. The issuance of a license by reciprocity to a military-trained applicant, military spouse or person who establishes residence in this state shall be subject to the provisions of Section73-50-1or73-50-2, as applicable.(9)Renewal and Reinstatement of Licenses.The State Board of Education is authorized to establish rules and regulations for the renewal and reinstatement of educator and administrator licenses. Effective May 15, 1997, the valid standard license held by an educator shall be extended five (5) years beyond the expiration date of the license in order to afford the educator adequate time to fulfill new renewal requirements established pursuant to this subsection. An educator completing a master of education, educational specialist or doctor of education degree in May 1997 for the purpose of upgrading the educator's license to a higher class shall be given this extension of five (5) years plus five (5) additional years for completion of a higher degree. For all license types with a current valid expiration date of June 30, 2021, the State Department of Education shall grant a one-year extension to June 30, 2022. Beginning July 1, 2022, and thereafter, applicants for licensure renewal shall meet all requirements in effect on the date that the complete application is received by the State Department of Education.(10)All controversies involving the issuance, revocation, suspension or any change whatsoever in the licensure of an educator required to hold a license shall be initially heard in a hearing de novo, by the commission or by a subcommittee established by the commission and composed of commission members, or by a hearing officer retained and appointed by the commission, for the purpose of holding hearings. Any complaint seeking the denial of issuance, revocation or suspension of a license shall be by sworn affidavit filed with the Commission on Teacher and Administrator Education, Certification and Licensure and Development. The decision thereon by the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer, shall be final, unless the aggrieved party shall appeal to the State Board of Education, within ten (10) days, of the decision of the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer. An appeal to the State Board of Education shall be perfected upon filing a notice of the appeal and by the prepayment of the costs of the preparation of the record of proceedings by the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer.

The commission shall require all who petition for reinstatement to furnish evidence satisfactory to the commission of good character, good mental, emotional and physical health and such other evidence as the commission may deem necessary to establish the petitioner's rehabilitation and fitness to perform the duties authorized by the license.(b)A person whose license expires while under investigation by the Office of Educator Misconduct for an alleged violation may not be reinstated without a hearing before the commission if required based on the results of the investigation.(15)Reporting procedures and hearing procedures for dealing with infractions under this section shall be promulgated by the commission, subject to the approval of the State Board of Education. The revocation or suspension of a license shall be effected at the time indicated on the notice of suspension or revocation. The commission shall immediately notify the superintendent of the school district or school board where the teacher or administrator is employed of any disciplinary action and also notify the teacher or administrator of such revocation or suspension and shall maintain records of action taken. The State Board of Education may reverse or remand with instructions any decision of the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer regarding a petition for reinstatement of a license, and any such decision of the State Board of Education shall be final.(16)An appeal from the action of the State Board of Education in denying an application, revoking or suspending a license or otherwise disciplining any person under the provisions of this section shall be filed in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, on the record made, including a verbatim transcript of the testimony at the hearing. The appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days after notification of the action of the board is mailed or served and the proceedings in chancery court shall be conducted as other matters coming before the court. The appeal shall be perfected upon filing notice of the appeal and by the prepayment of all costs, including the cost of preparation of the record of the proceedings by the State Board of Education, and the filing of a bond in the sum of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) conditioned that if the action of the board be affirmed by the chancery court, the applicant or license holder shall pay the costs of the appeal and the action of the chancery court.(17)All such programs, rules, regulations, standards and criteria recommended or authorized by the commission shall become effective upon approval by the State Board of Education as designated by appropriate orders entered upon the minutes thereof.(18)The granting of a license shall not be deemed a property right nor a guarantee of employment in any public school district. A license is a privilege indicating minimal eligibility for teaching in the public school districts of Mississippi. This section shall in no way alter or abridge the authority of local school districts to require greater qualifications or standards of performance as a prerequisite of initial or continued employment in such districts.(19)In addition to the reasons specified in subsections (12) and (13) of this section, the board shall be authorized to suspend the license of any licensee for being out of compliance with an order for support, as defined in Section93-11-153. The procedure for suspension of a license for being out of compliance with an order for support, and the procedure for the reissuance or reinstatement of a license suspended for that purpose, and the payment of any fees for the reissuance or reinstatement of a license suspended for that purpose, shall be governed by Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be. Actions taken by the board in suspending a license when required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163are not actions from which an appeal may be taken under this section. Any appeal of a license suspension that is required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163shall be taken in accordance with the appeal procedure specified in Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be, rather than the procedure specified in this section. If there is any conflict between any provision of Section93-11-157or93-11-163and any provision of this chapter, the provisions of Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be, shall control.(20)The Department of Education shall grant and renew all licenses and certifications of teachers and administrators within twenty-one (21) days from the date of a completed application if the applicant has otherwise met all established requirements for the license or certification.Laws, 1982, Ex Sess, ch. 17, § 10; Laws, 1988, ch. 464, § 1; Laws, 1988, ch. 536, § 1; Laws, 1989, ch. 373, § 1; Laws, 1991, ch. 502, § 1; Laws, 1991, ch. 534, § 1; Laws, 1992, ch. 519, § 2; Laws, 1992, ch. 524, § 2; Laws, 1993, ch. 594, § 1; Laws, 1994, ch. 596, § 1; Laws, 1994, ch. 581, § 16; Laws, 1996, ch. 507, § 9; Laws, 1996, ch. 540, § 1; Laws, 1997, ch. 545, § 1; Laws, 2000, ch. 432, § 1; Laws, 2000, ch. 550, § 1; Laws, 2002, ch. 587, § 1; Laws, 2004, ch. 409, § 1; Laws, 2004, ch. 478, § 1; Laws, 2006, ch. 504, § 3; reenacted without change, Laws, 2009, ch. 345, § 2; reenacted and amended, Laws, 2009, ch. 445, § 2; Laws, 2011, ch. 514, § 1; Laws, 2012, ch. 376, § 1, eff. 7/1/2012.Amended by Laws, 2022, ch. 370, HB 1388,§ 8, eff. 7/1/2022.Amended by Laws, 2021, ch. 463, SB 2267,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2021.Amended by Laws, 2021, ch. 398, HB 1263,§ 2, eff. 7/1/2021.Amended by Laws, 2020, ch. 348, SB 2511,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2020.Amended by Laws, 2019, ch. 455, HB 578,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2019.Amended by Laws, 2015, ch. 470, SB 2258, 2, eff. 4/22/2015.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 536, SB 2572, 3, eff. 7/1/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 458, HB 455, 3, eff. 3/31/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 397, HB 460, 8, eff. 7/1/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 318, SB 2575, 1, eff. 3/13/2014.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 497, HB 369, 39, eff. 7/1/2013.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 496, SB 2188, 1, eff. 7/1/2013.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 350, SB 2419, 3, eff. 7/1/2013.\n\n(1)There is established within the State Department of Education the Commission on Teacher and Administrator Education, Certification and Licensure and Development.

The State Board of Education shall adopt rules requiring that teacher preparation institutions which provide the Teach Mississippi Institute (TMI) program for the preparation of nontraditional teachers shall meet the standards and comply with the provisions of this paragraph.1.The Teach Mississippi Institute (TMI) shall include an intensive eight-week, nine-semester-hour summer program or a curriculum of study in which the student matriculates in the fall or spring semester, which shall include, but not be limited to, instruction in education, effective teaching strategies, classroom management, state curriculum requirements, planning and instruction, instructional methods and pedagogy, using test results to improve instruction, and a one (1) semester three-hour supervised internship to be completed while the teacher is employed as a full-time teacher intern in a local school district. The TMI shall be implemented on a pilot program basis, with courses to be offered at up to four (4) locations in the state, with one (1) TMI site to be located in each of the three (3) Mississippi Supreme Court districts.2.The school sponsoring the teacher intern shall enter into a written agreement with the institution providing the Teach Mississippi Institute (TMI) program, under terms and conditions as agreed upon by the contracting parties, providing that the school district shall provide teacher interns seeking a nontraditional provisional teaching license with a one-year classroom teaching experience. The teacher intern shall successfully complete the one (1) semester three-hour intensive internship in the school district during the semester immediately following successful completion of the TMI and prior to the end of the one-year classroom teaching experience.3.Upon completion of the nine-semester-hour TMI or the fall or spring semester option, the individual shall submit his transcript to the commission for provisional licensure of the intern teacher, and the intern teacher shall be issued a provisional teaching license by the commission, which will allow the individual to legally serve as a teacher while the person completes a nontraditional teacher preparation internship program.4.During the semester of internship in the school district, the teacher preparation institution shall monitor the performance of the intern teacher. The school district that employs the provisional teacher shall supervise the provisional teacher during the teacher's intern year of employment under a nontraditional provisional license, and shall, in consultation with the teacher intern's mentor at the school district of employment, submit to the commission a comprehensive evaluation of the teacher's performance sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the nontraditional provisional license. If the comprehensive evaluation establishes that the provisional teacher intern's performance fails to meet the standards of the approved nontraditional teacher preparation internship program, the individual shall not be approved for a standard license.5.An individual issued a provisional teaching license under this nontraditional route shall successfully complete, at a minimum, a one-year beginning teacher mentoring and induction program administered by the employing school district with the assistance of the State Department of Education.6.Upon successful completion of the TMI and the internship provisional license period, applicants for a Standard License - Nontraditional Route shall submit to the commission a transcript of successful completion of the twelve (12) semester hours required in the internship program, and the employing school district shall submit to the commission a recommendation for standard licensure of the intern.

Such implementation of the TMI program may not be deemed to prohibit the State Board of Education from developing and implementing additional alternative route teacher licensure programs, as deemed appropriate by the board. The emergency certification program in effect prior to July 1, 2002, shall remain in effect.(iv)A Standard License - Approved Program Route shall be issued for a five-year period, and may be renewed. Recognizing teaching as a profession, a hiring preference shall be granted to persons holding a Standard License - Approved Program Route or Standard License - Nontraditional Teaching Route over persons holding any other license.(c)Special License - Expert Citizen.In order to allow a school district to offer specialized or technical courses, the State Department of Education, in accordance with rules and regulations established by the State Board of Education, may grant a five-year expert citizen-teacher license to local business or other professional personnel to teach in a public school or nonpublic school accredited or approved by the state. Such person shall be required to have a high school diploma, an industry-recognized certification related to the subject area in which they are teaching and a minimum of five (5) years of relevant experience but shall not be required to hold an associate or bachelor's degree, provided that he or she possesses the minimum qualifications required for his or her profession, and may begin teaching upon his employment by the local school board and licensure by the Mississippi Department of Education. If a school board hires a career technical education pathway instructor who does not have an industry certification in his or her area of expertise but does have the required experience, the school board shall spread their decision on the minutes at their next meeting and provide a detailed explanation for why they hired the instructor. Such instructor shall present the minutes of the school board to the State Department of Education when he or she applies for an expert citizen license. The board shall adopt rules and regulations to administer the expert citizen-teacher license. A Special License - Expert Citizen may be renewed in accordance with the established rules and regulations of the State Department of Education.(d)Special License - Nonrenewable.The State Board of Education is authorized to establish rules and regulations to allow those educators not meeting requirements in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection (6) to be licensed for a period of not more than three (3) years, except by special approval of the State Board of Education.(e)Nonlicensed Teaching Personnel.A nonlicensed person may teach for a maximum of three (3) periods per teaching day in a public school district or a nonpublic school accredited/approved by the state. Such person shall submit to the department a transcript or record of his education and experience which substantiates his preparation for the subject to be taught and shall meet other qualifications specified by the commission and approved by the State Board of Education. In no case shall any local school board hire nonlicensed personnel as authorized under this paragraph in excess of five percent (5%) of the total number of licensed personnel in any single school.(f)Special License - Transitional Bilingual Education.Beginning July 1, 2003, the commission shall grant special licenses to teachers of transitional bilingual education who possess such qualifications as are prescribed in this section.

A teacher of transitional bilingual education serving under a special license shall be under an exemption from standard licensure if he achieves the requisite qualifications therefor. Two (2) years of service by a teacher of transitional bilingual education under such an exemption shall be credited to the teacher in acquiring a Standard Educator License. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prohibit a local school board from employing a teacher licensed in an appropriate field as approved by the State Department of Education to teach in a program in transitional bilingual education.(g)In the event any school district meets the highest accreditation standards as defined by the State Board of Education in the accountability system, the State Board of Education, in its discretion, may exempt such school district from any restrictions in paragraph (e) relating to the employment of nonlicensed teaching personnel.(h)Highly Qualified Teachers.Beginning July 1, 2006, any teacher from any state meeting the federal definition of highly qualified, as described in the No Child Left Behind Act, must be granted a standard five-year license by the State Department of Education.(7)Administrator License.The State Board of Education is authorized to establish rules and regulations and to administer the licensure process of the school administrators in the State of Mississippi.

All applicants for school administrator licensure shall meet all requirements prescribed by the department under paragraph (b), (c) or (d), and the cost of the assessment process required shall be paid by the applicant.(8)Reciprocity.The department shall grant a standard five-year license to any individual who possesses a valid standard license from another state, or another country or political subdivision thereof, within a period of twenty-one (21) days from the date of a completed application. The issuance of a license by reciprocity to a military-trained applicant, military spouse or person who establishes residence in this state shall be subject to the provisions of Section73-50-1or73-50-2, as applicable.(9)Renewal and Reinstatement of Licenses.The State Board of Education is authorized to establish rules and regulations for the renewal and reinstatement of educator and administrator licenses. Effective May 15, 1997, the valid standard license held by an educator shall be extended five (5) years beyond the expiration date of the license in order to afford the educator adequate time to fulfill new renewal requirements established pursuant to this subsection. An educator completing a master of education, educational specialist or doctor of education degree in May 1997 for the purpose of upgrading the educator's license to a higher class shall be given this extension of five (5) years plus five (5) additional years for completion of a higher degree. For all license types with a current valid expiration date of June 30, 2021, the State Department of Education shall grant a one-year extension to June 30, 2022.

Any complaint seeking the denial of issuance, revocation or suspension of a license shall be by sworn affidavit filed with the Commission on Teacher and Administrator Education, Certification and Licensure and Development. The decision thereon by the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer, shall be final, unless the aggrieved party shall appeal to the State Board of Education, within ten (10) days, of the decision of the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer. An appeal to the State Board of Education shall be perfected upon filing a notice of the appeal and by the prepayment of the costs of the preparation of the record of proceedings by the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer. An appeal shall be on the record previously made before the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer, unless otherwise provided by rules and regulations adopted by the board. The decision of the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer shall not be disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence, was not arbitrary or capricious, within the authority of the commission, and did not violate some statutory or constitutional right. The State Board of Education in its authority may reverse, or remand with instructions, the decision of the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer.

Failure to complete the requirements in the time specified shall result in immediate suspension of the license for one (1) year.(13)(a)Dismissal or suspension of a licensed employee by a local school board pursuant to Section37-9-59may result in the suspension or revocation of a license for a length of time which shall be determined by the commission and based upon the severity of the offense.(b)Any offense committed or attempted in any other state shall result in the same penalty as if committed or attempted in this state.(c)A person may voluntarily surrender a license. The surrender of such license may result in the commission recommending any of the above penalties without the necessity of a hearing. However, any such license which has voluntarily been surrendered by a licensed employee may only be reinstated by a majority vote of all members of the commission present at the meeting called for such purpose.(14)(a)A person whose license has been suspended or surrendered on any grounds except criminal grounds may petition for reinstatement of the license after one (1) year from the date of suspension or surrender, or after one-half (1/2) of the suspended or surrendered time has lapsed, whichever is greater.

The commission shall immediately notify the superintendent of the school district or school board where the teacher or administrator is employed of any disciplinary action and also notify the teacher or administrator of such revocation or suspension and shall maintain records of action taken. The State Board of Education may reverse or remand with instructions any decision of the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer regarding a petition for reinstatement of a license, and any such decision of the State Board of Education shall be final.(16)An appeal from the action of the State Board of Education in denying an application, revoking or suspending a license or otherwise disciplining any person under the provisions of this section shall be filed in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, on the record made, including a verbatim transcript of the testimony at the hearing. The appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days after notification of the action of the board is mailed or served and the proceedings in chancery court shall be conducted as other matters coming before the court. The appeal shall be perfected upon filing notice of the appeal and by the prepayment of all costs, including the cost of preparation of the record of the proceedings by the State Board of Education, and the filing of a bond in the sum of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) conditioned that if the action of the board be affirmed by the chancery court, the applicant or license holder shall pay the costs of the appeal and the action of the chancery court.(17)All such programs, rules, regulations, standards and criteria recommended or authorized by the commission shall become effective upon approval by the State Board of Education as designated by appropriate orders entered upon the minutes thereof.(18)The granting of a license shall not be deemed a property right nor a guarantee of employment in any public school district. A license is a privilege indicating minimal eligibility for teaching in the public school districts of Mississippi. This section shall in no way alter or abridge the authority of local school districts to require greater qualifications or standards of performance as a prerequisite of initial or continued employment in such districts.(19)In addition to the reasons specified in subsections (12) and (13) of this section, the board shall be authorized to suspend the license of any licensee for being out of compliance with an order for support, as defined in Section93-11-153. The procedure for suspension of a license for being out of compliance with an order for support, and the procedure for the reissuance or reinstatement of a license suspended for that purpose, and the payment of any fees for the reissuance or reinstatement of a license suspended for that purpose, shall be governed by Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be. Actions taken by the board in suspending a license when required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163are not actions from which an appeal may be taken under this section. Any appeal of a license suspension that is required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163shall be taken in accordance with the appeal procedure specified in Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be, rather than the procedure specified in this section. If there is any conflict between any provision of Section93-11-157or93-11-163and any provision of this chapter, the provisions of Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be, shall control.(20)The Department of Education shall grant and renew all licenses and certifications of teachers and administrators within twenty-one (21) days from the date of a completed application if the applicant has otherwise met all established requirements for the license or certification.Laws, 1982, Ex Sess, ch. 17, § 10; Laws, 1988, ch. 464, § 1; Laws, 1988, ch. 536, § 1; Laws, 1989, ch. 373, § 1; Laws, 1991, ch. 502, § 1; Laws, 1991, ch. 534, § 1; Laws, 1992, ch. 519, § 2; Laws, 1992, ch. 524, § 2; Laws, 1993, ch. 594, § 1; Laws, 1994, ch. 596, § 1; Laws, 1994, ch. 581, § 16; Laws, 1996, ch. 507, § 9; Laws, 1996, ch. 540, § 1; Laws, 1997, ch. 545, § 1; Laws, 2000, ch. 432, § 1; Laws, 2000, ch. 550, § 1; Laws, 2002, ch. 587, § 1; Laws, 2004, ch. 409, § 1; Laws, 2004, ch. 478, § 1; Laws, 2006, ch. 504, § 3; reenacted without change, Laws, 2009, ch. 345, § 2; reenacted and amended, Laws, 2009, ch. 445, § 2; Laws, 2011, ch. 514, § 1; Laws, 2012, ch. 376, § 1, eff. 7/1/2012.Amended by Laws, 2022, ch. 370, HB 1388,§ 8, eff. 7/1/2022.Amended by Laws, 2021, ch. 463, SB 2267,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2021.Amended by Laws, 2021, ch. 398, HB 1263,§ 2, eff. 7/1/2021.Amended by Laws, 2020, ch. 348, SB 2511,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2020.Amended by Laws, 2019, ch. 455, HB 578,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2019.Amended by Laws, 2015, ch. 470, SB 2258, 2, eff. 4/22/2015.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 536, SB 2572, 3, eff. 7/1/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 458, HB 455, 3, eff. 3/31/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 397, HB 460, 8, eff. 7/1/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 318, SB 2575, 1, eff. 3/13/2014.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 497, HB 369, 39, eff. 7/1/2013.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 496, SB 2188, 1, eff. 7/1/2013.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 350, SB 2419, 3, eff. 7/1/2013.\n\n(1)There is established within the State Department of Education the Commission on Teacher and Administrator Education, Certification and Licensure and Development.

The State Board of Education shall adopt rules requiring that teacher preparation institutions which provide the Teach Mississippi Institute (TMI) program for the preparation of nontraditional teachers shall meet the standards and comply with the provisions of this paragraph.1.The Teach Mississippi Institute (TMI) shall include an intensive eight-week, nine-semester-hour summer program or a curriculum of study in which the student matriculates in the fall or spring semester, which shall include, but not be limited to, instruction in education, effective teaching strategies, classroom management, state curriculum requirements, planning and instruction, instructional methods and pedagogy, using test results to improve instruction, and a one (1) semester three-hour supervised internship to be completed while the teacher is employed as a full-time teacher intern in a local school district. The TMI shall be implemented on a pilot program basis, with courses to be offered at up to four (4) locations in the state, with one (1) TMI site to be located in each of the three (3) Mississippi Supreme Court districts.2.The school sponsoring the teacher intern shall enter into a written agreement with the institution providing the Teach Mississippi Institute (TMI) program, under terms and conditions as agreed upon by the contracting parties, providing that the school district shall provide teacher interns seeking a nontraditional provisional teaching license with a one-year classroom teaching experience. The teacher intern shall successfully complete the one (1) semester three-hour intensive internship in the school district during the semester immediately following successful completion of the TMI and prior to the end of the one-year classroom teaching experience.3.Upon completion of the nine-semester-hour TMI or the fall or spring semester option, the individual shall submit his transcript to the commission for provisional licensure of the intern teacher, and the intern teacher shall be issued a provisional teaching license by the commission, which will allow the individual to legally serve as a teacher while the person completes a nontraditional teacher preparation internship program.4.During the semester of internship in the school district, the teacher preparation institution shall monitor the performance of the intern teacher. The school district that employs the provisional teacher shall supervise the provisional teacher during the teacher's intern year of employment under a nontraditional provisional license, and shall, in consultation with the teacher intern's mentor at the school district of employment, submit to the commission a comprehensive evaluation of the teacher's performance sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the nontraditional provisional license. If the comprehensive evaluation establishes that the provisional teacher intern's performance fails to meet the standards of the approved nontraditional teacher preparation internship program, the individual shall not be approved for a standard license.5.An individual issued a provisional teaching license under this nontraditional route shall successfully complete, at a minimum, a one-year beginning teacher mentoring and induction program administered by the employing school district with the assistance of the State Department of Education.6.Upon successful completion of the TMI and the internship provisional license period, applicants for a Standard License - Nontraditional Route shall submit to the commission a transcript of successful completion of the twelve (12) semester hours required in the internship program, and the employing school district shall submit to the commission a recommendation for standard licensure of the intern.

Such implementation of the TMI program may not be deemed to prohibit the State Board of Education from developing and implementing additional alternative route teacher licensure programs, as deemed appropriate by the board. The emergency certification program in effect prior to July 1, 2002, shall remain in effect.(iv)A Standard License - Approved Program Route shall be issued for a five-year period, and may be renewed. Recognizing teaching as a profession, a hiring preference shall be granted to persons holding a Standard License - Approved Program Route or Standard License - Nontraditional Teaching Route over persons holding any other license.(c)Special License - Expert Citizen.In order to allow a school district to offer specialized or technical courses, the State Department of Education, in accordance with rules and regulations established by the State Board of Education, may grant a five-year expert citizen-teacher license to local business or other professional personnel to teach in a public school or nonpublic school accredited or approved by the state. Such person shall be required to have a high school diploma, an industry-recognized certification related to the subject area in which they are teaching and a minimum of five (5) years of relevant experience but shall not be required to hold an associate or bachelor's degree, provided that he or she possesses the minimum qualifications required for his or her profession, and may begin teaching upon his employment by the local school board and licensure by the Mississippi Department of Education. If a school board hires a career technical education pathway instructor who does not have an industry certification in his or her area of expertise but does have the required experience, the school board shall spread their decision on the minutes at their next meeting and provide a detailed explanation for why they hired the instructor. Such instructor shall present the minutes of the school board to the State Department of Education when he or she applies for an expert citizen license. The board shall adopt rules and regulations to administer the expert citizen-teacher license. A Special License - Expert Citizen may be renewed in accordance with the established rules and regulations of the State Department of Education.(d)Special License - Nonrenewable.The State Board of Education is authorized to establish rules and regulations to allow those educators not meeting requirements in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection (6) to be licensed for a period of not more than three (3) years, except by special approval of the State Board of Education.(e)Nonlicensed Teaching Personnel.A nonlicensed person may teach for a maximum of three (3) periods per teaching day in a public school district or a nonpublic school accredited/approved by the state. Such person shall submit to the department a transcript or record of his education and experience which substantiates his preparation for the subject to be taught and shall meet other qualifications specified by the commission and approved by the State Board of Education. In no case shall any local school board hire nonlicensed personnel as authorized under this paragraph in excess of five percent (5%) of the total number of licensed personnel in any single school.(f)Special License - Transitional Bilingual Education.Beginning July 1, 2003, the commission shall grant special licenses to teachers of transitional bilingual education who possess such qualifications as are prescribed in this section.

A teacher of transitional bilingual education serving under a special license shall be under an exemption from standard licensure if he achieves the requisite qualifications therefor. Two (2) years of service by a teacher of transitional bilingual education under such an exemption shall be credited to the teacher in acquiring a Standard Educator License. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prohibit a local school board from employing a teacher licensed in an appropriate field as approved by the State Department of Education to teach in a program in transitional bilingual education.(g)In the event any school district meets the highest accreditation standards as defined by the State Board of Education in the accountability system, the State Board of Education, in its discretion, may exempt such school district from any restrictions in paragraph (e) relating to the employment of nonlicensed teaching personnel.(h)Highly Qualified Teachers.Beginning July 1, 2006, any teacher from any state meeting the federal definition of highly qualified, as described in the No Child Left Behind Act, must be granted a standard five-year license by the State Department of Education.(7)Administrator License.The State Board of Education is authorized to establish rules and regulations and to administer the licensure process of the school administrators in the State of Mississippi. There will be four (4) categories of administrator licensure with exceptions only through special approval of the State Board of Education.(a)Administrator License - Nonpracticing.Those educators holding administrative endorsement but having no administrative experience or not serving in an administrative position on January 15, 1997.(b)Administrator License - Entry Level.Those educators holding administrative endorsement and having met the department's qualifications to be eligible for employment in a Mississippi school district.

Successful completion of the requirements of alternate route licensure for administrators shall qualify the person for a standard administrator license.Individuals seeking school administrator licensure under paragraph (b), (c) or (d) shall successfully complete a training program and an assessment process prescribed by the State Board of Education. All applicants for school administrator licensure shall meet all requirements prescribed by the department under paragraph (b), (c) or (d), and the cost of the assessment process required shall be paid by the applicant.(8)Reciprocity.The department shall grant a standard five-year license to any individual who possesses a valid standard license from another state, or another country or political subdivision thereof, within a period of twenty-one (21) days from the date of a completed application. The issuance of a license by reciprocity to a military-trained applicant, military spouse or person who establishes residence in this state shall be subject to the provisions of Section73-50-1or73-50-2, as applicable.(9)Renewal and Reinstatement of Licenses.The State Board of Education is authorized to establish rules and regulations for the renewal and reinstatement of educator and administrator licenses. Effective May 15, 1997, the valid standard license held by an educator shall be extended five (5) years beyond the expiration date of the license in order to afford the educator adequate time to fulfill new renewal requirements established pursuant to this subsection. An educator completing a master of education, educational specialist or doctor of education degree in May 1997 for the purpose of upgrading the educator's license to a higher class shall be given this extension of five (5) years plus five (5) additional years for completion of a higher degree. For all license types with a current valid expiration date of June 30, 2021, the State Department of Education shall grant a one-year extension to June 30, 2022. Beginning July 1, 2022, and thereafter, applicants for licensure renewal shall meet all requirements in effect on the date that the complete application is received by the State Department of Education.(10)All controversies involving the issuance, revocation, suspension or any change whatsoever in the licensure of an educator required to hold a license shall be initially heard in a hearing de novo, by the commission or by a subcommittee established by the commission and composed of commission members, or by a hearing officer retained and appointed by the commission, for the purpose of holding hearings. Any complaint seeking the denial of issuance, revocation or suspension of a license shall be by sworn affidavit filed with the Commission on Teacher and Administrator Education, Certification and Licensure and Development. The decision thereon by the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer, shall be final, unless the aggrieved party shall appeal to the State Board of Education, within ten (10) days, of the decision of the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer. An appeal to the State Board of Education shall be perfected upon filing a notice of the appeal and by the prepayment of the costs of the preparation of the record of proceedings by the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer. An appeal shall be on the record previously made before the commission, its subcommittee or hearing officer, unless otherwise provided by rules and regulations adopted by the board.

Actions taken by the board in suspending a license when required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163are not actions from which an appeal may be taken under this section. Any appeal of a license suspension that is required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163shall be taken in accordance with the appeal procedure specified in Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be, rather than the procedure specified in this section. If there is any conflict between any provision of Section93-11-157or93-11-163and any provision of this chapter, the provisions of Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be, shall control.(20)The Department of Education shall grant and renew all licenses and certifications of teachers and administrators within twenty-one (21) days from the date of a completed application if the applicant has otherwise met all established requirements for the license or certification.Laws, 1982, Ex Sess, ch. 17, § 10; Laws, 1988, ch. 464, § 1; Laws, 1988, ch. 536, § 1; Laws, 1989, ch. 373, § 1; Laws, 1991, ch. 502, § 1; Laws, 1991, ch. 534, § 1; Laws, 1992, ch. 519, § 2; Laws, 1992, ch. 524, § 2; Laws, 1993, ch. 594, § 1; Laws, 1994, ch. 596, § 1; Laws, 1994, ch. 581, § 16; Laws, 1996, ch. 507, § 9; Laws, 1996, ch. 540, § 1; Laws, 1997, ch. 545, § 1; Laws, 2000, ch. 432, § 1; Laws, 2000, ch. 550, § 1; Laws, 2002, ch. 587, § 1; Laws, 2004, ch. 409, § 1; Laws, 2004, ch. 478, § 1; Laws, 2006, ch. 504, § 3; reenacted without change, Laws, 2009, ch. 345, § 2; reenacted and amended, Laws, 2009, ch. 445, § 2; Laws, 2011, ch. 514, § 1; Laws, 2012, ch. 376, § 1, eff. 7/1/2012.Amended by Laws, 2022, ch. 370, HB 1388,§ 8, eff. 7/1/2022.Amended by Laws, 2021, ch. 463, SB 2267,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2021.Amended by Laws, 2021, ch. 398, HB 1263,§ 2, eff. 7/1/2021.Amended by Laws, 2020, ch. 348, SB 2511,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2020.Amended by Laws, 2019, ch. 455, HB 578,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2019.Amended by Laws, 2015, ch. 470, SB 2258, 2, eff. 4/22/2015.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 536, SB 2572, 3, eff. 7/1/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 458, HB 455, 3, eff. 3/31/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 397, HB 460, 8, eff. 7/1/2014.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 318, SB 2575, 1, eff. 3/13/2014.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 497, HB 369, 39, eff. 7/1/2013.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 496, SB 2188, 1, eff. 7/1/2013.Amended by Laws, 2013, ch. 350, SB 2419, 3, eff. 7/1/2013.\n\nIndividuals seeking school administrator licensure under paragraph (b), (c) or (d) shall successfully complete a training program and an assessment process prescribed by the State Board of Education.

The MCOPS program shall authorize the State Department of Education to make grants to increase deployment of law enforcement officers in order (a) to increase or enhance community policing in this state, (b) that trained, sworn enforcement officers assigned to schools play an integral part in the development and/or enhancement of a comprehensive school safety plan, and (c) that the presence of these officers shall provide schools with a direct link to local law enforcement agencies.(2)The MCOPS program shall meet the following requirements and standards:(a)This program shall provide an incentive for law enforcement agencies to build collaborative partnerships with the school community and to use community policing efforts to combat school violence and implement educational programs to improve student and school safety.(b)The additional School Resource Officers must devote at least seventy-five percent (75%) of their time to work in and around primary and secondary schools, in addition to the time that School Resource Officers are devoting in the absence of the MCOPS in Schools grant.(c)Beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, the MCOPS in Schools program shall provide a minimum state contribution of up to Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) per officer position over the one-year grant period, to be matched from local funds on a 50/50 matching basis. Officers paid with MCOPS funds may be employed by the local law enforcement agency or by the local school district. MCOPS funds may be used to pay for entry-level salaries and benefits of newly trained additional School Resource Officers and may be used to pay the salaries and benefits of School Resource Officers employed prior to July 1, 2013. All jurisdictions that apply must demonstrate that they have primary law enforcement authority over the school(s) identified in their application and demonstrate their inability to implement this project without state assistance. Schools or law enforcement agencies may not reduce its overall federal, state, locally funded level of sworn officers (including other School Resource Officers or other sworn officers assigned to the schools) as a result of applying for or receiving MCOPS in Schools grant funding. MCOPS in Schools funding may be used to rehire sworn officers previously employed who have been laid off for financial reasons unrelated to the availability of the MCOPS in Schools grant, but must obtain prior written approval from the State Department of Education. MCOPS in Schools funding may be used to train school resource officers. In order to be eligible for such program, each local school board desiring to participate shall apply to the State Department of Education by May 31 before the beginning of the applicable fiscal year on forms provided by the department.
