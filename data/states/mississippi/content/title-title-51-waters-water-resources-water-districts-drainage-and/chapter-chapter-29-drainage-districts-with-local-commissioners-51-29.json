The assessment shall embrace not merely the land, but all railroad and other improvements on lands which will be benefited by the drainage system. In preparing the description of the lands so assessed, the commissioners may use either (1) the descriptions of lands and subdivisions thereof as shown on the official United States Government surveys and plats of lands within the district; (2) the descriptions of lands and subdivisions thereof as shown upon any plat of lands within the district and recorded upon the land records of the county in which said lands are located; (3) any metes and bounds descriptions found in the latest filed conveyance of said lands and of record in the records of deeds of the county in which said lands are located, and in such case it shall be sufficient to describe said lands by stating the number of acres and the general location of the land within the section, together with the book and page numbers of said conveyance. They shall place opposite each tract of land the name of the supposed owner, as shown by the last county land assessment roll; but a mistake in the name shall not vitiate the assessment. If any landowner or private corporation or any other drainage district has dug ditches or made drainage work that can be profitably used as a part of the general proposed system, the value of such ditches or drainage work to the district shall be assessed by said commissioners and shall appear upon the assessment and be paid for by the district, either in cash or by reduction of assessment. The commissioners shall also assess and place upon said roll or book of assessment, opposite each tract of land, all damages that will accrue to any landowner by reason of the proposed improvement, including all injury to lands taken or damaged; and when said commissioners return no assessment of damages as to any tract of land, it shall be deemed a finding by them that no damages will be sustained. If the commissioners, at any time either before or after the organization of the district, find that other land not embraced within the boundaries of the district will be benefited by the proposed improvement or improvements already made, they shall assess the estimated benefit to such lands and shall specially report to the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, the assessments which they have made on land beyond the boundaries of the district, as already established. It shall thereupon be the duty of the clerk of the chancery court to give notice by two (2) weekly insertions in a newspaper published in the county where such lands lie describing the additional lands which have been assessed; and the owners of real property so assessed shall be allowed not less than ten (10) days after the last publication of such notice in which to file with the clerk of the chancery court their protest against being so assessed, or included within the district. The chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, shall, at its next succeeding session after the time for filing of such protest shall have expired, investigate the question whether the lands beyond the boundaries of the district so assessed by the commissioners will in fact be benefited by the making of the improvement, and from its finding in that regard, either the property owner or the commissioners of the district may, within twenty (20) days appeal to the supreme court. If the finding is in favor of the commissioners, the limits of the district shall be extended so as to embrace any lands that may be benefited by the making of the improvement. When their assessment is completed, the commissioners shall subscribe such assessment and deposit it with the clerk of the chancery court where it shall be kept and preserved as a public record; provided that, for the purpose of providing funds with which to clean out, restore, repair and rehabilitate the whole or any part of the drainage system of such district or for the purpose of cooperating with the United States or any agency thereof in such works, there may be imposed a uniform assessment on each acre of unsubdivided land lying within the district, and a uniform assessment by lot on subdivided land lying within the district, and the records required in this chapter shall show the amount of the assessment in lieu of the amount of benefits to accrue to each tract. Taxes levied hereunder are hereby declared to be taxes for maintenance purposes and shall not diminish in any manner the amount of assessed benefits in any such district which is otherwise available for the payment of any outstanding bonds of such district.The assessments provided for in this section may be made even though evidences of indebtedness have been issued or validated or both prior thereto, but the lien of the holders of any such indebtedness shall not be impaired thereby.Codes, Hemingway's 1917, § 4445; 1930, § 4463; 1942, § 4689; Laws, 1912, ch. 195; Laws, 1914, ch. 269; Laws, 1964, ch. 208; Laws, 1973, ch. 348, § 1; Laws, 1977, ch. 332, § 2; Laws, 1995, ch. 392, § 2, eff. 3/15/1995.\n\nSaid commissioners shall proceed to assess the land within the district and shall inscribe in a book the description of each tract of land, the benefit to accrue to each tract by reason of such improvement, and shall enter such assessments of benefits opposite the description, together with an estimate of what the landowner will probably have to pay on such assessment for the first year.

It shall thereupon be the duty of any said companies or owners of said lines of railway, telegraph, or telephone to send a representative to view the ground with the superintendent of construction, or other person appointed by the commissioners, and arrange the exact time at which the said work can be most conveniently done. At the time agreed upon, said railroads or owners thereof shall remove all rails, ties, stringers, and such other obstructions as may be necessary, and such owners of telegraph and telephone lines shall remove all wires, poles, and other obstructions as may be necessary, to permit the excavation of a channel or channels through its right of way.

Such penalty shall inure to the drainage district, and such damages shall inure to the person, firm, or district damaged.

All expenses of preparing such plans and estimates and costs of publication shall be paid by the board of supervisors, as the work progresses, upon proper showing by the commissioners of said district; but all expenses incurred by said subdistrict shall be repaid out of the proceeds of the first money received by the proposed subdistrict.\n\nThe clerk of the chancery court shall thereupon give notice by publication for two weeks by two insertions in some newspaper published in the county or counties in which said subdistrict will be located, calling upon all persons owning real property within said subdistrict to appear before the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, on some day fixed by said clerk not less than ten days after the last publication to show cause in favor of or against the establishing of the subdistrict. If it shall appear to the court or chancellor that the organization of the proposed subdistrict will conduce to the public benefit and to the interest of real property therein, it shall make an order upon its records establishing said subdistrict. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prohibit the formation and organization of a drainage district wholly or partly within a district already organized. A district independent of the district already organized may be organized where a part or all of the lands are not in the district already organized, provided that a third of the landowners owning a majority of the acreage or a majority of the landowners owning a third of the acreage or real property within such proposed district shall petition the chancery court of any county of such district to constitute them a drainage district under the terms of this chapter, and thereupon proceedings shall be had in all respects in conformity with this chapter for the creation of a drainage district under its terms.
