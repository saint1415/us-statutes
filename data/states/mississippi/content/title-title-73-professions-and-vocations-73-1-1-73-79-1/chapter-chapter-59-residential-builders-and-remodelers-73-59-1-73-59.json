Such charges shall be sworn to, either upon actual knowledge or upon information and belief, and shall be filed with the board.The board shall investigate all charges filed with it and, upon finding reasonable cause to believe that the charges are not frivolous, unfounded or filed in bad faith, may, in its discretion, cause a hearing to be held, at a time and place fixed by the board, regarding the charges and may compel the accused by subpoena to appear before the board to respond to such charges.The board may send a certified inspector to inspect the building or structure which is the subject of a complaint or the board may use a county certified building inspector from the county where the building or structure is located to inspect the building or structure which is the subject of a complaint. The report of the inspector shall be used in the investigation and the determination of the board. The provisions above shall only apply to hearings.No disciplinary action may be taken until the accused has been furnished both a statement of the charges against him and notice of the time and place of the hearing thereon, which shall be personally served on such accused or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known business or residence address of the accused not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. The complaining party shall be notified of the place and time of the hearing by mail to the last known business or residence address of the complaining party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for the hearing.(3)At any hearing held hereunder, the board shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance and may also require the production of books, papers, documents or other materials which may be pertinent to the proceedings.

The board is authorized for proper cause to continue or recess the hearing as may be necessary.(4)At the conclusion of the hearing, the board may either decide the issue at that time or take the case under advisement for further deliberation. The board shall render its decision not more than ninety (90) days after the close of the hearing and shall forward to the last known business or residence address of the accused, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a written statement of the decision of the board.(5)If a majority of the board finds the accused guilty of the charges filed, the board may:(a)Issue a public or private reprimand;(b)Suspend or revoke the license of the accused;(c)Order completion of an additional educational requirement prescribed by the board not to exceed two (2) hours per violation; or(d)In lieu of or in addition to any reprimand, suspension, revocation, or education requirement, assess and levy upon the guilty party a monetary penalty of not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for each violation.(6)A monetary penalty assessed and levied under this section shall be paid to the board upon the expiration of the period allowed for appeal of such penalties under this section or may be paid sooner if the guilty party elects.

If the judgment is reversed, the chancery court or chancellor shall render such order or judgment as the board ought to have rendered, and certify the same to the board; and costs shall be awarded as in other cases.Appeals may be had to the Supreme Court of the State of Mississippi as provided by law from any final action of the chancery court. The board may employ counsel to defend all such appeals, to be paid out of the funds in the State Board of Contractors Fund.On appeal, any order, judgment or action of the board revoking a certificate of responsibility or residential license shall remain in full force unless the chancery court or Supreme Court reverses such order, judgment or action of the board.The remedies provided under this chapter for any aggrieved person shall not be exclusive, but shall be cumulative of and supplemental to any other remedies which he may otherwise have in law or in equity, whether by injunction or otherwise.(12)Any political subdivision or agency of this state which receives a complaint against a residential builder or remodeler shall, in addition to exercising whatever authority such political subdivision or agency has been given over such complaint, forward the complaint to the board.(13)In addition to the reasons specified in subsection (1) of this section, the board shall be authorized to suspend the license of any licensee for being out of compliance with an order for support, as defined in Section93-11-153.
