      "text": "(1)(a)The board is authorized to investigate, either on the basis of complaints filed with it or on its own initiative, instances of suspected violations of this chapter of any nature, including, but not limited to: performing the duties of a nursing home administrator without a license; the providing of false information to the board either incident to an application for a license, incident to a hearing, or otherwise; maladministration; unethical conduct; incompetence; the conviction of a licensee of a felony; the misappropriation of funds; or of any other matter reflecting unfavorably upon the holder of a license under this chapter or an applicant therefor. On the basis of information developed during such an investigation, the board may (i) revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew any license issued by the board, (ii) deny an application for a license, or (iii) reprimand, place on probation, and/or take any other action in relation to a license, as the board may deem proper under the circumstances. Whenever the results of such an investigation are filed, the executive director of the board shall set a day for a hearing and shall notify the licensee that on the day fixed for hearing he or she may appear and show cause, if any, why his or her license should not be revoked, suspended, or other action taken in relation to his or her license. The notice shall be transmitted to the licensee by certified United States mail to the address of the licensee appearing of record with the board.(b)In cases where violations of this chapter have been substantiated, the board may assess a monetary penalty for those reasonable costs that are expended by the board in the investigation and conduct of a proceeding for licensure revocation, suspension or restriction, including, but not limited to, the cost of process service, court reporters, expert witnesses and investigations.(2)The board, upon finding and determining that any person represents himself or herself to be a nursing home administrator or performs any or all of the services, acts or duties of a nursing home administrator as defined in this chapter without a license, is authorized to petition the chancery court of the county in which the unauthorized acts have been, are being or may be committed, for writ or writs of injunction prohibiting the unauthorized acts. This provision is supplemental and in addition to the penal provisions set forth in Section73-17-13.(3)Any licensee whose license has been revoked or suspended, or who has been placed on probation or reprimanded after a contested hearing, may appeal that action of the board to the chancery court of the county in which the nursing home administrator is practicing, which appeal shall not be a de novo appeal but shall be determined upon an official transcript of the record of the contested hearing. Appeals to the chancery court shall be taken within ten (10) days from the date of the board's order and shall be taken, perfected, heard and determined either in termtime or in vacation, and the appeals shall be heard and disposed of promptly by the court. Appeals from the board shall be taken and perfected by the filing of a bond in the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) with two (2) sureties, or with a surety company qualified to do business in Mississippi as surety, conditioned to pay the costs of the appeal. The bond shall be payable to the state and shall be approved by the clerk of the chancery court. The bond may be enforced in its name as other judicial bonds filed in the chancery court, and judgment may be entered upon those bonds and process and execution shall issue upon those judgments as provided by law in other cases. Upon approval of the bond by the clerk of the chancery court, the clerk shall give notice to the board of the appeal from the decision of the board. It thereupon shall be the duty of the board through its duly authorized representative to promptly transmit to the clerk of the chancery court in which the appeal is pending a certified copy of the order of the board and all documents filed relating to the board's action against the licensee, together with a transcript of the testimony, both oral and documentary, introduced for consideration by the board both in support of and in opposition to the action, which appeal shall be docketed by the clerk and shall be determined by the court based upon the record. If there is an appeal, the appeal may, in the discretion of and on motion to the chancery court, act as a supersedeas. The chancery court shall dispose of the appeal and enter its decision promptly. The hearing on the appeal may, in the discretion of the chancellor, be tried in vacation.(4)Appeals from the decision of the chancery court may be taken by either the board or the licensee to the Supreme Court as in the case of appeals generally from the chancery court to the Supreme Court.(5)In addition to the reasons specified in subsection (1) of this section, the board shall be authorized to suspend the license of any licensee for being out of compliance with an order for support, as defined in Section93-11-153. The procedure for suspension of a license for being out of compliance with an order for support, and the procedure for the reissuance or reinstatement of a license suspended for that purpose, and the payment of any fees for the reissuance or reinstatement of a license suspended for that purpose, shall be governed by Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be. Actions taken by the board in revoking a license when required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163are not actions from which an appeal may be taken under this section. Any appeal of a license suspension that is required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163shall be taken in accordance with the appeal procedure specified in Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be, rather than the procedure specified in this section. If there is any conflict between any provision of Section93-11-157or93-11-163and any provision of this chapter, the provisions of Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be, shall control.Codes, 1942, § 8831-108; Laws, 1970, ch. 414, § 8; reenacted and amended, Laws, 1983, ch. 390, § 8; reenacted, Laws, 1991, ch. 466, § 8; Laws, 1996, ch. 507, § 44; Laws, 2011, ch. 542, § 2, eff. 7/1/2011.\n\n(1)(a)The board is authorized to investigate, either on the basis of complaints filed with it or on its own initiative, instances of suspected violations of this chapter of any nature, including, but not limited to: performing the duties of a nursing home administrator without a license; the providing of false information to the board either incident to an application for a license, incident to a hearing, or otherwise; maladministration; unethical conduct; incompetence; the conviction of a licensee of a felony; the misappropriation of funds; or of any other matter reflecting unfavorably upon the holder of a license under this chapter or an applicant therefor. On the basis of information developed during such an investigation, the board may (i) revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew any license issued by the board, (ii) deny an application for a license, or (iii) reprimand, place on probation, and/or take any other action in relation to a license, as the board may deem proper under the circumstances. Whenever the results of such an investigation are filed, the executive director of the board shall set a day for a hearing and shall notify the licensee that on the day fixed for hearing he or she may appear and show cause, if any, why his or her license should not be revoked, suspended, or other action taken in relation to his or her license. The notice shall be transmitted to the licensee by certified United States mail to the address of the licensee appearing of record with the board.(b)In cases where violations of this chapter have been substantiated, the board may assess a monetary penalty for those reasonable costs that are expended by the board in the investigation and conduct of a proceeding for licensure revocation, suspension or restriction, including, but not limited to, the cost of process service, court reporters, expert witnesses and investigations.(2)The board, upon finding and determining that any person represents himself or herself to be a nursing home administrator or performs any or all of the services, acts or duties of a nursing home administrator as defined in this chapter without a license, is authorized to petition the chancery court of the county in which the unauthorized acts have been, are being or may be committed, for writ or writs of injunction prohibiting the unauthorized acts. This provision is supplemental and in addition to the penal provisions set forth in Section73-17-13.(3)Any licensee whose license has been revoked or suspended, or who has been placed on probation or reprimanded after a contested hearing, may appeal that action of the board to the chancery court of the county in which the nursing home administrator is practicing, which appeal shall not be a de novo appeal but shall be determined upon an official transcript of the record of the contested hearing. Appeals to the chancery court shall be taken within ten (10) days from the date of the board's order and shall be taken, perfected, heard and determined either in termtime or in vacation, and the appeals shall be heard and disposed of promptly by the court. Appeals from the board shall be taken and perfected by the filing of a bond in the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) with two (2) sureties, or with a surety company qualified to do business in Mississippi as surety, conditioned to pay the costs of the appeal. The bond shall be payable to the state and shall be approved by the clerk of the chancery court. The bond may be enforced in its name as other judicial bonds filed in the chancery court, and judgment may be entered upon those bonds and process and execution shall issue upon those judgments as provided by law in other cases. Upon approval of the bond by the clerk of the chancery court, the clerk shall give notice to the board of the appeal from the decision of the board. It thereupon shall be the duty of the board through its duly authorized representative to promptly transmit to the clerk of the chancery court in which the appeal is pending a certified copy of the order of the board and all documents filed relating to the board's action against the licensee, together with a transcript of the testimony, both oral and documentary, introduced for consideration by the board both in support of and in opposition to the action, which appeal shall be docketed by the clerk and shall be determined by the court based upon the record. If there is an appeal, the appeal may, in the discretion of and on motion to the chancery court, act as a supersedeas. The chancery court shall dispose of the appeal and enter its decision promptly. The hearing on the appeal may, in the discretion of the chancellor, be tried in vacation.(4)Appeals from the decision of the chancery court may be taken by either the board or the licensee to the Supreme Court as in the case of appeals generally from the chancery court to the Supreme Court.(5)In addition to the reasons specified in subsection (1) of this section, the board shall be authorized to suspend the license of any licensee for being out of compliance with an order for support, as defined in Section93-11-153. The procedure for suspension of a license for being out of compliance with an order for support, and the procedure for the reissuance or reinstatement of a license suspended for that purpose, and the payment of any fees for the reissuance or reinstatement of a license suspended for that purpose, shall be governed by Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be. Actions taken by the board in revoking a license when required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163are not actions from which an appeal may be taken under this section. Any appeal of a license suspension that is required by Section93-11-157or93-11-163shall be taken in accordance with the appeal procedure specified in Section93-11-157or93-11-163, as the case may be, rather than the procedure specified in this section.
