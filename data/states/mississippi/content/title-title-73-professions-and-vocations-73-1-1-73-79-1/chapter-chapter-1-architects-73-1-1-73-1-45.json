If any person licensed under Sections73-1-1through73-1-43is expelled from membership in any Mississippi or national professional architectural society or association, the board shall thereafter cite such person to appear at a hearing before the board to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against that person.The board shall investigate all charges filed with it and, upon finding reasonable cause to believe that the charges are not frivolous, unfounded or filed in bad faith, may cause a hearing to be held, at a time and place fixed by the board, regarding the charges and may compel the accused by subpoena to appear before the board to respond to the charges.No disciplinary action may be taken until the accused has been furnished both a statement of the charges against him and notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof, which shall be personally served on the accused or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known business or residence address of the accused not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date of the hearing.(3)At any hearing held hereunder, the board, upon application and approval of the chancery court, shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance and may also require the production of books, papers and other documents, as provided in this chapter.
