The board shall hold regular meetings for examination beginning on the second week of January and July of each year; and may hold additional meetings at such times and places as it deems necessary, but not to exceed twelve (12) times during its initial calendar year and at least four (4) times during any subsequent calendar year but may hold meetings at such times and places as it deems necessary.

The board shall be authorized to establish educational qualifications and continuing education requirements for chiropractic assistants that participate in direct patient care. This section does not prohibit a chiropractic assistant from rendering ancillary services or procedures used in chiropractic practice, other than the adjustments or manipulative techniques, if those services are rendered under the supervision and control of a licensed chiropractor as long as the chiropractic assistant has successfully completed a training program recognized by the board. \"Supervision and control\" may not be construed as requiring the personal presence of the supervising and controlling chiropractor at the place where those services are rendered, unless physical presence is necessary to provide patient care of the same quality as provided by the chiropractor. This section does not prohibit a chiropractor from delegating to a chiropractic assistant certain activities relating to patient care and treatment when those activities are under supervision or direct order of the chiropractor. The chiropractor delegating those activities to an employee, to a program graduate, or to a participant in an approved training program is legally liable for those activities performed by such a chiropractic assistant and that chiropractic assistant is considered to be the chiropractor's agent. The board shall charge a fee not to exceed Fifty Dollars ($50.00) annually for this certification and annual renewal.
