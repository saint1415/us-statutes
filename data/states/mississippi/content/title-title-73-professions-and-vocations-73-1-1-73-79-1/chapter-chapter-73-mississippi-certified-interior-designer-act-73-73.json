The charges, which need not be sworn to, may be made upon actual knowledge, or upon information and belief, and must be filed with the board.

The board may compel, by subpoena, the accused to appear before the board to respond to the charges.No disciplinary action may be taken until the accused has been furnished with both a statement of the charges against him and notice of the time and place of the hearing on those charges, which must be served personally on the accused or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known business or residence address of the accused not less than thirty (30) days before the date fixed for the hearing.(4)At a hearing held under this section, the board may subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance and require the production of any books, papers or documents.

The accused shall have the right to present evidence and to examine and cross-examine all witnesses. The board may continue or recess the hearing as may be necessary.(5)At the conclusion of the hearing, the board may either decide the issue at the time or take the case under advisement for further deliberation. The board must render its decision not more than forty-five (45) days after the close of the hearing and shall forward to the last known business or residence address of the accused by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, a written statement of the decision of the board.If a majority of the board finds the accused guilty of the charges filed, the board may:(a)Issue a public or private reprimand;(b)Suspend or revoke the certificate of the accused, if the accused is a Mississippi Certified Interior Designer; or(c)In lieu of or in addition to such reprimand, suspension or revocation, assess and levy upon the guilty party a monetary penalty of not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for each violation.(6)A monetary penalty assessed and levied under this section must be paid to the board within thirty (30) days. Money collected by the board under this section and all fines shall be deposited into the account of the board.When payment of a monetary penalty assessed and levied by the board under this section is not paid when due, the board may institute and maintain proceedings in its name for enforcement of payment in the chancery court of the county of the residence of the guilty party. If the guilty party is a nonresident of the State of Mississippi, the proceedings must be instituted in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi.(7)When the board has taken a disciplinary action under this section, the board, in its discretion, may stay the action and place the guilty party on probation for a period not to exceed one (1) year, upon the condition that the guilty party shall not further violate either the law of the State of Mississippi pertaining to the use of the term Mississippi Certified Interior Designer or the rules and regulations or standards of conduct and ethics promulgated by IDAC and the board.(8)The board, in its discretion, may assess and tax any part of all costs of any disciplinary proceedings conducted under this section against the accused if the accused is found guilty of the charges.(9)The power and authority of the board to assess and levy the monetary penalties provided for in this section shall not be affected or diminished by any other proceedings, civil or criminal, concerning the same violation or violations except as provided in this section.(10)The board, on the recommendation of IDAC, for sufficient cause, may reissue a revoked certificate by an affirmative vote of a majority of the board members; however, a revoked certificate may not be issued within two (2) years of the revocation under any circumstances. A new certificate required to replace a revoked certificate may be issued, subject to the rules of the board, for a charge established by the rules and regulations set forth by IDAC.(11)In addition to the reasons specified in this section, the board may suspend the certificate of any person for being out of compliance with an order for support, as defined in Section93-11-153.
