If a notarial act is performed regarding an electronic record, the certificate must be affixed to, or logically associated with, the electronic record. If the Secretary of State has established standards under Section25-34-39for attaching, affixing or logically associating the certificate, the process must conform to those standards.(8)The signature of a notarial officer certifying a notarial act may not be deemed evidence to show that the notarial officer had knowledge of the contents of the record so signed, other than those specific contents which constitute the signature, execution, acknowledgment, oath, affirmation, affidavit, verification or other act which the signature of that notarial officer chronicles.Added by Laws, 2020, ch. 382, HB 1156,§ 16, eff. 7/1/2021.\n\nAdded by Laws, 2020, ch. 382, HB 1156,§ 16, eff. 7/1/2021.",
