The clerk shall give the parties or their solicitors of record not less than five (5) days' notice by letter addressed to the parties or their solicitors, advising that the matter will be heard on the day named, and on the day set for the hearing the chancellor shall hear and determine the controversy as other suits in chancery and enter a decree in accordance with his finding. The chancellor may by his final decree adjudicate the execution of any lost or destroyed or stolen instruments involved in the proceeding, and may order the final decree recorded as provided by law in other cases affecting land titles.Codes, 1892, § 2805; 1906, § 3185; Hemingway's 1917, § 2526; 1930, § 2346; 1942, § 776; Laws, 1924, ch. 242.\n\nA lost, stolen, or destroyed record shall not constitute constructive notice longer than three (3) years from the loss, theft, or destruction thereof, unless within that time the instrument shall be again placed on the record, or proceedings be begun to perfect the record. In all cases where the record of any instrument affecting the title, lien, or interest in real estate is lost or destroyed by tornado, fire, or otherwise, any person claiming to be the owner of or having a legal interest in or title to any real estate described in or affected by said lost or destroyed record may file his petition to the chancery court of the county in which the record has been lost or destroyed, setting forth a description of the land involved, with a statement of petitioner's claim and the nature thereof, the names, places of residence, and post-office addresses of all persons known to the petitioner to have or claim any interest in land by virtue of such lost or destroyed record or having a recordable instrument affecting the title to such land described in or affected by the lost or destroyed instrument or instruments, and giving in clear and succinct language petitioner's claim to or ownership of the land involved, with a prayer that summons be issued and served on all persons named as defendants, whether resident or nonresident. Upon the filing of such petition, the clerk of the chancery court shall issue summons for the defendants as in other cases in equity, returnable at a day not less than four (4) weeks nor more than eight (8) weeks from such filing, and requiring all defendants to appear and plead, answer, or demur to the petition. When the summons has been personally served upon the resident defendants not less than five (5) days before the return-day and proof of publication has been made for any nonresident defendants, as now required by law, and no one of the named defendants appears and contests the petition, then the chancery court or presiding chancellor, either in term time or vacation, may forthwith hear said petition, adjudicate the sufficiency of process, render any and all necessary decrees pro confesso and enter a final decree or decrees disposing of said petition. If any defendant appears and contests the petition, the chancery clerk shall promptly notify the chancellor of the district in writing of the pendency of said petition and the contest thereon, and the chancellor shall then notify the chancery clerk to set the matter for hearing at some future date not less than ten (10) days thereafter. The clerk shall give the parties or their solicitors of record not less than five (5) days' notice by letter addressed to the parties or their solicitors, advising that the matter will be heard on the day named, and on the day set for the hearing the chancellor shall hear and determine the controversy as other suits in chancery and enter a decree in accordance with his finding. The chancellor may by his final decree adjudicate the execution of any lost or destroyed or stolen instruments involved in the proceeding, and may order the final decree recorded as provided by law in other cases affecting land titles.\n\nCodes, 1892, § 2805; 1906, § 3185; Hemingway's 1917, § 2526; 1930, § 2346; 1942, § 776; Laws, 1924, ch. 242.",
