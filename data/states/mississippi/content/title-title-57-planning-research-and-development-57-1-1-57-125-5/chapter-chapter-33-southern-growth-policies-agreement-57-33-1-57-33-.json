In any such event, it shall be a condition precedent that satisfactory financing and personnel arrangements be concluded to assure that the party or parties benefited bear all costs which the board determines that it would be inequitable for it to assume.

During any period when a state is participating in this agreement through gubernatorial action, the governor may provide to the board an equitable share of the financial support of the board from any source available to him. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a governor to take action contrary to the Constitution or laws of his state.(d)Except for a withdrawal effective on December 31, 1973, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this article, any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one (1) year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.Article XIII.Construction and SeverabilityThis agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.Laws, 1975, ch. 400, § 1; Laws, 1980, ch. 323, eff. 7/1/1980.\n\nThe State of Mississippi shall adhere to the Southern Growth Policies Agreement by becoming a party state therein in the form substantially as follows:SOUTHERN GROWTH POLICIES AGREEMENTArticle I.Findings and Purposes(a)The party states find that the South has a sense of community based on common social, cultural and economic needs, and fostered by a regional tradition.

There are vast potentialities for mutual improvement of each state in the region by cooperative planning for the development, conservation and efficient utilization of human and natural resources in a geographic area large enough to afford a high degree of flexibility in identifying and taking maximum advantage of opportunities for healthy and beneficial growth. The independence of each state and the special needs of subregions are recognized and are to be safeguarded. Accordingly, the cooperation resulting from this agreement is intended to assist the states in meeting their own problems by enhancing their abilities to recognize and analyze regional opportunities and take account of regional influences in planning and implementing their public policies.(b)The purposes of this agreement are to provide:(1)Improve facilities and procedures for study, analysis and planning of governmental policies, programs and activities of regional significance.(2)Assistance in the prevention of interstate conflicts and the promotion of regional cooperation.(3)Mechanisms for the coordination of state and local interests on a regional basis.(4)An agency to assist the states in accomplishing the foregoing.Article II.The Board(a)There is hereby created the Southern Growth Policies Board, hereinafter called \"the board.\"(b)The board shall consist of five (5) members from each party state, as follows:(1)The governor.(2)Two (2) members of the state legislature, one (1) appointed by the presiding officer of each house of the legislature or in such other manner as the legislature may provide.(3)Two (2) residents of the state who shall be appointed by the governor to serve at his pleasure.(c)In making appointments pursuant to paragraph (b)(3), a governor shall, to the greatest extent practicable, select persons who, along with the other members serving pursuant to paragraph (b), will make the state's representation on the board broadly representative of the several socio-economic elements within his state.(d)(1)A governor may be represented by an alternate with power to act in his place and stead if notice of the designation of such alternate is given to the board in such manner as its bylaws may provide.(2)A legislative member of the board may be represented by an alternate with power to act in his place and stead unless the laws of his state prohibit such representation and if notice of the designation of such alternate is given to the board in such manner as its bylaws may provide. An alternate for a legislative member of the board shall be selected by the member from among the members of the legislative house in which he serves.(3)A member of the board serving pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this article may be represented by another resident of his state who may participate in his place and stead, except that he shall not vote, provided that notice of the identity and designation of the representative selected by the member is given to the board in such manner as its bylaws may provide.Article III.Powers(a)The board shall prepare and keep current a statement of regional objectives, including recommended approaches to regional problems. The statement may also identify projects deemed by the board to be of regional significance. The statement shall be available in its initial form two (2) years from the effective date of this agreement, and shall be amended or revised no less frequently than once every six (6) years. The statement shall be in such detail as the board may prescribe. Amendments, revisions, supplements or evaluations may be transmitted at any time. An annual commentary on the statement shall be submitted at a regular time to be determined by the board.(b)In addition to powers conferred on the board elsewhere in this agreement, the board shall have the power to make or commission studies, investigations and recommendations with respect to:(1)The planning and programming of projects of interstate or regional significance.(2)Planning and scheduling of governmental services and programs which would be of assistance to the orderly growth and prosperity of the region, and to the well-being of its population.(3)Effective utilization of such federal assistance as may be available on a regional basis or as may have an interstate or regional impact.(4)Measures for influencing population distribution, land use, development of new communities, and redevelopment of existing ones.(5)Transportation patterns and systems of interstate and regional significance.(6)Improved utilization of human and natural resources for the advancement of the region as a whole.(7)Any other matters of a planning, data collection or informational character that the board may determine to be of value to the party states.Article IV.Avoidance of Duplication(a)To avoid duplication of effort and in the interest of economy, the board shall make use of existing studies, surveys, plans and data, and other materials in the possession of the governmental agencies of the party states and their respective subdivisions or in the possession of other interstate agencies.

In addition, the board may establish advisory committees representative of subregions of the South, civic and community interests, industry, agriculture, labor, or other categories or any combinations thereof.

Each of the board's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states.(b)The total amount of appropriation requests under any budget shall be apportioned among the party states. Such apportionment shall be in accordance with the following formula:(1)One-third (1/3) in equal shares,(2)One-third (1/3) in the proportion that the population of a party state bears to the population of all party states, and(3)One-third (1/3) in the proportion that the per capita income in a party state bears to the per capita income in all party states.In implementing this formula, the board shall employ the most recent authoritative sources of information and shall specify the sources used.(c)The board shall not pledge the credit of any party state.

Except where the board makes use of funds available to it pursuant to Article VI(h), or borrows pursuant to this paragraph, the board shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same. The board may borrow against anticipated revenues for terms not to exceed two (2) years, but in any such event the credit pledged shall be that of the board and not of a party state.(d)The board shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the board shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established by its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the board shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the board.(e)The accounts of the board shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the board.(f)Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent board compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the board.Article VIII.Cooperation With the Federal Government and Other Governmental EntitiesEach party state is hereby authorized to participate in cooperative or joint planning undertakings with the federal government, and any appropriate agency or agencies thereof, or with any interstate agency or agencies.

If a study or investigation that would be of primary benefit to a given state, unit of local government, or intrastate or interstate area is proposed, and if the board finds that it is not justified in undertaking the work for its regional value as a demonstration, the board may undertake the study or investigation as a special project. In any such event, it shall be a condition precedent that satisfactory financing and personnel arrangements be concluded to assure that the party or parties benefited bear all costs which the board determines that it would be inequitable for it to assume. Prior to undertaking any study or investigation pursuant to this article as a special project, the board shall make reasonable efforts to secure the undertaking of the work by another responsible public or private entity in accordance with the policy set forth in Article IV(b).Article X.Comprehensive Land Use PlanningIf any two (2) or more contiguous party states desire to prepare a single or consolidated comprehensive land use plan, or a land use plan for any interstate area lying partly within each such state, the governors of the states involved may designate the board as their joint agency for the purpose. The board shall accept such designation and carry out such responsibility: provided that the states involved make arrangements satisfactory to the board to reimburse it or otherwise provide the resources with which the land use plan is to be prepared.

During any period when a state is participating in this agreement through gubernatorial action, the governor may provide to the board an equitable share of the financial support of the board from any source available to him. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a governor to take action contrary to the Constitution or laws of his state.(d)Except for a withdrawal effective on December 31, 1973, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this article, any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one (1) year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.
