Said declaration of taking shall contain or have annexed thereto:(i)A statement of the statutory authority under which and the public use for which said lands are taken.(ii)A description of the lands taken sufficient for the identification thereof.(iii)A statement of the estate or interest in said lands taken for said public use.(iv)A statement of the necessity of the immediate vesting of title in the authority in order to convey such property to the United States for the use in connection with the project.(v)A statement of the sum of money estimated by the authority to be due compensation for the land taken. Upon filing the declaration of taking and of the deposit in the court, to the use of the persons entitled thereto, of the amount of the estimated compensation stated in the declaration, title to such lands in fee simple absolute, or such less estate or interest therein as is specified in the declaration, shall vest in the authority, and such lands shall be deemed to be condemned and taken for the use of the authority, and the right to due compensation for the same shall vest in the persons entitled thereto; and compensation shall be ascertained and awarded in the proceeding and established by judgment therein, and the judgment shall include, as part of the due compensation awarded, interest in accordance with law on the amount finally awarded as the value of the property as of the date of taking, from such date to the date of payment; but interest shall not be allowed on so much thereof as shall have been paid into the court.

For the purposes of this chapter, the right of eminent domain shall be superior and dominant to the right of eminent domain of other public agencies and of railroad, telephone, telegraph, gas, power and other companies or corporations and shall extend to public and private lands including sixteenth section lands. The amount and character of interest in land, other property, and easements thus to be acquired shall be determined by the authority, and its determination shall be conclusive and shall not be subject to attack in the absence of manifest abuse of discretion or fraud on the part of the authority in making such determination. However,(i)In acquiring lands by condemnation, the authority shall not acquire minerals or royalties in minerals unless a competent registered professional engineer shall have certified that the acquisition of such minerals and royalties in minerals is necessary for purposes of the project; provided that limestone, clay, chalk, sand and gravel shall not be considered as minerals within the meaning of this section; and(ii)Unless minerals or royalties in minerals have been acquired by condemnation or otherwise, no person or persons owning the drilling rights or the right to share in production of minerals shall be prevented from exploring, developing, or producing oil or gas with necessary rights-of-way for ingress and egress, pipelines and other means of transporting interests on any land or interest therein of the authority held or used for the purposes of this chapter; but any such activities shall be under such reasonable regulation by the authority as will adequately protect the project contemplated by this chapter as provided in subparagraph (s) of this section.

Any contract between a public agency or political subdivision entered into with the authority pursuant to any of the powers granted by this chapter shall be binding upon said public agency or political subdivision according to its terms, and such public agency or political subdivision shall have the power to enter into such contracts as in the discretion of the governing authorities thereof would be to the best interest of the people of such public agency or political subdivision.
