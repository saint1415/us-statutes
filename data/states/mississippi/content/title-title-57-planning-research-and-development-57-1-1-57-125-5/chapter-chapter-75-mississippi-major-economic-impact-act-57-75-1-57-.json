Such contracts may include within the discretion of such governing authorities of public agencies defined under Section57-75-5(h)(ii)a pledge of the full faith and credit of such public agency or any other lawfully available funds for the performance thereof.

The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days before the date fixed in such resolution for the authorization of the loan and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days before such date.

The authority may carry out the provisions of this section and exercise all of the rights and other applicable laws of this state.(d)This section shall be deemed to provide an additional, alternative and complete method for the doing of the things authorized by this section and shall be deemed and construed to be supplemental to any power conferred by other laws on public agencies and not in derogation of any such powers.
