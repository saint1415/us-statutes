A \"high-growth oriented business\" is a corporation, general partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, trust, proprietorship, or other similar entity or organization which is expected to experience significant sales growth over the subsequent five-year period. All investments made from investment monies raised by the fund, for which the tax credit provided by this chapter is allowed and for which the tax credit is made available by the fund in the prospectus or offering, must be made to provide venture capital to Mississippi businesses, this venture capital to be used primarily for the purpose of enhancing the production capacity of these businesses or their ability to do business in Mississippi. Seventy percent (70%) of these investment monies acquired by the fund for which the tax credit is allowed and available must be invested to provide venture capital financing of start-up businesses. The remaining thirty percent (30%) may be invested as the general partner of the fund determines to provide capital to Mississippi businesses.(6)(a)No business may be transacted or indebtedness incurred (not including indebtedness authorized to be incurred in Sections57-77-15and57-77-17) except that as is incidental to the organization of the Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation or of the fund or to obtaining subscriptions to or payment for qualified interests, until consideration of Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000.00) has been paid as a capital investment by a private investor or private investors to Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation or to the fund. It is the intent of the Legislature that the Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation and/or the fund shall always maintain a capital investment from a private investor or private investors of at least Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000.00). If the Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation and/or the fund fail to obtain a capital investment from a private investor or private investors of at least Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000.00), or if after having obtained such investment, the total of the private capital investments ever falls below Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000.00), Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation and the fund shall suspend making investments and incurring indebtedness, and, if so directed by Magnolia Capital Corporation, the board of directors of Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation shall dissolve Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation and the fund in the manner provided by law and direct that all sums, causes of action and other assets held by the Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation and the fund be paid and/or assigned to the State Treasurer who shall administer such sums and other assets as provided by law.(b)If directed by Magnolia Capital Corporation pursuant to Section57-77-9(5), the board of directors of Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation shall dissolve Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation and the fund in the manner provided by law and direct that all sums, causes of action and other assets held by the Magnolia Venture Capital Corporation and the fund be paid and/or assigned to the State Treasurer who shall administer such sums and other assets as provided by law.(7)All securities issued by either the Mississippi Venture Capital Corporation or the fund shall be exempt securities with regard to the Mississippi Uniform Securities Act.Laws, 1994, ch. 650, § 7; Laws, 1998, ch. 563, § 5, eff. 4/17/1998.\n\nLaws, 1994, ch. 650, § 7; Laws, 1998, ch. 563, § 5, eff. 4/17/1998.",
