If the chancellor is satisfied with the final report of the receiver, he shall, by order entered on the minutes of the court, direct that the clerk of the court cause a notice to be run in a newspaper published in the county wherein the receivership is pending, or if none is so published, in some newspaper having a general circulation therein, which notice shall state that the liquidation of the bank has been completed and that the final report of the receiver and petition for his discharge are on file; that unless written objection is filed with the clerk of the court within thirty days from the date of the first publication of the notice, all persons shall be forever precluded from filing any claim against the bank or the receiver, and from questioning any of the acts of the receiver, except for fraud. Said notice shall be published once a week until the expiration of said thirty day period.(3)Should the receiver have dividends on hand belonging to depositors, creditors, stockholders or others which have not been distributed the notice hereinabove referred to shall specify this fact, and shall give the name of each party who is entitled to such dividend, but it shall not be necessary to give the amount thereof. The notice shall direct that said parties call for said dividends prior to the day set for the filing of written objections, otherwise, their claim thereto shall be forfeited. On the day of the final hearing if there are dividends on hand which have not been called for, the receiver shall not be discharged, but the chancellor, by order entered on the minutes of the court, shall direct the receiver to make distribution of such unclaimed dividends to the known depositors and creditors pro rata.

If there are dividends on hand, the chancellor shall direct their distribution as above provided. Should written objections be filed to the discharge of the receiver within the time above provided, the chancellor shall set the matter for hearing in vacation or in term time as he may deem proper, and the same shall be proceeded with as any other action in chancery. In no event shall anyone be permitted to file an objection after the time specified in the notice above provided for.(5)Should there be any dividends to stockholders not called for at the expiration of thirty days from the date the chancellor orders the distribution as above provided in subsection 3 of this section, the receiver shall pay the same and all amounts due to depositors and creditors who have not called for payment, to the state comptroller, who shall hold the same for the parties entitled thereto hereunder for a period of at least one year from the date of its receipt by him, and notice shall be given as hereinafter provided.(6)Where any depositors' liquidating corporation has not paid its depositors in full, and has realized everything possible from its assets, but still has on hand insufficient money to make a distribution to its creditors, the chancery court creating such corporation may, upon finding such facts, dissolve such liquidating corporation and discharge its directors and their sureties, and make such orders with respect to the cash on hand as may appear equitable and proper, after an application for a dissolution of said corporation, accompanied by a final report of the administration thereof from the date of the creation of said corporation, has been on file with the clerk of said court not less than thirty days, and notice of the filing thereof has been given by inserting one notice in a newspaper published in the county wherein the receivership is pending not less than ten days before the date set for the hearing thereof.(7)Nothing contained in this section shall apply to any bank heretofore or hereafter liquidated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Codes, 1942, § 5257; Laws, 1934, ch. 146; Laws, 1938, Ex. ch. 52.\n\nCodes, 1942, § 5257; Laws, 1934, ch. 146; Laws, 1938, Ex. ch. 52.",

In case the state comptroller shall be in doubt as to the person or amount, he may file in regard thereto a bill of interpleader and thereupon be finally discharged, paying from such amount so deposited in court, the requisite costs for filing such bill.Within one year after receipt of any amount from a receiver, the state comptroller shall give notice of unclaimed amounts by publication in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county where such banking corporation was domiciled, once a week for three consecutive weeks, notifying such unpaid persons to come forward and claim the amounts due, and in said notice stating the amount of money received, the name of the party who is entitled to any portion thereof according to the books of the bank, but without specifying the amount, and shall command said parties to call for such amounts prior to the date fixed for payment to the state treasurer, and stating that unless they shall do so, the amounts will be paid over to the state treasurer in trust on or after a day therein to be named. After the expiration of said time, the state comptroller shall pay over such amounts held by him to the state treasurer, less any publication or other costs incurred in connection therewith and give to the state treasurer a list of all persons entitled to any amount together, if possible, with the amount thereof and the residence, if possible, of such person. Thereupon the state treasurer shall be required to place the amount so paid over to him in a special trust fund in the state treasury for the benefit of any and all persons rightfully entitled thereto, and thereafter when said funds are so paid over, there shall be no further liability on the bank, its receiver, the state comptroller, his bond or any other agent or employee, for any amount so thus paid over to the state treasurer under this section. Persons rightfully entitled to any such amounts so paid over into this trust fund shall be paid the amount thereof direct from such trust fund by the state treasurer without specific appropriation therefor, such payment to be made by the state treasurer upon requisition drawn by the state comptroller on the written approval of the attorney general. The state comptroller and the state treasurer shall have power to pay from such amount on hand the cost of any publication and other expense items properly incurred chargeable thereto, which amounts shall be deducted from the amount to be paid over. The state comptroller or the state treasurer may apply the interest earned by the money so held by either of them, if any, towards defraying the expenses of the payment and the distribution to the persons entitled.(c)After the expiration of fifteen (15) years from the date of the receipt of such amount by the state treasurer, the deposits and amounts then unclaimed shall be placed by the state treasurer in the general fund of the State of Mississippi, and such fund shall belong to the State of Mississippi, free from the claims of all persons whatsoever.(d)The delivery of such assets to such agent of said bank, selected as aforesaid, and the discharge of such receiver shall not release, discharge or affect any right, claim or action which any creditor or claimant consenting to such transfer and discharge might then or thereafter have against said bank, or the stockholders of the bank on account of their double liability, if any, if the assets of the bank are insufficient to pay said creditors' or claimants' claims in full, with interest, if any is due; it being the intention hereof that the liability of the bank and its stockholders, if any, shall not be affected or released by the discharge of the receiver. The court having jurisdiction of the receivership shall retain jurisdiction over any suit, petition or proceeding brought pursuant hereto, and especially involving a contested claim for depositor or creditor, and such suit, or suits, may be as fully and completely determined and adjudicated by said court as if had under the receivership.(e)Such agent or agents under the direction of the board of directors of said bank shall convert the assets coming into his or their possession into cash, if so directed, and after paying all taxes and any and all unpaid claims, lawfully established, and the expenses of said liquidation, shall distribute the assets in cash or kind pro rata among the stockholders of the bank in proportion to the stock held by each and every stockholder. Such bank may from time to time hold meetings of its stockholders in accordance with its by-laws for the election of boards of directors and such other corporate business as may properly come before the meeting looking towards its liquidation, and such directors may, from time to time, replace such agent or agents in charge of such liquidation, paying such agent or agents such compensation as they may determine. All expenses of such liquidation by such agent or agents shall be subject to approval by the board of directors of the bank.(f)Prior to or contemporaneously with the delivery of said assets to the agent or agents of said bank, it shall be a condition thereto that all persons having a direct lien on the assets of the trust and also all persons having an undisposed of disputed claim, if any there be, pending in the receivership, be required to give their consent in writing to the release of the assets in the hands of the receiver to the bank. When the court is satisfied of compliance with all requirements hereinbefore contained, a decree shall be entered which shall have the effect (1) to discharge the receiver and his surety from all liability to all persons; (2) to revest title to all assets withheld by the receiver in the old banking corporation and to vest such corporation with full authority to receive and deal with such property for purposes only of effective liquidation.Codes, 1942, §§ 5258, 5259; Laws, 1938, Ex. ch. 52.\n\nAny bank found to be solvent may be liquidated, if desired by the bank, in accordance with this section.\n\nIt is the purpose of this section to require that the claims of all depositors and creditors as reflected by the books of the bank, be paid, whether proven or not, provided they are called for within the period stipulated in this section. The bank shall continue as a corporation until that authorized hereunder to be done has been accomplished whereafter its charter shall be surrendered as provided by law.\n\nWithin one year after receipt of any amount from a receiver, the state comptroller shall give notice of unclaimed amounts by publication in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county where such banking corporation was domiciled, once a week for three consecutive weeks, notifying such unpaid persons to come forward and claim the amounts due, and in said notice stating the amount of money received, the name of the party who is entitled to any portion thereof according to the books of the bank, but without specifying the amount, and shall command said parties to call for such amounts prior to the date fixed for payment to the state treasurer, and stating that unless they shall do so, the amounts will be paid over to the state treasurer in trust on or after a day therein to be named. After the expiration of said time, the state comptroller shall pay over such amounts held by him to the state treasurer, less any publication or other costs incurred in connection therewith and give to the state treasurer a list of all persons entitled to any amount together, if possible, with the amount thereof and the residence, if possible, of such person. Thereupon the state treasurer shall be required to place the amount so paid over to him in a special trust fund in the state treasury for the benefit of any and all persons rightfully entitled thereto, and thereafter when said funds are so paid over, there shall be no further liability on the bank, its receiver, the state comptroller, his bond or any other agent or employee, for any amount so thus paid over to the state treasurer under this section. Persons rightfully entitled to any such amounts so paid over into this trust fund shall be paid the amount thereof direct from such trust fund by the state treasurer without specific appropriation therefor, such payment to be made by the state treasurer upon requisition drawn by the state comptroller on the written approval of the attorney general. The state comptroller and the state treasurer shall have power to pay from such amount on hand the cost of any publication and other expense items properly incurred chargeable thereto, which amounts shall be deducted from the amount to be paid over. The state comptroller or the state treasurer may apply the interest earned by the money so held by either of them, if any, towards defraying the expenses of the payment and the distribution to the persons entitled.\n\nCodes, 1942, §§ 5258, 5259; Laws, 1938, Ex. ch. 52.",

Said notice shall be published once a week for four successive weeks.(3)Should the directors have dividends on hand belonging to the depositors, creditors, stockholders or others which have not been distributed, the notice hereinabove referred to shall specify this fact, and shall give the name of each party who is entitled to such dividend, but it shall not be necessary to give the amount thereof. The notice shall direct that said parties call for said dividends prior to the day set for the filing of written objections, otherwise their claim thereto shall be forfeited. On the day of the final hearing if there are dividends on hand which have not been called for, the directors shall not be discharged, or the corporation dissolved, but the chancellor by order entered on the minutes of the court shall direct the directors to make distribution of such unclaimed dividends to the known depositors and creditors pro rata; provided, that in the event the known depositors and creditors have already been paid in full, such unclaimed dividends shall be distributed to the stockholders pro rata.(4)If on the day of the final hearing there are no dividends on hand for distribution and there have been no objections filed to the discharge of the directors and the dissolution of the corporation, the chancellor shall enter an order granting the discharge of the directors and a dissolution of the corporation. If there are dividends on hand, the chancellor shall direct their distribution as above provided. Should written objections be filed to the discharge of the directors and the dissolution of the corporation within the time above provided, the chancellor shall set the matter for hearing in vacation or term time as he may deem proper, and the same shall be proceeded with as any other action in chancery. In no event shall anyone be permitted to file objections after the time specified in the notice above provided for.(5)Should there be any dividends not called for at the expiration of forty-five (45) days from the date the chancellor orders the distribution as provided in subsection (3) hereof, the directors shall pay the same to the state comptroller who shall hold the same for parties entitled thereto for a period of one year from the date of the order of the chancellor directing the distribution. If said funds are not called for before the expiration of said period, the owners shall lose all right thereto, and the state comptroller shall pay the same, or so much thereof as remains in his hands, into the state treasury. Upon the directors making the distribution provided for in subsection (3) hereof, either by paying said funds to the parties entitled thereto, or by paying the same or a part thereof to the state comptroller, they shall report such fact to the chancellor, who shall enter his decree granting the discharge of the directors and the dissolution of the corporation, and the court or chancellor in vacation, shall have the power and authority during the course of proceedings under this section to make all such orders as he may deem right and proper to fully carry out the purposes of this section.(6)When the final decree of the discharge and dissolution is entered by the court or chancellor in vacation, it shall be the duty of the clerk to immediately turn over to the state comptroller all the books of the corporation which have been filed with said cause and take a receipt from said comptroller therefor and file said receipt with the papers in said cause. It shall be the duty of the state comptroller to receive said books, and receipt therefor and to file and preserve the same in his office as other bank records.Codes, 1942, § 5276; Laws, 1934, ch. 146; Laws, 1942, ch. 264.\n\nCodes, 1942, § 5276; Laws, 1934, ch. 146; Laws, 1942, ch. 264.",
