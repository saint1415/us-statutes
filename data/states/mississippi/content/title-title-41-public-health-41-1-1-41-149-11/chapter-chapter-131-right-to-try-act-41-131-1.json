The drug, product or device must be produced in a manner consistent with the quality standards of an adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device in the United States (i.e., standards required by an FDA-approved trial) and must show prior evidence of safe usage in humans in the United States or other countries. The adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device must have successfully completed phase one of a clinical trial but has not been approved for general use by the United States Food and Drug Administration and remains under investigation in a clinical trial. The term shall not include Schedule I controlled substances.(c)\"Terminal illness\" means a disease that without life-sustaining procedures will result in death in the near future or a state of permanent unconsciousness from which recovery is unlikely.(d)\"Written informed consent\" means a written document that is:(i)Signed by the:1.Patient;2.Parent, if the patient is a minor;3.Legal guardian; or4.Patient advocate designated by the patient under the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act, Section41-41-201et seq.; and(ii)Attested to by the patient's physician and a witness and that, at a minimum, includes all of the following:1.An explanation of the currently approved products and treatments for the disease or condition from which the patient suffers;2.An attestation that the patient concurs with his or her physician in believing that all currently approved and conventionally recognized treatments are unlikely to prolong the patient's life;3.Clear identification of the specific proposed adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device that the patient is seeking to use;4.A description of the potentially best and worst outcomes of using the adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device and a realistic description of the most likely outcome. The description shall include the possibility that new, unanticipated, different, or worse symptoms might result and that death could be hastened by the proposed treatment. The description shall be based on the physician's knowledge of the proposed treatment in conjunction with an awareness of the patient's condition;5.A statement that the patient's health plan or third-party administrator and provider are not obligated or required to pay for any cost of any adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device or for any care or treatments consequent to the use of the adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device, unless they are specifically required to do so by law or contract;6.A statement that the patient's eligibility for hospice care may be withdrawn if the patient begins curative treatment with the adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device and that care may be reinstated if this treatment ends and the patient meets hospice eligibility requirements; and7.A statement that the patient understands that he or she is liable for all expenses consequent to the use of the adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device and that this liability extends to the patient's estate, unless a contract between the patient and the manufacturer of the adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, drug, biological product or device states otherwise. The patient's health plan or third-party administrator are not liable for any outstanding debt related to the treatment or lack of insurance consequent to the use of the adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device.(3)A manufacturer of an adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device may make available the manufacturer's adult autologous mesenchymal stem cell, investigational drug, biological product or device to eligible patients under this section.
