Tobacco use also is a large burden on the families and businesses of Mississippi. It is therefore the intent of the Legislature that there be developed, implemented and fully funded a comprehensive and statewide tobacco education, prevention and cessation program that is consistent with the Best Practices for Tobacco Control Programs of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as periodically amended. It is also the intent of the Legislature that all reasonable efforts be made to maximize the amount of federal funds available for this program.(2)The goals of the tobacco education, prevention and cessation program include, but are not limited to, the following:(a)Preventing the initiation of use of tobacco products by youth;(b)Encouraging and helping smokers to quit and reducing the numbers of youth and adults who use tobacco products;(c)Assisting in the protection from secondhand smoke;(d)Supporting the enforcement of laws prohibiting youth access to tobacco products;(e)Eliminating the racial and cultural disparities related to use of tobacco products; and(f)Educating the public and changing the cultural perception of use of tobacco products in Mississippi.Laws, 2007, ch. 514, § 13, eff. 3/30/2007.\n\n(1)The Mississippi Legislature recognizes the devastating impact that tobacco use has on the citizens of our state.
