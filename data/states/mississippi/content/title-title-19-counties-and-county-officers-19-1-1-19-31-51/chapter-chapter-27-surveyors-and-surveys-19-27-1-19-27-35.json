When such map or plat shall conform, or shall be made to conform, to the requirements of law, the clerk and the engineer, surveyor, or other person who made the same, shall carefully compare the duplicate with the map or plat, and, if correct, or when made correct, it shall be certified by the clerk and the engineer, surveyor, or other maker, stating therein that they have carefully compared the same with the map or plat (describing it), and that it is an exact duplicate thereof, and of the whole of such map or plat. The clerk shall then securely fasten the said duplicate in a book of the proper size for such paper, so that it shall not be folded, which book shall be securely bound and provided at the costs of the county, after the first map or plat is so presented. Such duplicate so fastened in said book shall be held and taken to be a record of the map or plat, with like effect as if the map or plat had been actually transcribed by the clerk in a book in his office. The clerk shall certify on the map or plat and note on the duplicate the time when it was recorded, and make a reference on the map to the book and page where recorded. The lines and distances of all such maps or plats shall be in yards, feet, and inches.\n\nCodes, 1892, § 4402; 1906, § 4967; Hemingway's 1917, § 7750; 1930, § 7152; 1942, § 4281.",
