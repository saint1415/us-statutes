The result of this formula shall be assessed against each lot or parcel of land for the owner's part of the cost of the entire improvement to be paid through special assessments.Laws, 1999, ch. 566, § 18, eff. 4/21/1999.\n\nThe resolution declaring the intent of the board of commissioners to proceed with the special improvement projects of the district may direct that all of the expenses of the property, structures or facilities of the district, or the part of the expenses that the board of commissioners shall charge upon the property in the district shall be assessed according to the frontage rule or area rule, as outlined in this section. Bonds may be issued for one or more projects, and the area and method of assessment for each project shall be specified in the resolution declaring the intent of the board of commissioners of the district to proceed with that project.
