The State Treasurer shall provide for custody of the bonds or obligations or certificates of deposits by a qualified trust company or bank located in the State of Mississippi or by any Federal Reserve Bank. The compensation, if any, of the custodian for acting as such under this section shall be paid by the depositing licensee.(d)Proof of registration as a money service business per 31 CFR Section 103.41, if applicable.(e)A set of fingerprints from any local law enforcement agency for each owner of a sole proprietorship, partners in a partnership or principal owners of a limited liability company that own at least ten percent (10%) of the voting shares of the company, shareholders owning ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding shares of the corporation, except publically traded corporations and their subsidiaries, and any other executive officer with significant oversight duties of the business. In order to determine the applicant's suitability for license, the commissioner shall forward the fingerprints to the Department of Public Safety for a state criminal history records check, and the fingerprints shall be forwarded by the Department of Public Safety to the FBI for a national criminal history records check. The department shall not issue a license if it finds that the applicant, or any person who is an owner, partner, director or executive officer of the applicant, has been convicted of:(i)a felony in any jurisdiction; or(ii)a crime that, if committed within the state, would constitute a felony under the laws of this state; or(iii)a misdemeanor of fraud, theft, forgery, bribery, embezzlement or making a fraudulent or false statement in any jurisdiction. For the purposes of this chapter, a person shall be deemed to have been convicted of a crime if the person has pleaded guilty to a crime before a court or federal magistrate, or plea of nolo contendere, or has been found guilty of a crime by the decision or judgment of a court or federal magistrate or by the verdict of a jury, irrespective of the pronouncement of sentence or the suspension of a sentence, unless the person convicted of the crime has received a pardon from the President of the United States or the Governor or other pardoning authority in the jurisdiction where the conviction was obtained.Codes, 1942, § 5131-06; Laws, 1966, ch. 257, § 6; Laws, 1995, ch. 373, § 2; Laws, 2010, ch. 448, § 6, eff. 7/1/2010.\n\nEach application for a license shall be accompanied by:(a)Certified financial statements, reasonably satisfactory to the commissioner, showing that the applicant has a net worth of at least Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) plus Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) for each location in excess of one (1) at which the applicant proposes to conduct money transmissions in this state, computed according to generally accepted accounting principles, but in no event shall the net worth be required to be in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00).(b)A surety bond issued by a bonding company or insurance company authorized to do business in this state, in the principal sum of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) or in an amount equal to outstanding money transmissions in Mississippi, whichever is greater, but in no event shall the bond be required to be in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00). However, the commissioner may increase the required amount of the bond upon the basis of the impaired financial condition of a licensee as evidenced by a reduction in net worth, financial losses or other relevant criteria. The bond shall be in form satisfactory to the commissioner and shall run to the state for the use and benefit of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance and any claimants against the applicant or his agents to secure the faithful performance of the obligations of the applicant and his agents with respect to the receipt, handling, transmission and payment of money in connection with money transmissions in Mississippi. The aggregate liability of the surety in no event shall exceed the principal sum of the bond. The surety on the bond shall have the right to cancel the bond upon giving sixty (60) days' notice in writing to the commissioner and thereafter shall be relieved of liability for any breach of condition occurring after the effective date of the cancellation. Any claimants against the applicant or his agents may themselves bring suit directly on the bond, or the Attorney General may bring suit thereon in behalf of those claimants, either in one (1) action or successive actions.(c)In lieu of the corporate surety bond, the applicant may deposit with the State Treasurer bonds or other obligations of the United States or guaranteed by the United States or bonds or other obligations of this state or of any municipal corporation, county, or other political subdivision or agency of this state, or certificates of deposit of national or state banks doing business in Mississippi, having an aggregate market value at least equal to that of the corporate surety bond otherwise required.
