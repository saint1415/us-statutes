Provided further, that blending pumps from which gasoline and lubricating oil are dispensed at the same time into a fuel tank or other container as marine fuel, may be installed by a distributor upon the prior issuance of a permit so to do by the commissioner or his successor, when said pumps shall have been approved by the Underwriter's Laboratories, Inc. Provided further, that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the manufacture of alcohol blended fuel.\n\nBlending of grades of gasoline, additives, and compounds shall be limited to refineries, terminals, and blending pumps, and no person other than those employed at aforesaid facilities shall be permitted to blend any of the above-named products.
