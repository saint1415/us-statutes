The use of the electric cooperative's electric delivery system for the provision of broadband services by the affiliate or other broadband operator shall not be considered an additional burden on the real property upon which the electric cooperative's electric delivery system is located and shall not require the affiliate or other broadband operator to obtain the consent of anyone having an interest in the real property upon which the electric cooperative's electric delivery system is located.(2)If a portion of an electric cooperative's electric delivery system is used by an affiliate or other broadband operator for the provision of broadband services and the landowner of the real property on which such portion is located believes his property has been damaged by such use, the landowner may petition the circuit court of the county in which the property is situated for any damages to which the landowner may be entitled under this subsection.(a)The petition allowed and damages recoverable under this subsection (2) shall be the landowner's exclusive remedy, and the landowner shall not be entitled to assert any other theory, claims or causes of action nor recover any other damages, punitive damages, costs, attorneys' fees, or other relief.(b)The recoverable damages, if any, shall be recoverable only from the affiliate or other broadband operator and not from the electric cooperative.(c)The damages recoverable shall be an amount equal to the difference between (i) the fair market value of the landowner's interest in the real property immediately before the electric cooperative's electric delivery system on the owner's property was first used by an affiliate or other broadband operator for the provision of broadband services, and (ii) the fair market value of the landowner's interest in the real property immediately after the electric cooperative's electric delivery system on the landowner's property was first used by an affiliate or other broadband operator for the provision of broadband services. The before and after values must be established by the testimony of a qualified real estate appraiser. The damages, if any, shall be fixed and shall not be deemed to continue, accumulate, or accrue. The court shall as part of its judgment vest a permanent easement in favor of the affiliate or other broadband operator and their respective successors and assigns for the placement or use of a broadband system on or as part of the electric delivery system. The judgment will have the same effect of a conveyance executed in due form of law and shall run with the land; and a certified copy of said judgment may be filed by the affiliate or other broadband operator in the land records of the county in which the subject property is located.(d)Evidence of past, current or future revenues or profits derived or to be derived by an affiliate or other broadband operator from providing broadband services is not admissible for any purpose in any such proceeding.(e)The landowner shall not be entitled to any damages or other relief relating to any broadband system or portion thereof that is located on the landowner's property and is used or could be used by the electric cooperative for its own operations.(f)The landowner shall not be entitled to any relief or damages if an easement has been granted to the affiliate or other broadband operator or if the landowner has, either directly or through his membership in the electric cooperative, authorized the electric cooperative to use or allow others to use its electric delivery system for the provision of broadband services.Added by Laws, 2019, ch. 301, HB 366,§ 6, eff. 1/30/2019.\n\nAdded by Laws, 2019, ch. 301, HB 366,§ 6, eff. 1/30/2019.",
