      "text": "The purpose of this chapter is to eradicate and prevent the spread of contagious and infectious diseases of swine in the State of Mississippi through preventative methods based upon recommendations of leading veterinary medical authorities and animal disease research scientists to the effect that raw garbage keeps causative virus alive and the feeding of such garbage causes the spread of several contagious, infectious and deadly diseases of swine. Chief among these is hog cholera which is known to be spread among swine through the feeding of raw garbage. Trichinella infection in human population, foot and mouth disease, swine erysipelas, African swine fever, tuberculosis, brucellosis and other human and animal diseases have been associated with the feeding of garbage to swine. Since the production of swine is of great economic importance not only to the farmers of Mississippi but to the general economy of the state, it is deemed for the best interest and advancement of the agricultural economy and the general welfare of the State of Mississippi to prohibit the commercial feeding of garbage to swine from and after July 1, 1972.Codes, 1942, § 4575-201; Laws, 1970, ch. 264, § 1, eff. 7/1/1970.\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to eradicate and prevent the spread of contagious and infectious diseases of swine in the State of Mississippi through preventative methods based upon recommendations of leading veterinary medical authorities and animal disease research scientists to the effect that raw garbage keeps causative virus alive and the feeding of such garbage causes the spread of several contagious, infectious and deadly diseases of swine.
