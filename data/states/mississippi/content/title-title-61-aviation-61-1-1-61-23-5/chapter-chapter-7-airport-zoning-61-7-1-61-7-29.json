The findings of fact of the board, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be accepted by the court as conclusive. No objection to a decision of the board shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the board, or, if it was not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.\n\nCost shall not be allowed against the board of adjustment unless it appears to the court that it acted with gross negligence, in bad faith, or with malice, in making the decision appealed from.\n\nIn any case in which airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter, although generally reasonable, are held by a court to interfere with the use or enjoyment of a particular structure or parcel of land to such an extent, or to be so onerous in their application to such a structure or parcel of land, as to constitute a taking or deprivation of that property in violation of the constitution of this state or the Constitution of the United States, such holding shall not affect the application of such regulations to other structures and parcels of land.\n\nCodes, 1942, § 7544-11; Laws, 1950, ch. 284, § 11, eff. 3/21/1950.",
