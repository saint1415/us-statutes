      "text": "(1)The board may acquire for sale to a veteran a home situated in the State of Mississippi, provided that the cost of such home to the board does not exceed the maximum loan limit as provided in 38 USCS Section 3703 by application of the housing loan guaranty for housing loans to veterans as defined in 38 USCS Section 3701. A veteran purchasing such home may advance a sum of money on the purchase price of the home. In addition to the home acquisition, the board may also provide the funds for any funding fee charged by the Department of Veterans Affairs for any loan contract underwritten or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs even if the home acquisition cost and the funding fee together exceed the maximum loan amount.Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the acquisition for sale to a veteran by the Veterans' Home Purchase Board of the State of Mississippi of a home, the title to which has, prior to the date of such purchase, been vested in such veteran if title thereto is vested in such veteran due to (a) the veteran previously owning the land and the purpose of the application is to finance a home on the land; (b) the veteran having taken title to the land for the purpose of obtaining construction financing or otherwise constructing or making a major renovation of a home on the land; or (c) the veteran having previously taken title to the land and home under a nonpermanent purchase money lien to secure his ability to purchase the property while awaiting processing, approval and closing of his application with the board.The proceeds of the purchase approved may be applied toward the liquidation of a purchase money lien, contractor's or materialman's lien, or temporary construction loan outstanding against the property if the board should determine that the indebtedness secured by such liens or loan is not adequately financed on a permanent basis.(2)The limit provided above on the cost of property to the board may be exceeded in the case of a veteran who has been certified for the purchase of a home under Public Law No. 782 of the 80th Congress, by Public Law No. 286 of the 81st Congress, and other amendments thereto, which provides special benefits to veterans who have lost the use of both legs. In such cases where the federal government donates half of the cost of a dwelling for such a disabled veteran, as provided by Public Law No. 286, and, further, where the Department of Veterans Affairs guarantees half of the remainder of the purchase price, the board may increase the amount of money to be advanced for such a purchase to the maximum loan limits, as provided above.(3)Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, the board shall not consider an application to refinance a home with adequate permanent financing with a lending institution, individual or other entity, or the refinancing of the veteran's equity in a home to which he has title. The board will consider, on a case-by-case basis, the adequacy of financing when a veteran has title to the property and financing with variable rates, terms or payments where the board can ascertain that the loan was made with temporary intent on either the part of the veteran or lender, or where the veteran is in jeopardy of losing the financing due to no fault of his own. In such cases, the board shall ascertain that the present lender has no objection to the early payoff of the loan and that the veteran has not obtained and continued any form of temporary financing for the purpose of waiting for financing by the board when he could have previously obtained adequate, permanent financing.(4)The board shall not consider applications for purchase that would provide the veteran with a second home, or provide funds to be used either directly or indirectly for investment purposes. The veteran must divest himself of any personal residence before being eligible to close the board purchase on a new property. Divestment may be accomplished by sale which transfers title to another individual, or by an irrevocable lease/purchase contract, or land contract where title passes after the prescribed payment. This requirement that the veteran divest himself may be waived by the board in cases where the board can ascertain that the ownership of such property was originally intended as a temporary residence or a condominium or mobile home, or that the veteran's present residence is inadequate for his needs; and in cases where the requirement to sell on short notice will cause a financial hardship or loss to the veteran in the market place; and in cases where the sale of the present residence is not necessary to free the veteran of obligations to qualify financially for the new loan. When such waiver is granted, the veteran must agree in writing (a) not to reside in the former residence for a period of ten (10) years, (b) that the rent proceeds in excess of mortgage payments and cash expenses on the old home will be paid to the board as a reduction to the loan balance on the new home, and (c) that, at the sale of the old home within a period of ten (10) years, a full disclosure of the sale shall be made to the board and proceeds of the sale in excess of mortgage payoff and actual cost of the sale will be paid to the board as a reduction to the balance of the existing loan with the board.(5)The board may provide for the refinancing of permanent mortgage loans under the following conditions:(a)Funds are available to the board from the issuance of its notes or bonds in amounts in excess of the funds required for applicants on a waiting list for their first loan from the board.(b)The veteran has an outstanding mortgage or mortgages on the property to be refinanced.(c)The terms and conditions of the refinance loan complies with the Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan program guidelines for refinance.(d)The refinance loan shall be limited to the payoff of existing mortgages plus the closing costs of the transaction and further limited to eighty percent (80%) of the property value or amount of the Department of Veterans Affairs guaranty available on the refinance loan.(e)The board may establish interest rates, terms and conditions on refinance loans which may differ from original loans made by the board.Codes, 1942, § 7520; Laws, 1936, ch. 199; Laws, 1946, ch. 221, § 7; Laws, 1948 ch. 493, § 1 ch. 500, § 7, 1950, ch. 465, § 7; Laws, 1956, ch. 352, § 1; Laws, 1958, ch. 460, § 3; Laws, 1962, ch. 478, § 1; Laws, 1964, ch. 479; Laws, 1968, ch. 481, § 1; Laws, 1974, ch. 404, § 1; Laws, 1979, ch. 313, § 1; Laws, 1985, ch. 501, § 2; Laws, 1987, ch. 425, § 8; Laws, 1993, ch. 409, § 1; Laws, 1996, ch. 363, § 1; Laws, 1999, ch. 325, § 1, eff. 7/1/1999.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 345, SB 2355, 1, eff. 3/14/2014.\n\n(1)The board may acquire for sale to a veteran a home situated in the State of Mississippi, provided that the cost of such home to the board does not exceed the maximum loan limit as provided in 38 USCS Section 3703 by application of the housing loan guaranty for housing loans to veterans as defined in 38 USCS Section 3701. A veteran purchasing such home may advance a sum of money on the purchase price of the home. In addition to the home acquisition, the board may also provide the funds for any funding fee charged by the Department of Veterans Affairs for any loan contract underwritten or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs even if the home acquisition cost and the funding fee together exceed the maximum loan amount.Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the acquisition for sale to a veteran by the Veterans' Home Purchase Board of the State of Mississippi of a home, the title to which has, prior to the date of such purchase, been vested in such veteran if title thereto is vested in such veteran due to (a) the veteran previously owning the land and the purpose of the application is to finance a home on the land; (b) the veteran having taken title to the land for the purpose of obtaining construction financing or otherwise constructing or making a major renovation of a home on the land; or (c) the veteran having previously taken title to the land and home under a nonpermanent purchase money lien to secure his ability to purchase the property while awaiting processing, approval and closing of his application with the board.The proceeds of the purchase approved may be applied toward the liquidation of a purchase money lien, contractor's or materialman's lien, or temporary construction loan outstanding against the property if the board should determine that the indebtedness secured by such liens or loan is not adequately financed on a permanent basis.(2)The limit provided above on the cost of property to the board may be exceeded in the case of a veteran who has been certified for the purchase of a home under Public Law No. 782 of the 80th Congress, by Public Law No. 286 of the 81st Congress, and other amendments thereto, which provides special benefits to veterans who have lost the use of both legs. In such cases where the federal government donates half of the cost of a dwelling for such a disabled veteran, as provided by Public Law No. 286, and, further, where the Department of Veterans Affairs guarantees half of the remainder of the purchase price, the board may increase the amount of money to be advanced for such a purchase to the maximum loan limits, as provided above.(3)Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, the board shall not consider an application to refinance a home with adequate permanent financing with a lending institution, individual or other entity, or the refinancing of the veteran's equity in a home to which he has title. The board will consider, on a case-by-case basis, the adequacy of financing when a veteran has title to the property and financing with variable rates, terms or payments where the board can ascertain that the loan was made with temporary intent on either the part of the veteran or lender, or where the veteran is in jeopardy of losing the financing due to no fault of his own. In such cases, the board shall ascertain that the present lender has no objection to the early payoff of the loan and that the veteran has not obtained and continued any form of temporary financing for the purpose of waiting for financing by the board when he could have previously obtained adequate, permanent financing.(4)The board shall not consider applications for purchase that would provide the veteran with a second home, or provide funds to be used either directly or indirectly for investment purposes. The veteran must divest himself of any personal residence before being eligible to close the board purchase on a new property. Divestment may be accomplished by sale which transfers title to another individual, or by an irrevocable lease/purchase contract, or land contract where title passes after the prescribed payment. This requirement that the veteran divest himself may be waived by the board in cases where the board can ascertain that the ownership of such property was originally intended as a temporary residence or a condominium or mobile home, or that the veteran's present residence is inadequate for his needs; and in cases where the requirement to sell on short notice will cause a financial hardship or loss to the veteran in the market place; and in cases where the sale of the present residence is not necessary to free the veteran of obligations to qualify financially for the new loan. When such waiver is granted, the veteran must agree in writing (a) not to reside in the former residence for a period of ten (10) years, (b) that the rent proceeds in excess of mortgage payments and cash expenses on the old home will be paid to the board as a reduction to the loan balance on the new home, and (c) that, at the sale of the old home within a period of ten (10) years, a full disclosure of the sale shall be made to the board and proceeds of the sale in excess of mortgage payoff and actual cost of the sale will be paid to the board as a reduction to the balance of the existing loan with the board.(5)The board may provide for the refinancing of permanent mortgage loans under the following conditions:(a)Funds are available to the board from the issuance of its notes or bonds in amounts in excess of the funds required for applicants on a waiting list for their first loan from the board.(b)The veteran has an outstanding mortgage or mortgages on the property to be refinanced.(c)The terms and conditions of the refinance loan complies with the Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan program guidelines for refinance.(d)The refinance loan shall be limited to the payoff of existing mortgages plus the closing costs of the transaction and further limited to eighty percent (80%) of the property value or amount of the Department of Veterans Affairs guaranty available on the refinance loan.(e)The board may establish interest rates, terms and conditions on refinance loans which may differ from original loans made by the board.Codes, 1942, § 7520; Laws, 1936, ch. 199; Laws, 1946, ch. 221, § 7; Laws, 1948 ch. 493, § 1 ch. 500, § 7, 1950, ch. 465, § 7; Laws, 1956, ch. 352, § 1; Laws, 1958, ch. 460, § 3; Laws, 1962, ch. 478, § 1; Laws, 1964, ch. 479; Laws, 1968, ch. 481, § 1; Laws, 1974, ch. 404, § 1; Laws, 1979, ch. 313, § 1; Laws, 1985, ch. 501, § 2; Laws, 1987, ch. 425, § 8; Laws, 1993, ch. 409, § 1; Laws, 1996, ch. 363, § 1; Laws, 1999, ch. 325, § 1, eff. 7/1/1999.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 345, SB 2355, 1, eff. 3/14/2014.\n\n(1)The board may acquire for sale to a veteran a home situated in the State of Mississippi, provided that the cost of such home to the board does not exceed the maximum loan limit as provided in 38 USCS Section 3703 by application of the housing loan guaranty for housing loans to veterans as defined in 38 USCS Section 3701.

In such cases where the federal government donates half of the cost of a dwelling for such a disabled veteran, as provided by Public Law No. 286, and, further, where the Department of Veterans Affairs guarantees half of the remainder of the purchase price, the board may increase the amount of money to be advanced for such a purchase to the maximum loan limits, as provided above.(3)Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, the board shall not consider an application to refinance a home with adequate permanent financing with a lending institution, individual or other entity, or the refinancing of the veteran's equity in a home to which he has title. The board will consider, on a case-by-case basis, the adequacy of financing when a veteran has title to the property and financing with variable rates, terms or payments where the board can ascertain that the loan was made with temporary intent on either the part of the veteran or lender, or where the veteran is in jeopardy of losing the financing due to no fault of his own. In such cases, the board shall ascertain that the present lender has no objection to the early payoff of the loan and that the veteran has not obtained and continued any form of temporary financing for the purpose of waiting for financing by the board when he could have previously obtained adequate, permanent financing.(4)The board shall not consider applications for purchase that would provide the veteran with a second home, or provide funds to be used either directly or indirectly for investment purposes. The veteran must divest himself of any personal residence before being eligible to close the board purchase on a new property. Divestment may be accomplished by sale which transfers title to another individual, or by an irrevocable lease/purchase contract, or land contract where title passes after the prescribed payment. This requirement that the veteran divest himself may be waived by the board in cases where the board can ascertain that the ownership of such property was originally intended as a temporary residence or a condominium or mobile home, or that the veteran's present residence is inadequate for his needs; and in cases where the requirement to sell on short notice will cause a financial hardship or loss to the veteran in the market place; and in cases where the sale of the present residence is not necessary to free the veteran of obligations to qualify financially for the new loan. When such waiver is granted, the veteran must agree in writing (a) not to reside in the former residence for a period of ten (10) years, (b) that the rent proceeds in excess of mortgage payments and cash expenses on the old home will be paid to the board as a reduction to the loan balance on the new home, and (c) that, at the sale of the old home within a period of ten (10) years, a full disclosure of the sale shall be made to the board and proceeds of the sale in excess of mortgage payoff and actual cost of the sale will be paid to the board as a reduction to the balance of the existing loan with the board.(5)The board may provide for the refinancing of permanent mortgage loans under the following conditions:(a)Funds are available to the board from the issuance of its notes or bonds in amounts in excess of the funds required for applicants on a waiting list for their first loan from the board.(b)The veteran has an outstanding mortgage or mortgages on the property to be refinanced.(c)The terms and conditions of the refinance loan complies with the Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan program guidelines for refinance.(d)The refinance loan shall be limited to the payoff of existing mortgages plus the closing costs of the transaction and further limited to eighty percent (80%) of the property value or amount of the Department of Veterans Affairs guaranty available on the refinance loan.(e)The board may establish interest rates, terms and conditions on refinance loans which may differ from original loans made by the board.Codes, 1942, § 7520; Laws, 1936, ch. 199; Laws, 1946, ch. 221, § 7; Laws, 1948 ch. 493, § 1 ch. 500, § 7, 1950, ch. 465, § 7; Laws, 1956, ch. 352, § 1; Laws, 1958, ch. 460, § 3; Laws, 1962, ch. 478, § 1; Laws, 1964, ch. 479; Laws, 1968, ch. 481, § 1; Laws, 1974, ch. 404, § 1; Laws, 1979, ch. 313, § 1; Laws, 1985, ch. 501, § 2; Laws, 1987, ch. 425, § 8; Laws, 1993, ch. 409, § 1; Laws, 1996, ch. 363, § 1; Laws, 1999, ch. 325, § 1, eff. 7/1/1999.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 345, SB 2355, 1, eff. 3/14/2014.\n\nNothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the acquisition for sale to a veteran by the Veterans' Home Purchase Board of the State of Mississippi of a home, the title to which has, prior to the date of such purchase, been vested in such veteran if title thereto is vested in such veteran due to (a) the veteran previously owning the land and the purpose of the application is to finance a home on the land; (b) the veteran having taken title to the land for the purpose of obtaining construction financing or otherwise constructing or making a major renovation of a home on the land; or (c) the veteran having previously taken title to the land and home under a nonpermanent purchase money lien to secure his ability to purchase the property while awaiting processing, approval and closing of his application with the board.\n\nThe proceeds of the purchase approved may be applied toward the liquidation of a purchase money lien, contractor's or materialman's lien, or temporary construction loan outstanding against the property if the board should determine that the indebtedness secured by such liens or loan is not adequately financed on a permanent basis.\n\nCodes, 1942, § 7520; Laws, 1936, ch. 199; Laws, 1946, ch. 221, § 7; Laws, 1948 ch. 493, § 1 ch. 500, § 7, 1950, ch. 465, § 7; Laws, 1956, ch. 352, § 1; Laws, 1958, ch. 460, § 3; Laws, 1962, ch. 478, § 1; Laws, 1964, ch. 479; Laws, 1968, ch. 481, § 1; Laws, 1974, ch. 404, § 1; Laws, 1979, ch. 313, § 1; Laws, 1985, ch. 501, § 2; Laws, 1987, ch. 425, § 8; Laws, 1993, ch. 409, § 1; Laws, 1996, ch. 363, § 1; Laws, 1999, ch. 325, § 1, eff. 7/1/1999.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2014, ch. 345, SB 2355, 1, eff. 3/14/2014.",

The balance of said selling price may be amortized over a period to be fixed by the board, but not exceeding thirty (30) years, together with interest thereon at a rate which shall be fixed by the board, which shall in no case be less than two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) per annum, and which shall in no case be higher than the rate of interest authorized and permitted by the Veterans' Administration for loans guaranteed under the provisions of Title III of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended. The purchaser shall have the right at any time to pay any or all installments still remaining unpaid. In any individual case, the board may for good cause postpone from time to time, upon such terms as the board may deem proper, the payment of the whole or any part of any installment of the selling price or interest thereon. The board is empowered in each individual case to specify the terms of the contract entered into with the purchaser, not contrary to the provisions of this chapter.(2)Before the purchase of any property by the board, there must be filed with said board an appraisement of the fair and reasonable value of such property by a qualified appraiser. Each appraisement shall state, among other things, that it is made in good faith and that the valuation is honestly determined and represents the bona fide opinion of the maker.(3)The board, before consummating the purchase under the provisions of this section, shall be satisfied that title to the property sought to be purchased is good.Codes, 1942, §§ 7520, 7522; Laws, 1936, ch. 199; Laws, 1946, ch. 221, §§ 7, 9-11; Laws, 1948, ch. 493, § 1, ch. 500, §§ 7, 9-11; Laws, 1950, ch. 465, §§ 7, 9-11; Laws, 1956, ch. 352, §§ 1, 2; Laws, 1958, ch. 460, §§ 3, 5; Laws, 1962, ch. 478, §§ 1, 3; Laws, 1964, ch. 479; Laws, 1968, ch. 481, §§ 1, 2; Laws, 1974, ch. 404, § 3; Laws, 1979, ch. 313, § 4; Laws, 1985, ch. 501, § 5; Laws, 1987, ch. 425, § 10; Laws, 2009, ch. 306, § 1, eff. 3/2/2009.\n\nCodes, 1942, §§ 7520, 7522; Laws, 1936, ch. 199; Laws, 1946, ch. 221, §§ 7, 9-11; Laws, 1948, ch. 493, § 1, ch. 500, §§ 7, 9-11; Laws, 1950, ch. 465, §§ 7, 9-11; Laws, 1956, ch. 352, §§ 1, 2; Laws, 1958, ch. 460, §§ 3, 5; Laws, 1962, ch. 478, §§ 1, 3; Laws, 1964, ch. 479; Laws, 1968, ch. 481, §§ 1, 2; Laws, 1974, ch. 404, § 3; Laws, 1979, ch. 313, § 4; Laws, 1985, ch. 501, § 5; Laws, 1987, ch. 425, § 10; Laws, 2009, ch. 306, § 1, eff. 3/2/2009.",

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the board may apply the proceeds from the issuance of its notes under this section or the issuance of its bonds under any other applicable law, as follows:(i)Refinancing of permanent mortgage loans, subject to the conditions specified in Section35-7-17(5).(ii)Increasing the purchase limit on homes as provided in Section35-7-17(1).The board shall have the authority to sell outright its mortgages and deeds of trust at market value, or discounted to present value, as hereinabove provided and to service said mortgages for the purchaser, collecting the principal and interest due the owner of such mortgages, and to charge therefor a reasonable service fee to be mutually agreed upon by the purchaser of such mortgages and the board.Any notes issued by the board must be approved at a regular meeting of the board, upon favorable vote by a majority of four (4) members of the board, who shall authorize the chairman and the executive director of said board to issue and sign such notes as the official deed and act of the whole board.(e)Any additional monies appropriated or obtained to extend the benefits of this chapter shall be commingled with and become an integral part of the revolving fund provided by this section, and the method of accounting therefor shall be the same as used with respect to any other monies in the revolving fund.Codes, 1942, § 7531; Laws, 1936, ch. 199; Laws, 1946, ch. 221, §§ 21, 22; Laws, 1948, ch. 500, §§ 19-21: 1950, ch. 465, §§ 19-22; Laws, 1952, ch. 311, § 2; Laws, 1956, ch. 353; Laws, 1958, ch. 460, § 7; Laws, 1962, ch. 478, § 4; Laws, 1987, ch. 425, § 17, eff. 5/1/1987.\n\n(a)Any money previously appropriated to the revolving fund of the board or that may be hereinafter appropriated shall be commingled, exclusive of escrow funds provided for in Section35-7-31, into a general revolving fund for carrying out the provisions of this chapter. The expense of administering this chapter shall be paid from the revolving fund within the limitations provided by Section35-7-9. The revolving fund of the board will constitute a trust fund and shall be segregated from all other funds in the State Treasury. All interest earned by the State Treasury on any investment of the Veterans' Home Purchase Board Revolving Fund shall be placed to the credit of such fund. The State Fiscal Management Board is authorized and directed to draw warrants upon such funds from time to time upon requisition of the board executed by its executive officer, and the State Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to pay such warrants.(b)The money repaid by the purchaser shall be deposited in the board's revolving fund and shall be available under the same conditions as the original appropriation. The board shall have continuing authority to expend funds up to the maximum amount received into the special revolving fund, limited to the discretionary best judgment of the board as to reserve. The board shall submit to the State Fiscal Management Board, the Legislative Budget Office, legislative appropriation committees, and other such authority as may arise or be deemed necessary, an annual budget, using the standard general fund budget format as a model, but modified to reflect an accurate and management-oriented view of the revolving fund, and an annual report reflecting a detailed analysis of all revenue and expenditures. All funds in the revolving fund in excess of the one percent (1%) administrative expense allowance shall be expended or committed for new loans with the exception of the reserve judged necessary by the board.(c)The board, with the advice and consent of the State Bond Commission, may also sell or hypothecate its mortgage loans to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the United States Government or to any subsidiary agency thereof, or to any other agency, private or public, when a sale of such mortgage loans would be to the advantage of the board. However, no mortgage loans may be sold for less than the prevailing market value, which may include sale at a discount from book value when discounted to present value to equate to market yields, of said loans as determined by the State Bond Commission. The provisions of this section may also include the discounting to present value of lower interest rate loans to the mortgagor to encourage early payoff of the loan.(d)The board may issue its notes in such amounts and for such terms as the board may deem advisable to provide additional funds for purchase of veterans' homes, and such notes shall be eligible for purchase by any agency of the State of Mississippi. The repayment of such notes shall be guaranteed by the board, and any and all income to the board from the repayments of the principal and interest on its purchases by veterans shall be first pledged to repayment of any maturing notes. The maturity dates, denomination or amount, and rate of interest of such notes shall be determined by the board; however, such notes shall in no event exceed a term of thirty (30) years nor bear a higher rate of interest than one percent (1%) below that received by the board on its mortgages and deeds of trust.
