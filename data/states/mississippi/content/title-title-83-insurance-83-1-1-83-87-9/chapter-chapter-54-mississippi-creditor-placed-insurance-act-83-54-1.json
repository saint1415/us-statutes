You will be charged interest on the premium at the rate of ____________________ per annum.The insurance we buy will pay claims to us (the creditor) for physical damage to your property. It will not pay any claims made against you and it may not pay you for any claims you make. The insurance we buy will not give you any liability insurance coverage and will not meet any other requirements of state law.We may receive compensation for placing this insurance, which is included in the cost of coverage charged to you.The property coverage we buy will start on the date shown in the policy or certificate, which may go back to the date of the loan or the date your prior coverage stopped.
