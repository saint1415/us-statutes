      "text": "(1)Definitions.The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this section only:(a)\"Acquisition\" means any agreement, arrangement or activity the consummation of which results in a person acquiring directly or indirectly the control of another person, and includes, but is not limited to, the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance and mergers.(b)An \"involved insurer\" includes an insurer which either acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired, or is the result of a merger.(2)Scope.(a)Except as exempted in paragraph (b) of this subsection, this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state;(b)This section shall not apply to the following:(i)A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes so long as the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in this state. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under Section83-6-1(c), it is not solely for investment purposes unless the commissioner of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state;(ii)The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if preacquisition notification is filed with the commissioner in accordance with subsection (3)(a) of this section thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition. However, such preacquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this section if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by any other subparagraph of this paragraph (b);(iii)The acquisition of already affiliated persons;(iv)An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition:1.In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed five percent (5%) of the total market;2.There would be no increase in any market share; or3.In no market would:a.The combined market share of the involved insurers exceeds twelve percent (12%) of the total market; andb.The market share increase by more than two percent (2%) of the total market.For the purpose of this subsection (2)(b)(iv), a market means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state;(v)An acquisition for which a preacquisition notification would be required pursuant to this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business;(vi)An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner affirmatively finds that the insurer is in failing condition; there is a lack of feasible alternative to improving such condition; the public benefits of improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; and the findings are communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state.(3)Preacquisition notification; waiting period.An acquisition covered by subsection (2) may be subject to an order pursuant to subsection (5) unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a preacquisition notification. The commissioner shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under this subsection in the same manner as provided in this chapter.(a)The preacquisition notification shall be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) relating to those markets which, under subsection (2)(b)(iv) of this section, cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this section. The commissioner may require such additional material and information as deemed necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of subsection (4) of this section. The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indicating his or her ability to render an informed opinion.(b)The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt of the commissioner of a preacquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of receipt, or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the commissioner on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of the additional information by the commissioner or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner.(4)Competitive standard.(a)The commissioner may enter an order under subsection (5)(a) of this section with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with subsection (3) of this section.(b)In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the commissioner shall consider the following:(i)Any acquisition covered under subsection (2) of this section involving two (2) or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards.1.If the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:Insurer AInsurer B4%4% or more10%2% or more15%1% or more2.Or, if the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:Insurer AInsurer B5%5% or more10%4% or more15%3% or more19%1% or moreA highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four (4) largest insurers is seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two (2) insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two (2) columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in paragraph (a) of this subsection. For the purpose of this item, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be Insurer A.(ii)There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two (2) largest to the eight (8) largest, has increased by seven percent (7%) or more of the market over a period of time extending from any base year five (5) to ten (10) years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. Any acquisition or merger covered under subsection (2) of this section involving two (2) or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in paragraph (a) of this subsection if:1.There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;2.One (1) of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share; and3.Another involved insurer's market is two percent (2%) or more.(iii)For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection (4):1.The term \"insurer\" includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership or control;2.The term \"market\" means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the commissioner shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the NAIC and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition.
