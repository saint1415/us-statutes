The funds or amount borrowed for the purpose provided for in this section shall be paid within a period of ten years from the date borrowed, and shall be paid out of the funds collected under this chapter. All bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness maturing each year and the interest thereon, however, shall be first provided for and paid out of said funds. The loans authorized herein shall not be subject to other limitations, restrictions, or provisions of the general laws governing the borrowing of money, amounts of indebtedness, budget, and election; and said loans may be made by the board of supervisors of such county either by issuance of county bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness which shall be full faith and credit obligations of the county issuing the same and shall be payable, both as to principal and interest, from the same sources of revenue and taxes made available for the payment of road protection bonds under the provisions of this chapter. The money herein authorized to be borrowed may be borrowed by such board of supervisors from any person, firm, corporation, governmental lending agency, or from any sinking funds of such county, provided that if the money be borrowed from any sinking fund, it shall be repaid before the sinking fund from which it is borrowed, when supplemented by funds paid into same, is needed. Before the board of supervisors shall borrow money under this section, it shall spread on its minutes an order reciting such intention and shall thereafter publish a copy of such order, in two weekly issues of some newspaper having a general circulation in the county. If, within fifteen days after the first publication of a copy of such order, twenty-five per cent of the qualified electors of the county petition the board of supervisors for an election to determine whether or not the adoption of such order should be annulled, such election shall be ordered by such board of supervisors. If at such election a majority of those voting vote in favor of the adoption of such order, the same shall be valid and effective; but if a majority shall vote against such order, it shall be annulled and shall be ineffective, and no further effort shall be made to borrow funds under this section by such board for a period of six months from the date of such election. If no such petition be presented within fifteen days after the first publication of a copy of such order, such order shall be valid and effective.
