Upon the awarding of a contract for such state aid project, the board of supervisors of any county will, by an official order of the board, authorize the State Aid Engineer to set up the project fund for such project from that county's state aid fund in the State Treasury. The amount of the project fund will cover the estimated cost of the project, including the contractor's payments and any other costs authorized under this chapter to be paid from state aid funds. Withdrawals from the project fund will be made by requisitions prepared by the State Aid Engineer, based on estimates and other supporting statements and documents prepared or approved by the county engineer, such requisitions, accompanied by such estimates and statements, to be directed to the Department of Finance and Administration, which will issue warrants in payment thereof. Requisitions may be drawn to cover the final cost of the project accepted by the boards of supervisors of the counties affected and the State Aid Engineer, even though such cost exceeds the aforesaid estimated project fund.

Upon the awarding of a contract for such state aid project, the board of supervisors of any county will, by an official order of the board, authorize the State Aid Engineer to set up the project fund for such project from that county's state aid fund in the State Treasury. The amount of the project fund will cover the estimated cost of the project, including the contractor's payments and any other costs authorized under this chapter to be paid from state aid funds. Withdrawals from the project fund will be made by requisitions prepared by the State Aid Engineer, based on estimates and other supporting statements and documents prepared or approved by the county engineer, such requisitions, accompanied by such estimates and statements, to be directed to the Department of Finance and Administration, which will issue warrants in payment thereof. Requisitions may be drawn to cover the final cost of the project accepted by the boards of supervisors of the counties affected and the State Aid Engineer, even though such cost exceeds the aforesaid estimated project fund. Whenever, in the opinion of the State Aid Engineer, it should appear that any such estimate or statement of account has been improperly allowed or that any road construction project is not proceeding in accordance with the plans, specifications and standards set up therefor, then, in such event, due notice in writing shall be given the board of supervisors of such county and the contractor on such project, if any, stating the reason why such account should not have been allowed or why such project is not progressing satisfactorily; and if, within thirty (30) days from the date of such notice in writing, such error or default is not corrected to the satisfaction of the State Aid Engineer, all state aid funds theretofore allocated to such eligible county shall be immediately withdrawn and notice given the Department of Finance and Administration and the State Treasurer that such county has become ineligible therefor. Such county shall remain ineligible until it again becomes eligible by satisfying the State Aid Engineer as to its eligibility.(b)On state aid projects on the federal aid secondary system which are to be partially financed with federal funds, state aid funds credited to such county in the State Aid Road Fund shall be available to cover the sponsor's share of the cost of such project. At the same time, the State Treasurer, on order from the board of supervisors, shall transfer an amount up to one hundred percent (100%) of such cost from the credit of such county in the State Aid Road Fund to the credit of such county in the State Highway Fund, earmarked for such project.(c)State aid road funds credited to a county in the State Aid Road Fund shall also be available to cover the sponsor's cost of any other project of such county which is partially financed with federal funds available through federal \"safer off-system\" road funds and/or other federal road funds allocated to the counties as provided for in accordance with Section65-9-29(2). On order from the board of supervisors of such county, the State Treasurer shall transfer an amount up to one hundred percent (100%) of such cost from the credit of such county in the State Aid Road Fund to the credit of such county in the State Highway Fund, earmarked for such project.(d)Up to one-third (1/3) of state aid road funds credited to a county in the State Aid Road Fund may be available to match federal bridge replacement monies or other federal funds, or both, to construct, replace, inspect or post bridges and to conduct pavement management surveys on county roads which are not on the state aid system. To implement such projects, the State Treasurer shall, as requested in an order from the board of supervisors of the county, make transfers out of the credit of such county in the State Aid Road Fund.(e)Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the state aid road funds credited to a county in the State Aid Road Fund may be available for projects authorized under the Local System Road Program. Withdrawals from the fund for the Local System Road Program will be made by requisitions prepared by the State Aid Engineer, based on estimates and other supporting statements and documents prepared or approved by the county engineer; such requisitions, accompanied by such estimates and statements, to be directed to the Department of Finance and Administration, which will issue warrants in payment thereof. Requisitions may be drawn to cover the final cost of the local system road project accepted by the boards of supervisors of the counties affected and the State Aid Engineer even though such cost exceeds the aforesaid estimated project fund. Whenever, in the opinion of the State Aid Engineer, it should appear that any such estimate or statement of account has been improperly allowed or that any road construction project is not proceeding in accordance with the plans, specifications and standards set up therefor, then, in such event, due notice in writing shall be given the board of supervisors of such county and the contractor on such project, if any, stating the reason why such account should not have been allowed or why such project is not progressing satisfactorily; and if, within thirty (30) days from the date of such notice in writing, such error or default is not corrected to the satisfaction of the State Aid Engineer, all state aid funds theretofore allocated to such eligible county shall be immediately withdrawn and notice given the Department of Finance and Administration and the State Treasurer that such county has become ineligible therefor.

Each county shall be allocated a percentage of such funds as they become available, which percentage shall be based:(i)One-half (1/2) on the proportion that the total number of state aid system bridges in the county bears to the total number of state aid system bridges in all counties of the state; and(ii)One-half (1/2) on the proportion that the total square footage of deck area of all state aid system bridges in the county bears to the total square footage of deck area of all state aid system bridges in all counties of the state.(b)For the purposes of this subsection, (i) the term \"deficient bridge\" means a bridge with a condition rating of fair or less for its deck, superstructure or substructure, as determined by National Bridge Inspection Standards and that is included on the latest annual bridge inventory prepared by the Office of State Aid Road Construction and (ii) the term \"state aid system bridge\" means a bridge that is included on the latest annual official bridge inventory prepared by the Office of State Aid Road Construction, excluding bridges on the local bridge system and the rural major collector system.Codes, 1942, § 8035-05; Laws, 1949, Ex.
