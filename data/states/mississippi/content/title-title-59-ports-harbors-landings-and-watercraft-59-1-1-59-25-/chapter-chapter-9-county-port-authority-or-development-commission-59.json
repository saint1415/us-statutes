In the exercise of eminent domain, the county, acting through the port authority or development commission, shall determine the amount and character of the land or estate therein thus to be acquired and the public necessity for such exercise and their determination shall be conclusive and shall not be subject to attack in the absence of manifold abuse of discretion or fraud on the part of said county in making such determination and said county, acting through the port authority or development commission, shall have all powers and authority vested in persons or corporations having the right of eminent domain by Sections11-27-1through11-27-49and all other statutes pertinent thereto.(c)To accept assurances and other agreements from persons, firms and corporations who are benefited by any action of the port authority pursuant to this chapter, including agreements to save the county harmless on account of any assurances given by the county to the United States of America or any agency thereof, including the Secretary of the Army, and to enter into contracts with such persons, firms or corporations relative to the future development and use of property owned by such persons, firms or corporations.(d)To obligate the county by contract with persons, firms and corporations owning or agreeing to purchase property in the area benefited by any action of the port authority under the provisions of this chapter for the construction, development, improvement or expansion of channels and other navigation projects by the county at its expense and the continued maintenance and operation thereof by the county at its expense for a period of time not to exceed ninety-nine (99) years, or so long as any such person, firm or corporation continues to use said property for industrial operations.(e)To obtain liability insurance as deemed appropriate for the needs of the port authority or development commission. If liability insurance is in effect, the port authority or development commission may be sued by anyone affected to the extent of such insurance carried; however, immunity from suit is waived only to the extent of such liability insurance carried, and a judgment creditor shall have recourse only to the proceeds or right to proceeds of such liability insurance.(f)To invest funds credited to the county development commission. A county development commission is vested with authority to designate depositories of its funds and to deposit its funds in insured, interest-bearing accounts or securities guaranteed by the good faith of the United States Treasury. All funds in excess of ninety (90) days' operating expenses, to the extent practicable, shall be invested in United States Treasury bills, interest-bearing accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or other securities of the United States Government including United States Treasury bills, notes and bonds, federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed as to repayment of principal by the United States Government, or repurchase agreements and mutual funds invested in obligations of the United States Government or its agencies and repurchase agreements fully collateralized by such obligations.Codes, 1942, § 7605-06; Laws, 1956, ch. 199, § 6; Laws, 1958, ch. 226, § 6; Laws, 1960, ch. 345, § 1; Laws, 1961, 2nd Ex.

In this case an additional clause shall be included in the lease agreement to provide that upon termination of the lease agreement prior to the retirement of all revenue bonds issued under Section 1 of Chapter 306, Laws of 1987, such payments by the United States Navy or the United States Department of Defense as are necessary to retire such revenue bonds shall become due and payable on the date of the termination of the lease.(6)This section is to be considered as supplementary and cumulative and nothing in this section shall be construed as repealing existing laws, or as repealing or amending any options, leases, deeds, contracts, agreements or legal instruments heretofore entered into by the board of supervisors of such county, the county port authority, the governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located, or the port commission.

When the results of the election on the question of the issuance of such bonds shall have been canvassed by the election commissioners of such county and certified by them to the board of supervisors of such county, it shall be the duty of such board of supervisors to determine and adjudicate whether or not a majority of the qualified electors who voted thereon in such election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds, and unless a majority of the qualified electors who voted thereon in such election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then such bonds shall not be issued. Should a majority of the qualified electors who vote thereon in such election vote in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then the board of supervisors of the county may issue such bonds, either in whole or in part, within two years from the date of such election, or within two years after the final favorable termination of any litigation affecting the issuance of such bonds, as such board shall deem best. However, the board of supervisors, in its discretion may, in lieu of the foregoing provisions, adopt a resolution reciting its intention to issue bonds for the purposes authorized by this chapter, stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued and the date upon which further action will be taken by the board looking toward the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three successive weeks in a newspaper published and of general circulation within such county. The first of such publications shall be made at least twenty-one days prior to the date set forth in said resolution as the date upon which further action will be taken by the board, and the last of such publications shall be made not more than seven days prior to such date. If, prior to the date set forth as aforesaid, there shall be filed with the clerk of such board a petition in writing signed by twenty per cent (20%) of the qualified electors of such county, requesting an election on the question of the issuance of such bonds, then such bonds shall not be issued unless authorized by a majority of the qualified electors of such county who vote thereon at an election to be ordered by such board for that purpose. Notice of such election shall be given and such election shall be held and conducted in like manner as provided by law with respect to the submission of other county bond issues in such county. If the proposition so submitted shall fail to receive approval at such election, then no further proceedings for the issuance of such bonds shall be had or taken within a period of six months from and after the date of such election. If, however, no such petition shall be so filed, or if at such election, or subsequent election, such proposition be assented to by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon, then such board of supervisors shall be authorized to proceed with the issuance of such bonds without further election.Codes, 1942, § 7605-15; Laws, 1956, ch. 199, § 15; Laws, 1958, ch. 226, § 9; Laws, 1960, ch. 211, § 2.\n\nA county-wide election shall be held to determine whether such bonds, as are provided for in Sections59-9-37and59-9-41, may be issued.

Such county and municipality, acting through the board of supervisors of such county, and the governing authorities of such municipality are authorized to jointly issue bonds or other obligations to provide funds for such joint undertakings. Such bonds shall be issued as provided in Sections59-9-37through59-9-51, but shall be jointly issued by the board of supervisors of such county and by the governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located, acting concurrently. Such bonds shall be denominated as port improvement bonds of the county and municipality issuing the same. Unless three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors of such county who voted in an election to be held for that purpose shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds and three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors of the municipality in which the port of entry is located who voted in an election held for that purpose shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then such bonds shall not be issued. Electors of such county who vote in such election vote in favor of the issuance of such bonds and should three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors of the municipality in which the port of entry is located who vote in such election vote in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then the board of supervisors of such county and the governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located may issue such bonds, either in whole or part, within three years after the date of such election or within three years after the termination of any litigation affecting the issuance of such bonds, as such board of supervisors and such governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located jointly shall deem best. For the payment of such bonds and interest thereon, the board of supervisors of such county and the governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located, may each pledge the two-mill ad valorem tax authorized by Section59-9-59, or such part thereof as may be required for the payment of such bonds and interest thereon. Such county and municipality, acting jointly, may also pledge for the payment of such bonds and interest thereon, the revenues from all or any of the facilities operated or to be operated jointly by the county port authority or county development commission and port commission and any revenues accruing to such county and municipality under and by virtue of Section59-7-1or59-7-303, and not theretofore pledged or hypothecated, and any such county may also pledge any surplus funds accruing by virtue of Section65-33-45or65-33-47, Mississippi Code of 1972, and not theretofore pledged or hypothecated, and any other surplus funds available to such county or municipality from any other source. Such bonds shall not be computed as being within any statutory limitation on the issuance of municipal or county bonds, but the two-mill ad valorem tax, or such part thereof as may be necessary for the payment of such bonds and interest thereon, as well as any revenues accruing to such county and municipality under and by virtue of Section59-7-1or59-7-303, and any surplus accruing to such county under Section65-33-45or65-33-47, Mississippi Code of 1972, and not theretofore pledged or hypothecated, shall be irrevocably pledged to the payment of such bonds and interest. Any bonds, or other obligations issued pursuant to this section shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all the purposes of the Mississippi Uniform Commercial Code. Whenever any county and municipality, acting jointly, shall have issued bonds hereunder, a portion of which remain outstanding and unpaid, and the governing authorities of such county and municipality, acting jointly, desire to issue additional bonds hereunder for the purposes herein authorized and desire to consolidate all such bonded indebtedness, such governing authorities, by resolution or resolutions, may at any time authorize and direct the issuance of bonds. The proceeds of such new bonds shall be used to take up, pay and redeem all of such outstanding and unpaid bonds at their par value, and the balance of such proceeds shall be used and expended for the purposes authorized by this section. In the event that such outstanding bonds, by the terms thereof, shall be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of such county and municipality, acting jointly, then such option of redemption shall be exercised in the manner provided in such bonds, or in the event that such outstanding bonds, by the terms thereof, be not so redeemable prior to maturity, then the consent of the holder or holders thereof shall first be had and obtained to the end that, in either of said events, the redemption of such outstanding bonds may be accomplished concurrently with the issuance of such new bonds. Such new bonds shall be issued in like manner and like incidence and shall be payable from the same source or sources and the payment thereof shall be secured in like manner as herein provided in the case of the issuance of original bonds hereunder. In lieu of selling such portion of such new bonds as may be required to provide for the redemption of such outstanding bonds, such new bonds may be issued and delivered in exchange for and upon surrender and cancellation of a like amount of such outstanding bonds.\n\nCodes, 1942, § 7605-17; Laws, 1956, ch. 199, § 17; Laws, 1958, ch. 226, § 11.",

No interest payment due on any bond shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and supplemental coupons will not be permitted; the difference between the highest rate of interest specified for any bond issue shall not exceed the lowest rate of interest specified for the same bond issue by more than one and one-fourth percent (1-1/4%). Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in a multiple of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) and a zero rate of interest cannot be named. Such bonds shall be signed by the president of the board of supervisors of such county, and the official seal of the county shall be affixed thereto, attested by the clerk of the board of supervisors of such county. The interest coupons to be attached to such bonds may be executed by the facsimile signatures of said officer. Whenever any such bonds shall have been signed by the officers herein designated to sign the bonds who were in office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds and coupons shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to the purchaser or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear.(3)Before issuing such bonds, the board of supervisors of such county shall adopt a resolution declaring its intention to issue such bonds, stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued and the date upon which further action will be taken by the board looking toward the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three (3) successive weeks in a newspaper published and of general circulation within such county. The first of such publications shall be made at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the date set forth in said resolution as the date upon which further action will be taken by the board, and the last of such publications shall be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date. If, prior to the date set forth as aforesaid, there shall be filed with the clerk of such board a petition in writing signed by twenty percent (20%) of the qualified electors of such county, requesting an election on the question of the issuance of such bonds, then such bonds shall not be issued unless authorized by a majority of the qualified electors of such county who vote thereon at an election to be ordered by such board for that purpose. Notice of such election shall be given and such election shall be held and conducted in like manner as provided by law with respect to the submission of other county bond issues in the county. If, however, no such petition shall be so filed, or if at such election, or subsequent election, such proposition be assented to by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon, then such board of supervisors shall be authorized to proceed with the issuance of such bonds without further election.(4)The board of supervisors of such county shall sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of said county, but in no case to exceed the rate of interest hereinabove provided, but no such sale shall be made at a price less than par plus accrued interest to date of delivery of the bonds to the purchaser. Notice of the sale of any such bonds shall be published at least one (1) time not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of sale and shall be published in a newspaper published in and having general circulation within the county.(5)The resolution or order adopted by the board of supervisors authorizing the issuance of said bonds shall pledge the sources of revenues authorized under the statutes to pay the principal thereof and interest thereon; and all bonds issued under one (1) resolution or order may be equally secured and entitled to be paid. In addition to such pledge, such bonds shall be payable from an ad valorem tax which may be levied without limit as to rate or amount upon all taxable property within the county.Codes, 1942, § 7605-23; Laws, 1956, ch. 199, § 23; Laws, 1967, Ex.
