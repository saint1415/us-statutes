      "text": "(1)Any taxpayer aggrieved by an assessment of tax by the agency, by the agency's denial of a refund claim, by the denial of a waiver of tag penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, and who wishes to contest the action of the agency shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the agency mailed or delivered written notice of the action, file an appeal in writing with the Board of Review requesting a hearing and correction of the contested action specifying in detail the relief requested and any other information that might be required by regulation. Even after an appeal is filed with the Board of Review, the agency retains the authority to change the assessment, the denial of refund claim or the denial of tag penalty being appealed.(2)Upon receipt of a timely written appeal from a tax assessment, refund claim denial, denial of waiver of a tag penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, a hearing shall be scheduled before the Board of Review unless it is determined that the relief requested in the written appeal should be granted without a hearing. A notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the taxpayer advising the taxpayer of the date, time and location of the hearing. The taxpayer or his designated representative shall attend the hearing unless a request is made to, and granted by, the Board of Review to allow the taxpayer to submit his position in writing or by electronic transmission in lieu of attendance. Failure of the taxpayer or his designated representative to attend a hearing or to submit his position in writing or by electronic transmission by the date specified by the Board of Review or by the hearing date, if no date was specified, shall constitute a withdrawal of the appeal.(3)At a hearing before the Board of Review on a tax assessment, denial of refund claim, denial of waiver of a tag penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, the Board of Review shall try the issues presented, according to law and the facts and within the guidelines established by regulation. The hearing before the Board of Review shall be informal and no official transcript will be made of the hearing. At the earliest practical date after the hearing, the members of the Board of Review that heard the appeal shall make a determination on the matter presented and notify the taxpayer of its findings by mailing a copy of its order to the taxpayer. If the order involves the appeal of a denial of a waiver of tag penalty, a copy of the order shall also be mailed to the tax collector that imposed the penalty. If in the order the Board of Review orders the taxpayer to pay a tax assessment, the taxpayer shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the Board of Review mailed the order, pay the amount ordered to be paid or appeal the order of the Board of Review to the Board of Tax Appeals. After the sixty-day period, if an appeal is not filed by the taxpayer with the Executive Director of the Board of Tax Appeals and the tax determined by the Board of Review is not paid, the agency shall proceed to collect the tax assessment as determined by the Board of Review.(4)Any taxpayer aggrieved by an order of the Board of Review affirming a tax assessment, the denial of a refund claim, the denial of a waiver of tag penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, and who wishes to contest the order shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the Board of Review mailed the order being contested, file an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals. The appeal shall be in writing and shall request a hearing and reversal or modification of the order of the Board of Review, specify in detail the relief requested and contain any other information that might be required by regulation, and be filed with the executive director. At the time of filing his appeal with the executive director, the taxpayer shall also file a copy of his written appeal with the Board of Review. Even after an appeal is filed with the Executive Director of the Board of Tax Appeals, the Board of Review retains the authority to amend and/or correct the order being appealed at any time prior to a decision by the Board of Tax Appeals on the appeal. Failure to timely file a written appeal with the executive director within the sixty-day period shall make the order of the Board of Review final and not subject to further review by the Board of Tax Appeals or a court, other than as to the issue of whether a written appeal from the order of the Board of Review was timely filed with the executive director. If the Board of Review shall not issue an order within six (6) months of a hearing, the taxpayer may treat the failure to issue an order as a denial of the relief requested in the hearing and appeal such deemed denial to the Board of Tax Appeals as provided in this section. A taxpayer's filing or failure to file an appeal based on this deemed denial shall not prejudice or otherwise jeopardize the taxpayer's right to file an appeal with the Board of Tax Appeals upon the Board of Review's issuance of a subsequent order in the manner provided for in this section.(5)Upon receipt of a written appeal from an order of the Board of Review affirming a tax assessment, refund claim denial, denial of waiver of a tag penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, the executive director shall schedule a hearing before the Board of Tax Appeals on the appeal. A notice of this hearing shall be mailed to the taxpayer and the agency advising them of the date, time and location of hearing. The taxpayer or his designated representative shall attend the hearing unless a request is made to and granted by the Executive Director of the Board of Tax Appeals to allow the taxpayer to submit his position in writing or by electronic transmission in lieu of attendance. Failure of the taxpayer or his designated representative to attend a hearing or to submit his position in writing or by electronic transmission by the date specified by the executive director or by the hearing date, if no date was specified, shall constitute a withdrawal of the appeal.(6)(a)At any hearing before the Board of Tax Appeals on an appeal of an order of the Board of Review affirming a tax assessment, refund claim denial, denial of waiver of a tag penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, two (2) members of the Board of Tax Appeals shall constitute a quorum. At the hearing, the Board of Tax Appeals shall conduct a hearing on all factual and legal issues raised by the taxpayer which address the substantive or procedural propriety of the actions of the Department of Revenue being appealed, according to the law and the facts and pursuant to any procedural guidelines established by regulation.(b)At a hearing of any action brought under this section, the Board of Tax Appeals shall give no deference to the decision of the Board of Review, but shall give deference to the department's interpretation and application of the statutes as reflected in duly enacted regulations and other officially adopted publications. The Board of Tax Appeals shall conduct a hearing on all factual and legal issues raised by the taxpayer which address the substantive or procedural propriety of the actions being appealed. The Board of Tax Appeals shall decide all factual and legal questions presented, including those as to legality and the amount of tax or refund due as well as whether and to what extent the imposition of interest and/or penalties is warranted under the facts of the case, and if it finds that the tax assessment, denial of refund claim or other action of the agency in issue is incorrect or invalid, in whole or in part, it shall determine the amount of tax or refund due, including interest and, if applicable, penalty to date, and enter such order or judgment as it deems proper. Interest and penalty included in this determination shall be computed by the Board of Tax Appeals based on the methods for computing penalty and interest as specified by law for the type of tax in issue, and the Board of Tax Appeals shall have the same discretion as the commissioner in determining whether and to what extent such amounts are warranted under the facts of the case. The rules of evidence shall be relaxed at the hearing.(c)Any appeal to chancery court from an order of the Board of Tax Appeals resulting from this type of hearing shall include a full evidentiary judicial hearing on all factual and legal issues raised by the taxpayer which address the substantive or procedural propriety of the department's action being appealed. No official transcript shall be made of this hearing before the Board of Tax Appeals.(d)After reaching a decision on the issues presented, the Board of Tax Appeals shall enter its order setting forth its findings and decision on the appeal. A copy of the order of the Board of Tax Appeals shall be mailed to the taxpayer and the agency. If the order involves an appeal of a denial of a waiver of tag penalty, a copy of the order shall also be mailed to the tax collector that imposed the penalty.(e)If the Board of Tax Appeals shall not issue an order within nine (9) months of a hearing, the taxpayer may treat the failure to issue an order as a denial of the relief requested in the hearing and appeal such deemed denial to the chancery court as provided in Section27-77-7. A taxpayer's filing or failure to file an appeal based on this deemed denial shall not prejudice or otherwise jeopardize the taxpayer's right to file an appeal with the chancery court upon the Board of Tax Appeals' issuance of a subsequent order in the manner provided for in Section27-77-7.(7)If in its order the Board of Tax Appeals orders a taxpayer to pay a tax assessment, the taxpayer shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the Board of Tax Appeals mailed the order, pay the amount ordered to be paid or properly appeal the order of the Board of Tax Appeals to chancery court as provided in Section27-77-7. During the sixty (60) days after the date the Board of Tax Appeals mailed the order, if the taxpayer provides additional documentation or information, the commissioner may further reduce the amount due by the taxpayer. The commissioner shall have thirty (30) days from the date the taxpayer mails or otherwise provides in writing the additional documentation or information to issue a determination, during which the sixty-day appeal period provided in Section27-77-7is tolled. If the commissioner issues a determination in less than thirty (30) days, the appeal period shall begin to run again at the time of the written notice of the commissioner's determination. Written notice by the commissioner shall indicate that the sixty-day appeal period has begun to run again as of the date of the notice, and shall provide the taxpayer the date on which the appeal period will expire. After the sixty-day period, if the tax determined by the Board of Tax Appeals or the reduced amount determined by the commissioner to be due is not paid and an appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals order has not been properly filed, the agency shall proceed to collect the tax assessment as affirmed by the Board of Tax Appeals or reduced by the commissioner. If in its order the Board of Tax Appeals determines that the taxpayer has overpaid his taxes and an appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals order has not been properly filed in chancery court, the agency shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the Board of Tax Appeals mailed its order, refund or credit to the taxpayer, as provided by law, the amount of overpayment as determined and set out in the order.(8)At any time after the filing of an appeal to the Board of Review or from the Board of Review to the Board of Tax Appeals under this section, an appeal can be withdrawn. Such a withdrawal of an appeal may be made voluntarily by the taxpayer or may occur involuntarily as a result of the taxpayer failing to appear at a scheduled hearing, failing to make a written submission or electronic transmission in lieu of attendance at a hearing by the date specified or by the hearing date, if no date was specified, or by any other act or failure that the Board of Review or the Board of Tax Appeals determines represents a failure on the part of the taxpayer to prosecute his appeal. Any voluntary withdrawal shall be in writing or by electronic transmission and sent by the taxpayer or his designated representative to the chairman of the Board of Review, if the appeal being withdrawn is to the Board of Review, or to the executive director, if the appeal being withdrawn is to the Board of Tax Appeals. If the withdrawal of appeal is involuntary, the administrative appeal body from whom the appeal is being withdrawn shall note on its minutes the involuntary withdrawal of the appeal and the basis for the withdrawal. Once an appeal is withdrawn, whether voluntary or involuntary, the action from which the appeal was taken, whether a tax assessment, a denial of refund claim, a denial of waiver of tax penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, or an order of the Board of Review, shall become final and not subject to further review by the Board of Review, the Board of Tax Appeals or a court, other than as to the issue of whether a taxpayer's actions or inactions constituted a failure on the part of the taxpayer to prosecute his appeal. The agency shall then proceed in accordance with law based on such final action.(9)Nothing in this section shall bar a taxpayer from timely applying to the commissioner as otherwise provided by law for a tax refund or for a revision in tax.(10)Any appeal or other filing with the Board of Review or Board of Tax Appeals pursuant to this section shall be considered timely if it is hand delivered during the regular office hours of the recipient by the due date of such filing, or if it is mailed, postmarked or shipped by such due date. Any appeal or other filing to the Board of Review or Board of Tax Appeals pursuant to this section shall also be considered timely if electronically transmitted via electronic mail, electronic filing or facsimile by midnight of the due date for such filing. The timeliness of such electronic filing shall be determined in all instances based on the local time zone of the recipient. If the due date for any appeal or other filing with the Board of Review or Board of Tax Appeals should fall on a Saturday, Sunday, official state holiday, or other day on which the Department of Revenue or Board of Tax Appeals is closed, the due date for the filing shall be the next business day in which the Department of Revenue or Board of Tax Appeals is open.Laws, 2005, ch. 499, § 3; Laws, 2009, ch. 492, § 114, eff. 7/1/2010.Amended by Laws, 2020, ch. 448, HB 861,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2020.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 476, HB 799, 16, eff. 1/1/2015.\n\n(1)Any taxpayer aggrieved by an assessment of tax by the agency, by the agency's denial of a refund claim, by the denial of a waiver of tag penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, and who wishes to contest the action of the agency shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the agency mailed or delivered written notice of the action, file an appeal in writing with the Board of Review requesting a hearing and correction of the contested action specifying in detail the relief requested and any other information that might be required by regulation.

The Board of Tax Appeals shall conduct a hearing on all factual and legal issues raised by the taxpayer which address the substantive or procedural propriety of the actions being appealed. The Board of Tax Appeals shall decide all factual and legal questions presented, including those as to legality and the amount of tax or refund due as well as whether and to what extent the imposition of interest and/or penalties is warranted under the facts of the case, and if it finds that the tax assessment, denial of refund claim or other action of the agency in issue is incorrect or invalid, in whole or in part, it shall determine the amount of tax or refund due, including interest and, if applicable, penalty to date, and enter such order or judgment as it deems proper. Interest and penalty included in this determination shall be computed by the Board of Tax Appeals based on the methods for computing penalty and interest as specified by law for the type of tax in issue, and the Board of Tax Appeals shall have the same discretion as the commissioner in determining whether and to what extent such amounts are warranted under the facts of the case. The rules of evidence shall be relaxed at the hearing.(c)Any appeal to chancery court from an order of the Board of Tax Appeals resulting from this type of hearing shall include a full evidentiary judicial hearing on all factual and legal issues raised by the taxpayer which address the substantive or procedural propriety of the department's action being appealed. No official transcript shall be made of this hearing before the Board of Tax Appeals.(d)After reaching a decision on the issues presented, the Board of Tax Appeals shall enter its order setting forth its findings and decision on the appeal. A copy of the order of the Board of Tax Appeals shall be mailed to the taxpayer and the agency. If the order involves an appeal of a denial of a waiver of tag penalty, a copy of the order shall also be mailed to the tax collector that imposed the penalty.(e)If the Board of Tax Appeals shall not issue an order within nine (9) months of a hearing, the taxpayer may treat the failure to issue an order as a denial of the relief requested in the hearing and appeal such deemed denial to the chancery court as provided in Section27-77-7. A taxpayer's filing or failure to file an appeal based on this deemed denial shall not prejudice or otherwise jeopardize the taxpayer's right to file an appeal with the chancery court upon the Board of Tax Appeals' issuance of a subsequent order in the manner provided for in Section27-77-7.(7)If in its order the Board of Tax Appeals orders a taxpayer to pay a tax assessment, the taxpayer shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the Board of Tax Appeals mailed the order, pay the amount ordered to be paid or properly appeal the order of the Board of Tax Appeals to chancery court as provided in Section27-77-7. During the sixty (60) days after the date the Board of Tax Appeals mailed the order, if the taxpayer provides additional documentation or information, the commissioner may further reduce the amount due by the taxpayer. The commissioner shall have thirty (30) days from the date the taxpayer mails or otherwise provides in writing the additional documentation or information to issue a determination, during which the sixty-day appeal period provided in Section27-77-7is tolled. If the commissioner issues a determination in less than thirty (30) days, the appeal period shall begin to run again at the time of the written notice of the commissioner's determination. Written notice by the commissioner shall indicate that the sixty-day appeal period has begun to run again as of the date of the notice, and shall provide the taxpayer the date on which the appeal period will expire. After the sixty-day period, if the tax determined by the Board of Tax Appeals or the reduced amount determined by the commissioner to be due is not paid and an appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals order has not been properly filed, the agency shall proceed to collect the tax assessment as affirmed by the Board of Tax Appeals or reduced by the commissioner. If in its order the Board of Tax Appeals determines that the taxpayer has overpaid his taxes and an appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals order has not been properly filed in chancery court, the agency shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the Board of Tax Appeals mailed its order, refund or credit to the taxpayer, as provided by law, the amount of overpayment as determined and set out in the order.(8)At any time after the filing of an appeal to the Board of Review or from the Board of Review to the Board of Tax Appeals under this section, an appeal can be withdrawn. Such a withdrawal of an appeal may be made voluntarily by the taxpayer or may occur involuntarily as a result of the taxpayer failing to appear at a scheduled hearing, failing to make a written submission or electronic transmission in lieu of attendance at a hearing by the date specified or by the hearing date, if no date was specified, or by any other act or failure that the Board of Review or the Board of Tax Appeals determines represents a failure on the part of the taxpayer to prosecute his appeal. Any voluntary withdrawal shall be in writing or by electronic transmission and sent by the taxpayer or his designated representative to the chairman of the Board of Review, if the appeal being withdrawn is to the Board of Review, or to the executive director, if the appeal being withdrawn is to the Board of Tax Appeals. If the withdrawal of appeal is involuntary, the administrative appeal body from whom the appeal is being withdrawn shall note on its minutes the involuntary withdrawal of the appeal and the basis for the withdrawal. Once an appeal is withdrawn, whether voluntary or involuntary, the action from which the appeal was taken, whether a tax assessment, a denial of refund claim, a denial of waiver of tax penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, or an order of the Board of Review, shall become final and not subject to further review by the Board of Review, the Board of Tax Appeals or a court, other than as to the issue of whether a taxpayer's actions or inactions constituted a failure on the part of the taxpayer to prosecute his appeal. The agency shall then proceed in accordance with law based on such final action.(9)Nothing in this section shall bar a taxpayer from timely applying to the commissioner as otherwise provided by law for a tax refund or for a revision in tax.(10)Any appeal or other filing with the Board of Review or Board of Tax Appeals pursuant to this section shall be considered timely if it is hand delivered during the regular office hours of the recipient by the due date of such filing, or if it is mailed, postmarked or shipped by such due date. Any appeal or other filing to the Board of Review or Board of Tax Appeals pursuant to this section shall also be considered timely if electronically transmitted via electronic mail, electronic filing or facsimile by midnight of the due date for such filing. The timeliness of such electronic filing shall be determined in all instances based on the local time zone of the recipient. If the due date for any appeal or other filing with the Board of Review or Board of Tax Appeals should fall on a Saturday, Sunday, official state holiday, or other day on which the Department of Revenue or Board of Tax Appeals is closed, the due date for the filing shall be the next business day in which the Department of Revenue or Board of Tax Appeals is open.Laws, 2005, ch. 499, § 3; Laws, 2009, ch. 492, § 114, eff. 7/1/2010.Amended by Laws, 2020, ch. 448, HB 861,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2020.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 476, HB 799, 16, eff. 1/1/2015.\n\nLaws, 2005, ch. 499, § 3; Laws, 2009, ch. 492, § 114, eff. 7/1/2010.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2020, ch. 448, HB 861,§ 1, eff. 7/1/2020.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2014, ch. 476, HB 799, 16, eff. 1/1/2015.",

      "text": "(1)The findings and order of the Board of Tax Appeals entered under Section27-77-5shall be final unless the agency or the taxpayer shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the Board of Tax Appeals mailed the order, file a petition in the chancery court appealing the order. If the petition under this subsection is filed by the taxpayer, the petition shall be filed against the Department of Revenue as respondent. If the petition under this subsection is filed by the agency, the petition shall be filed against the taxpayer as respondent. The petition shall contain a concise statement of the facts as contended by the petitioner, identify the order from which the appeal is being taken and set out the type of relief sought. If in the action, the taxpayer is seeking a refund or credit for an alleged overpayment of any tax other than individual or corporate income tax or franchise tax, the taxpayer shall allege in the petition or in his answer, where the appeal is filed by the agency, that he alone bore the burden of the tax sought to be refunded or credited and did not directly or indirectly collect the tax from anyone else; however, this requirement shall not apply in any case involving a claim for incentives based on payroll withholding or other incentives, rebates or other economic benefits the computation of which is based, in whole or in part, upon taxes withheld or paid. The respondent to the petition has thirty (30) days from the date of service of the petition to file a cross-appeal.(2)A petition under subsection (1) of this section shall be filed in the chancery court of the county or judicial district in which the taxpayer has a place of business or in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi; however, a resident taxpayer may file the petition in the chancery court of the county or judicial district in which he is a resident. If both the agency and the taxpayer file a petition under subsection (1) of this section, the appeals shall be consolidated and the chancery court where the taxpayer filed his petition shall have jurisdiction over the consolidated appeal.(3)Unless otherwise ordered by the chancery court upon motion by the agency, no taxpayer appealing an order of the Board of Tax Appeals under this section shall be required to post security or a bond, or otherwise pay to the agency, under protest or otherwise, any contested taxes, interest, penalties or other amounts. After a petition or cross-appeal is filed by a taxpayer under this section, if the agency believes that its ability to obtain payment from the taxpayer of the taxes, penalties and interest in issue is jeopardized by its inability to proceed with collection due to the filing of the appeal or cross-appeal by the taxpayer or if the agency believes that the appeal or cross-appeal is being brought to delay payment of the taxes, penalties or interest in issue, the agency may move the chancery court to require the taxpayer to post a bond or other adequate security for the payment of any judgment of the court. Upon consideration of such motion, after notice and hearing, the chancellor shall determine whether a bond or other security is needed to protect the interest of the state in regard to the timely payment of the taxes, penalties and interest in issue. If the chancellor determines that a bond or other security is necessary to protect the interest of the state, the chancellor shall provide the taxpayer sixty (60) days from the date that he enters an order on the motion to post with the clerk of the court the bond or other security that the chancellor determines is needed to protect the state's interest. To avoid the accruing of additional penalty and interest while an appeal is pending, a taxpayer appealing an order of the Board of Tax Appeals affirming a tax assessment may, prior to the filing of the petition, pay to the agency, under protest, the amount ordered by the Board of Tax Appeals to be paid and seek a refund of such taxes, plus interest thereon, in the appeal. The taxpayer shall pay to the agency any tax included in the assessment which he is not contesting. If the petition initiating the appeal is filed by the taxpayer, the payment of the uncontested tax shall be made prior to the expiration of the sixty-day time period for filing a petition under subsection (1) of this section or the commissioner may institute collection proceedings for such uncontested amount. If the petition initiating the appeal is filed by the agency, the payment of the uncontested tax shall be made prior to the expiration of the sixty-day time period for the filing of the petition. Failure of the taxpayer to timely pay the uncontested tax shall not bar the taxpayer from obtaining a reduction, abatement and/or refund of any contested tax in the appeal and shall not result in the taxpayer's appeal or cross-appeal being dismissed or delayed or judgment being entered granting the agency the relief it requested.(4)In an action under this section resulting from an order of the Board of Tax Appeals involving a refund claim denial, the agency shall refund or credit to the taxpayer, as provided by law, the amount of any overpayment included in the refund claim which the agency does not contest. If the petition initiating the appeal is filed by the agency, the uncontested overpayment shall be paid or credited to the taxpayer prior to the expiration of the sixty-day time period for filing a petition under subsection (1) of this section. If the petition initiating the appeal is filed by the taxpayer, such uncontested overpayment shall be paid or credited to the taxpayer prior to the expiration of the thirty-day time period for the filing of an answer or other response to the petition as provided in subsection (5) of this section. Failure of the agency to timely pay or credit the uncontested overpayment to the taxpayer shall bar the agency from obtaining an affirmation, in whole or in part, of the refund claim denial in issue until the payment or claim is made, but shall not result in the agency's appeal or cross-appeal being dismissed or judgment being entered granting the taxpayer the relief he requested.(5)Upon the filing of the petition under subsection (1) of this section, the clerk of the court shall issue a summons to the respondent requiring the respondent to answer or otherwise respond to the petition within thirty (30) days of service. Where the agency is the respondent, the summons shall be served on the agency by personal service on the commissioner as the chief executive officer of the agency. The chancery court in which a petition under subsection (1) of this section is properly filed shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause or issues joined as in other cases. In any petition, cross-appeal or answer in which the taxpayer is seeking a refund or credit for an alleged overpayment of any tax other than individual or corporate income tax or franchise tax the taxpayer shall prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he alone bore the burden of the tax sought to be refunded or credited and did not directly or indirectly collect the tax from anyone else; however, this requirement shall not apply in any case involving a claim for incentives based on withholding taxes or other incentives, rebates or other economic benefits the computation of which is based, in whole or in part, upon taxes withheld or paid. At trial of any action brought under this section, the chancery court shall give no deference to the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, the Board of Review or the Department of Revenue, but shall give deference to the department's interpretation and application of the statutes as reflected in duly enacted regulations and other officially adopted publications. The chancery court shall try the case de novo and conduct a full evidentiary judicial hearing on all factual and legal issues raised by the taxpayer which address the substantive or procedural propriety of the actions of the Department of Revenue being appealed. The chancery court is expressly prohibited from trying any action filed pursuant to this section using the more limited standard of review specified for appeals in Section27-77-13of this chapter. Based on the evidence presented at trial, the chancery court shall determine whether the party bringing the appeal has proven by a preponderance of the evidence or a higher standard if required by the issues raised, that he is entitled to any or all of the relief he has requested. The chancery court shall decide all factual and legal questions presented, including those as to legality and the amount of tax, refund, tax credit or tax incentive due as well as whether and to what extent the imposition of interest and/or penalties are warranted under the facts of the case, and if it finds that the tax assessment, denial of the claim for a tax refund, tax credit or tax incentive or other action of the agency in issue is incorrect or invalid, in whole or in part, it shall determine the amount of tax or refund due, including interest and, if applicable, penalty to date, and enter such order or judgment as it deems proper. Interest and penalty included in this determination shall be computed by the court based on the methods for computing penalty and interest as specified by law for the type of tax in issue, and the court shall have the same discretion as the commissioner in determining whether and to what extent such amounts are warranted under the facts of the case. When the chancery court determines that an overpayment exists, the determination as to whether such overpayment shall be refunded to the taxpayer or credited against the taxpayer's future taxes shall be made by the chancery court based on the method for handling overpayments as specified by the law for the type of tax in issue. Either the agency or the taxpayer, or both, shall have the right to appeal from the order of the chancery court to the Supreme Court as in other cases. If an appeal is taken from the order of the chancery court, any bond or other security required to be posted by order of the chancery court shall continue to remain in place until a final decision is rendered in the case.Laws, 2005, ch. 499, § 4; Laws, 2009, ch. 492, § 115, eff. 7/1/2010.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 476, HB 799, 17, eff. 1/1/2015.\n\n(1)The findings and order of the Board of Tax Appeals entered under Section27-77-5shall be final unless the agency or the taxpayer shall, within sixty (60) days from the date the Board of Tax Appeals mailed the order, file a petition in the chancery court appealing the order.

The chancery court shall try the case de novo and conduct a full evidentiary judicial hearing on all factual and legal issues raised by the taxpayer which address the substantive or procedural propriety of the actions of the Department of Revenue being appealed. The chancery court is expressly prohibited from trying any action filed pursuant to this section using the more limited standard of review specified for appeals in Section27-77-13of this chapter. Based on the evidence presented at trial, the chancery court shall determine whether the party bringing the appeal has proven by a preponderance of the evidence or a higher standard if required by the issues raised, that he is entitled to any or all of the relief he has requested. The chancery court shall decide all factual and legal questions presented, including those as to legality and the amount of tax, refund, tax credit or tax incentive due as well as whether and to what extent the imposition of interest and/or penalties are warranted under the facts of the case, and if it finds that the tax assessment, denial of the claim for a tax refund, tax credit or tax incentive or other action of the agency in issue is incorrect or invalid, in whole or in part, it shall determine the amount of tax or refund due, including interest and, if applicable, penalty to date, and enter such order or judgment as it deems proper. Interest and penalty included in this determination shall be computed by the court based on the methods for computing penalty and interest as specified by law for the type of tax in issue, and the court shall have the same discretion as the commissioner in determining whether and to what extent such amounts are warranted under the facts of the case. When the chancery court determines that an overpayment exists, the determination as to whether such overpayment shall be refunded to the taxpayer or credited against the taxpayer's future taxes shall be made by the chancery court based on the method for handling overpayments as specified by the law for the type of tax in issue. Either the agency or the taxpayer, or both, shall have the right to appeal from the order of the chancery court to the Supreme Court as in other cases. If an appeal is taken from the order of the chancery court, any bond or other security required to be posted by order of the chancery court shall continue to remain in place until a final decision is rendered in the case.Laws, 2005, ch. 499, § 4; Laws, 2009, ch. 492, § 115, eff. 7/1/2010.Amended by Laws, 2014, ch. 476, HB 799, 17, eff. 1/1/2015.\n\nLaws, 2005, ch. 499, § 4; Laws, 2009, ch. 492, § 115, eff. 7/1/2010.\n\nAmended by Laws, 2014, ch. 476, HB 799, 17, eff. 1/1/2015.",

As soon as practical after the show cause hearing, the hearing officer or the board of review shall make a determination as to whether the IFTA license or IRP registration should be revoked or suspended. The hearing officer or board of review shall enter an order based on this determination and a copy of this order shall be mailed to the IFTA licensee or IRP registrant notifying him of the decision and the action taken.(4)The order of the hearing officer or the board of review in regard to a show cause hearing shall be final unless, within thirty (30) days from the date of the order, the IFTA licensee or IRP registrant appeals the order to the Board of Tax Appeals.

At the hearing the Board of Tax Appeals shall try the issues presented according to law and the facts and pursuant to any guidelines established by regulation. The rules of evidence shall be relaxed at the hearing and the hearing shall be recorded by a court reporter. After reaching a decision on the issues presented, the Board of Tax Appeals shall enter an order setting forth its findings and decision on the appeal. A copy of the order of the Board of Tax Appeals shall be mailed to the person who filed the appeal and the agency to notify them of the findings and decision of the Board of Tax Appeals.(7)At any time after the filing of a timely written request with the board of review for a hearing on the intended revocation of an IFTA license or IRP registration under this section, the request may be withdrawn. A withdrawal of a request for a hearing on the intended revocation or suspension may be made voluntarily by the person requesting the hearing or may occur involuntarily as a result of a failure to appear at a scheduled hearing, or by any other act or failure that the board of review or designated hearing officer determines represents a failure on the part of that person to pursue his request for a hearing on the intended revocation or suspension. A voluntary withdrawal shall be in writing or by electronic transmission and sent from the person requesting the hearing or his designated representative to the chairman of the board of review or the hearing officer designated to hear the matter. If the withdrawal of the request for a hearing is involuntary, the board of review or the hearing officer designated to hear the matter shall note on its minutes or by order the involuntary withdrawal of the request and the basis for the withdrawal. Once a request for hearing on the intended revocation or suspension is withdrawn, whether voluntary or involuntary, the IFTA license or IRP registration shall be automatically revoked or suspended as set out in the notice of intent being appealed.(8)At any time after the filing of an appeal with the Board of Tax Appeals under this section, the appeal may be withdrawn. A withdrawal of an appeal can be made voluntarily by the person appealing or may occur involuntarily as the result of the failure to appear at a scheduled hearing, or by any other act or failure that the Board of Tax Appeals determines to represent a failure on the part of that person to prosecute his appeal. A voluntary withdrawal shall be in writing or by electronic transmission and sent from the person appealing or his designated representative to the executive director. If the withdrawal of the appeal is involuntary, the Board of Tax Appeals shall note on its minutes the involuntary withdrawal of the appeal and the basis for the withdrawal. Once an appeal is withdrawn under this section, whether voluntary or involuntary, the order from the show cause hearing from which the appeal was taken shall become final and not subject to further review by the Board of Tax Appeals or a court.

If the IFTA licensee or IRP registrant fails to file a written request with the board of review for a hearing on the intended revocation or suspension within the thirty-day period, the IFTA license or IRP registration shall be automatically revoked or suspended as set out in the notice of intent to revoke or suspend on the thirty-first day after the date of the notice without any further action by the agency. The agency retains jurisdiction to reinstate an IFTA license or IRP registration after revocation. Failure of the IFTA licensee or IRP registrant to timely file a written request for a hearing on the intended revocation will bar further review of the revocation or suspension by any court.(2)If an IRP registration is revoked or suspended, the IRP registrant shall surrender to the agency all IRP credentials for his IRP registration, and if not surrendered, his IRP credentials are subject to seizure and/or removal from the IRP registrant and/or from the vehicle or vehicles.(3)Upon receipt by the board of review of a timely filed written request for a hearing on the intended revocation or suspension of the IFTA license or IRP registration, the IFTA licensee or IRP registrant filing the request shall be advised of the date, time and location of a show cause hearing that will be held a minimum of thirty (30) days from the date of the notice.
