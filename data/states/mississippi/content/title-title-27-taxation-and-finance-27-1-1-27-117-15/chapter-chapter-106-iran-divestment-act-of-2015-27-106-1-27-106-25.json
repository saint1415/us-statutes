development of unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles, and its support of international terrorism represent a serious threat to the security of the United States, Israel and other allies of the United States in Europe, the Middle East and around the world.(b)The International Atomic Energy Agency has called attention repeatedly to Iran's unlawful nuclear activities, and as a result, the United Nations Security Council has adopted a range of sanctions designed to encourage the Government of Iran to cease those activities and comply with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.(c)On July 1, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 2194, the \"Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010\" (Public Law 111-195), which expressly authorizes states and local governments to prevent investment in, including prohibiting entry into or renewing contracts with, companies operating in Iran's energy sector with investments that have the result of directly or indirectly supporting the efforts of the Government of Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capability.(d)The serious and urgent nature of the threat from Iran demands that states, local governments and private institutions work together with the federal government and American allies to do everything possible diplomatically, politically and economically to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability.(e)Respect for human rights in Iran has deteriorated steadily, as demonstrated by transparently fraudulent elections and the brutal repression and murder, arbitrary arrests and show trials of peaceful dissidents.(f)The concerns of the State of Mississippi regarding Iran are strictly the result of the actions of the Government of Iran and should not be construed as enmity towards the Iranian people.(2)The intent of the Legislature is to implement the authority granted under Section 202 of the Comprehensive Iran
