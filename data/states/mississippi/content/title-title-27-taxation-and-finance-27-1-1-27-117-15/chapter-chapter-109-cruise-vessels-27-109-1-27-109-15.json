The term \"cruise vessel\" or \"vessel\" also includes a structure as described in Section97-33-1(b).(ii)For purposes of this subparagraph, the definitions of the words \"person\" and \"gaming license\" shall have the meanings ascribed to those words and terms in Section75-76-5.

The former licensee shall maintain all books, papers and records necessary for audits for a period of one (1) year after the date of the surrender or revocation of his privilege license.

For the purpose of the administration and enforcement of this chapter, the commission and the executive, supervisory and investigative personnel of the commission have the powers of a peace officer of this state.(6)The commission, or any of its members, has full power and authority to issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses at any place within this state, to administer oaths and to require testimony under oath.

If an application is denied, the commission shall prepare and file its written decision upon which its order denying the application is based.Laws, 1989, ch. 480, § 4; Laws, 1990, ch. 573, § 4, eff. 4/1/1990.\n\n(1)The State Tax Commission shall evaluate and consider any application for a license to operate a cruise vessel or vessel in a two-step process. First, the commission shall determine whether the applicant satisfies the requirements of Section27-109-5. Secondly, the commission shall determine whether any cruise vessel or vessel which may be operated by the licensee complies with applicable state law. This bifurcated process requires the issuance of a privilege license to the applicant and a separate certificate of suitability for each cruise vessel or vessel operated by the licensee.(2)For each step above the Tax Commission may:(a)Deny the application;(b)Remand the matter for such further investigation and reconsideration as the commission may order; or(c)By majority vote of the members present, grant the application for a privilege license or certificate of suitability. For the purposes of this section, a tie vote of the commission upon an application does not constitute a recommendation of denial of the application.(3)The privilege license granted under this chapter is specific to the applicant and shall remain in force and effect without regard to any cruise vessel or vessel operated by the licensee. However, no licensee shall operate a cruise vessel or vessel without a certificate of suitability for such cruise vessel or vessel.(4)An applicant must provide a surety bond to the State Tax Commission in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($ 250,000.00) for the faithful performance of all requirements imposed by law, regulation or conditions of the license. The State Tax Commission may accept from the applicant, in lieu of a surety bond, cash, time certificates of deposit, direct United States Treasury obligations which are fully guaranteed by the United States Government, or United States Government agency obligations which are fully guaranteed by the government of the United States.(5)If the commission is not satisfied that an applicant is qualified to be licensed under this chapter, the commission may cause to be made such investigation into and conduct such hearings concerning the qualifications of the applicant in accordance with its regulations as it may deem necessary.(6)If the commission desires further investigation be made or to conduct any hearings, it shall so notify the applicant and set a date for hearing, if a hearing is requested by the applicant.(7)The commission has full and absolute power and authority to deny any application for any cause it deems reasonable. If an application is denied, the commission shall prepare and file its written decision upon which its order denying the application is based.Laws, 1989, ch. 480, § 4; Laws, 1990, ch. 573, § 4, eff. 4/1/1990.\n\nLaws, 1989, ch. 480, § 4; Laws, 1990, ch. 573, § 4, eff. 4/1/1990.",
