However, gross receipts from business carried on in Mississippi, for the purposes of this section, shall also include any receipts from the taxpayer's business operations which are not apportioned but rather are directly allocated or assigned to this state. If the taxpayer is required to use a formula method of apportionment in making income tax returns which does not have a receipts or sales factor, then the receipts factor for the franchise tax formula shall be determined by regulation of the commission.(c)For purposes of this section, for tax returns for tax years ending on or after December 31, 2001, the ratio described in subsection (1) of this section shall include all gross receipts as specified in paragraph (b) of this subsection and where a taxpayer owns a direct or indirect interest in a flow-through entity, the taxpayer shall include in the ratio its portion of the flow-through entity's (i) real and tangible personal property owned in Mississippi and gross receipts from business carried on in Mississippi, and (ii) total real and tangible property owned and gross receipts wherever located and from wherever received. The taxpayer shall include its portion of the flow-through entity's assessed value of Mississippi property when determining its assessed value of Mississippi property. A flow-through entity's real property, tangible personal property, gross receipts and assessed value of property shall include its portion of these same items of any flow-through entity in which it owns a direct or indirect interest. For purposes of this section, flow-through entity is every form of organization other than a corporation, association or joint-stock company or other organization which would qualify for exemption under Section27-13-63if the organization were a corporation, association or joint-stock company.(d)For purposes of this section, receipts for sales to a Mississippi distribution facility of pharmaceutical products by a major supplier are not included in the Mississippi receipts in computing the apportionment ratio.
