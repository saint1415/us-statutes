If a noncustodial parent is absent or unknown, the custodial parent must complete the affidavit contemplated under Section93-31-5and attach it to the power of attorney.(d)A power of attorney under this chapter must be facilitated by either a child welfare agency that is licensed to place children for adoption and that is operating under the Safe Families for Children model or another charitable organization that is operating under the Safe Families for Children model.
