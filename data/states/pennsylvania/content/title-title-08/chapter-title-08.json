      "text": "§ 107. Reciprocal limitations. (a) Short title of section.-- This section shall be known and may be cited as the Reciprocal Limitations Act. (b) Legislative findings.-- It is hereby determined by the General Assembly to reaffirm the legislative findings contained in the act of November 28, 1986 (P.L.1465, No.146), known as the Reciprocal Limitations Act, and codified in this section: (1) The award of contracts to the lowest responsible bidder generally provides for the most economical procurement of supplies and construction. (2) In some cases, award to the lowest responsible bidder may not be the most economical and practicable when the best interests of the Commonwealth are concerned. (3) Some states apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or they apply a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders. (4) The application of this preference or prohibition by other states diminishes or eliminates opportunities for bidders and manufacturers who reside in this Commonwealth to obtain construction contracts from or to sell supplies to states that have this preference, thereby resulting in the loss of business for resident bidders and manufacturers. Therefore, in order to offset or counteract the discriminatory practices of other states, discourage other states from applying a preference and ultimately to aid employment, help business and industry located in this Commonwealth, attract new business and industry to this Commonwealth and provide additional tax revenue both from those receiving contracts and those employed by contractors, the General Assembly hereby declares that it is the policy of this Commonwealth to respond in like manner against those states that apply preferences or prohibitions by giving a similar offsetting preference to residents in this Commonwealth and bidders offering supplies manufactured in this Commonwealth and by prohibiting the purchase or use of certain supplies, in accordance with the provisions of this section. (c) Preference for supplies.-- In all procurements of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 (relating to small procurements), all Commonwealth agencies shall give preference to those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in this Commonwealth as against those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that gives or requires a preference to supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the other state for that particular supply. (d) Preference for resident bidders or offerors.-- When a contract for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 is to be awarded, a resident bidder or offeror shall be granted a preference as against a nonresident bidder or offeror from any state that gives or requires a preference to bidders or offerors from that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the state of the nonresident bidder or offeror. (e) Prohibition.-- For all contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, no Commonwealth agency shall specify for, use or procure any supplies which are produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that prohibits the specification for, use or procurement of these supplies in or on its public buildings or other works when these supplies are not produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. (f) Listing discriminating states.-- The department shall prepare a list of the states which apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or offerors or a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders or offerors and shall publish the list in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. When a state applies a new preference or prohibition, the department shall publish that information in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as an addition to the original list. (g) Inclusion in invitation for bids or request for proposals.-- In all invitations for bids and requests for proposals for the procurement of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, all Commonwealth agencies shall include a list of all the states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference favoring in-state supplies, bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 shall include a list of all states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference for in-state bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the purchasing agency for small procurements under section 514 shall also include a list of all states that apply a prohibition against certain supplies and shall inform potential bidders or offerors that they are prohibited from using supplies from those states. If a bid or proposal discloses that the bidder or offeror is offering supplies from a state which prohibits the use of out-of-state supplies, the bid or proposal shall be rejected. (h) Federal funds.-- The provisions of this section shall not be applicable when the application of this section may jeopardize the receipt of Federal funds. (i) Waiver.-- The provisions of this section may be waived when the head of the purchasing agency determines in writing that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth. (j) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Resident bidder or offeror.\" A person, partnership, corporation or other business entity authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth and having a bona fide establishment for transacting business in this Commonwealth at which it was transacting business on the date when bids or proposals for the public contract were first solicited.

The purpose of the decrease may be to achieve any of the following results: (1) A council which is less unwieldy in size. (2) A council which is comparable in size to those in boroughs not divided into wards. (3) A council consisting of an odd number of members instead of an even number. (4) A reduction in borough expenditures. (5) The expedition of the conduct of council meetings. (b) Petitions.-- A petition under subsection (a) shall clearly state whether the petitioners request that the number of members of the council to be elected in each ward shall be reduced from two to one, or from three to two or one, and the reasons why the reduction in number is desired. The petition may state whether it is necessary to add a council member or members to be elected at large in order to achieve or maintain a council consisting of at least seven members or to achieve or maintain a council consisting of an odd number of members. The sufficiency of the number of signers to the petition shall be ascertained as of the date the petition is presented to council. (c) Notice.-- The council shall give notice of the filing of the petition by advertisement in the legal newspaper of the county, if one is published in the county, and in one newspaper of general circulation, and of a day and time for a public meeting. After the public meeting, council may, by ordinance, decrease the number of council members elected from each ward from two to one, or from three to two or one, and may also provide for the election at large of a member or members of council. (d) Terms.-- Council shall, if necessary, establish a schedule for the subsequent at-large election of council members. The schedule may provide that the initial term of one or more of the council members subsequently elected at large shall be reduced to accommodate a schedule of staggered at-large elections to eventually ensure that, as nearly as possible, one-half of the members of council elected at large will be elected at each municipal election. The following shall apply: (1) At each municipal election in the borough, if there are two members from each ward, the electors of each ward shall elect one council member to hold office for a term of four years from the first Monday of January succeeding the election. (2) At each municipal election in the borough, if there is one member from each ward, the electors from each of the odd-numbered wards shall, at the first municipal election, elect one council member for a term of four years, and the electors from each of the even-numbered wards shall elect one council member for a term of two years. At each succeeding municipal election, the electors of the even-numbered wards or odd-numbered wards shall each elect one council member for a term of four years to take the place of those whose terms are about to expire.

At the second municipal election after the effective date of the ordinance, the electors shall elect a sufficient number of members of council, that, when added to the number of members of council elected at the previous municipal election, shall bring the membership of council to its full complement of seven.

(iv) At the second municipal election, seven members of council shall be elected in the borough, some to serve for a four-year term of office from the first Monday of January following the second municipal election, and the remainder to serve for a two-year term, in an amount to bring the number of members of council to be elected in the borough in succeeding elections into conformity with the number elected in other boroughs of the Commonwealth not divided into wards. (v) At the third and all subsequent municipal elections following the effective date of the ordinance, the electors shall elect three or four members of council, as the case may be, each to serve for a term of four years from the first Monday of January following the subsequent municipal election.

At the second municipal election following the effective date of the ordinance and at all subsequent municipal elections, the electors shall elect three or four members of council, as the case may be, to serve for a term of four years from the first Monday of January following the subsequent municipal election.

(a) Applicability.-- Design professional services shall be procured as provided in this section except as authorized by sections 514 (relating to small procurements), 515 (relating to sole source procurement) and 516 (relating to emergency procurement). (b) Policy.-- It is the policy of this Commonwealth to publicly announce all requirements for design professional services and to award contracts for design professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the types of services required. There shall be a committee to review the qualifications, experience and work of design professionals seeking contracts with purchasing agencies. (c) Selection committees for Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities.-- Where they are authorized by law to act as purchasing agency for design professional services, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities shall each establish as many selection committees as the department deems appropriate and a procedure for the selection of committee members. (d) Selection committee for all other Commonwealth agencies.-- Except as provided for in subsection (c), all purchasing agencies shall use the selection committee appointed by the Governor which shall be composed of five members, none of whom shall be employees of the Commonwealth or hold any elective office or office in any political party. The members shall be architects, engineers or other persons knowledgeable in construction. The members shall serve for terms of two years and shall not be removed except for cause. Of the original members, three shall serve for terms of two years and two for terms of one year. Thereafter, all terms shall be for two years. Each member shall be reimbursed for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred incident to attendance at meetings and to assigned duties and also a per diem allowance in accordance with Commonwealth travel policies. (e) Procedure for selection committees.-- The selection committees shall use the procedure set forth in this subsection: (1) The committee shall give public notice of projects requiring design services and publicly recommend to the purchasing agency three qualified design professionals for each project. (2) If desired, the committee may conduct discussions with three or more professionals regarding anticipated design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment. The committee shall select, based upon criteria established by the head of the purchasing agency, no less than three design professionals deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. In exercising its responsibility, the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) An equitable distribution of contracts to design professionals. (ii) Particular capability to perform the design or construction services for the contract being considered. (iii) Geographic proximity of the design professional to the proposed facility. (iv) The design professional selected has the necessary available personnel to perform the services required by the project. (v) Any other relevant circumstances peculiar to the proposed contract. (f) Design professionals.-- Except as provided for in subsection (g), the head of the purchasing agency shall select design professionals as follows: (1) Where the amount of the base construction allocation is less than $20,000,000, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The fee to be paid to the appointed design professional may be established by the selection committee or may be negotiated at the discretion of the head of the purchasing agency. The $20,000,000 threshold shall be adjusted by the department to reflect the annual percentage change in the Composite Construction Cost Index of the United States Department of Commerce occurring in the one-year period ending December 31 each year. (2) Where the amount of base construction allocation is in excess of or equal to $20,000,000, as annually adjusted, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee to begin contract negotiations. The fee to be paid to the design professional and the terms of the contract between the design professional and the department shall be negotiated by the head of the purchasing agency. In negotiating the contract and the fee, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, uniqueness and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the appointed design professional, negotiations with that design professional shall be terminated, and the head of the purchasing agency shall commence negotiations with one of the other firms chosen by the selection committee. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the second firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall terminate negotiations with the second design professional and commence negotiation with the third firm. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall choose additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this subsection until an agreement is reached. (g) Selection method for Department of Transportation, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Protection and State-affiliated entities.-- In the event the Department of Transportation, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection or a State-affiliated entity otherwise authorized by law to use its own selection committee requires the services of a design professional, the head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall negotiate with the firm determined to be the highest qualified firm for design professional services at a fee which is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth. In making this decision, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee he determines to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The head of the purchasing agency shall then undertake negotiations with the firm he determines to be the second highest qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the third highest qualified firm. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the committee shall select additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the protections and prohibitions contained in any law or regulation relating to the rights of the disabled.

Any change in salary, compensation or emoluments of the elected office shall become effective at the beginning of the next term of the member of council. (e.1) Alternative compensation.-- Notwithstanding subsection (e), the council may provide that members of the council shall receive compensation on a per-meeting basis based on attendance of members of council. Total annual compensation may not exceed the amounts specified in subsection (e). Compensation shall only be payable for duly advertised public meetings in which a member of council participated, except compensation is not payable if a member of council is absent from a meeting and the absence is not excused. Excused absence from a meeting shall be determined by council and shall include, but not be limited to, an emergency or illness of the member of council or the member's immediate family, as well as family or business travel.

(a) Duty of transferor.-- In the event of the sale or transfer of the ownership of a vehicle within this Commonwealth, the owner shall execute an assignment and warranty of title to the transferee in the space provided on the certificate or as the department prescribes, sworn to before a notary public or other officer empowered to administer oaths or verified by a wholesale vehicle auction licensed by the State Board of Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers and Salespersons, or its employee, or an issuing agent who is licensed as a vehicle dealer by the State Board of Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers and Salespersons, or its employee, and deliver the certificate to the transferee at the time of the delivery of the vehicle. (a.1) Exception for dealers.-- When a certificate of title for a vehicle acquired by a licensed dealer for the purpose of resale is encumbered by a lien or when there is a manufacturer's statement of origin for a new vehicle, delivery of the certificate of title or manufacturer's statement of origin by the dealer as a transferor at the time of delivery of the vehicle upon resale shall not be required if, prior to delivery of the vehicle, the dealer obtains the applicable powers of attorney to properly execute transfer of the title or manufacturer's statement of origin and the dealer requests and receives the departmental verification of any lienholders, ownership, odometer information and title brands, on titled vehicles, and any other information that the department deems necessary to be verified. Upon payment of the established fee, the department shall provide the dealer or authorized messenger service with verification of the required information. The department may supply the verified information by either written or electronic means. The application and a properly assigned certificate of title or manufacturer's statement of origin shall be delivered to the department within the time period prescribed by section 1103.1 (relating to application for certificate of title). If a dealer sells a vehicle after verification of the required information for a certificate of title encumbered by a lien, but fails to satisfy the lien or deliver an assignment and warranty of title to the dealer's transferee within 90 days of the date of purchase, and this failure is the result of an act or omission by the dealer, the dealer shall accept return of the vehicle from the transferee and shall refund the purchase price less actual depreciation of the vehicle while it was within the possession of the transferee. In refunding the purchase price, the price shall include the listed dollar value of any trade-in vehicle as stated in the sales transaction document in lieu of returning the transferee's trade-in vehicle. (a.2) Exception for sales at licensed wholesale auctions.-- In the event of the offering for sale or transfer of a vehicle between automobile dealers licensed by this Commonwealth or another state at a wholesale vehicle auction which is licensed by the State Board of Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers and Salespersons as a wholesale vehicle auction, the licensed dealer need not execute an assignment and warranty of title to the transferee at the time of the offering of the vehicle for sale if, prior to the offering of the sale of the vehicle, it is noted that the title is not present. The transferor shall deliver a properly assigned and warranted title to that transferee within ten days of the date that the vehicle was offered for sale, and the sale shall not be consummated until the transferor has delivered the title to the transferee. (b) Duty of transferee.-- Except as otherwise provided in section 1113 (relating to transfer to or from manufacturer or dealer), the transferee shall, within 20 days of the assignment or reassignment of the certificate of title, apply for a new title by presenting to the department the properly completed certificate of title, sworn to before a notary public or other officer empowered to administer oaths or verified before an issuing agent, who is licensed as a vehicle dealer by the State Board of Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers and Salespersons, or its employee, and accompanied by such forms as the department may require.

(c) Penalty.-- Any person violating subsection (a) shall be guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced: (1) For a first offense, to pay a fine of $100.

(a) Staggered renewal system to be established.-- The department shall establish a system of staggered registration renewal in a manner that an approximately equal number of registrations will expire every month throughout the year. In order to implement and maintain the staggered registration system, the department may prorate annual registration fees over registration periods of from 6 to 18 months. (a.1) Seasonal registration.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a passenger car, recreational motor vehicle, motorcycle, truck or farm vehicle which does not have a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 14,000 pounds may register the vehicle with the department for a period of successive months of less than one year. The applicant shall specify the period of months during which the vehicle shall be registered. Except when the department initially converts a currently valid annual registration to a seasonal registration, the annual fee prescribed for the vehicle by Chapter 19 (relating to fees) shall be paid in full by the applicant regardless of the number of months chosen for registration by the applicant. Upon receipt of the appropriate fee and the properly completed form, including all information required by this chapter, the department shall issue a seasonal registration that shall expire on the last day of the expiration month chosen by the registrant. No insurer of a vehicle belonging to any owner or lessee who obtains a seasonal registration and who applies for or receives a reduced automobile insurance premium on account thereof shall be required to provide any contractual coverage, whether in the form of the provision of a defense or the payment of first-party or third-party benefits or otherwise, to the owner or lessee in connection with any event occurring during that part of the year in which the vehicle is not registered; and such owner or lessee shall be treated for all purposes, including, without limitation, ascertaining rights to stack coverages and to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, as a person who does not own that vehicle and has no duty to carry financial responsibility on it for that part of the year. (b) New registration.-- A new registration is effective on the date of issuance of a registration card by the department or the date of issuance of a temporary registration card by an authorized agent of the department under section 1310 (relating to temporary registration cards). (c) Renewal of registration.-- A renewed registration shall be effective on issuance by the department of a renewed registration card. (d) Expiration of registration.-- A registration shall expire on the last day of the month designated on the registration card. (e) Antique, classic and collectible vehicles.-- Antique, classic and collectible motor vehicle registrations shall expire upon the salvaging, scrapping or transfer of ownership of the vehicle, except that if the transfer is between spouses or between parent and child the registration may be transferred upon payment of a transfer fee. (f) Optional permanent trailer registration.-- Except as set forth in section 1920(c) (relating to trailers), the registration of trailers permanently registered as provided in section 1920(c) shall expire upon salvaging of the vehicle or transfer of ownership. (g) Election.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a motor vehicle, except a motor vehicle registered under the International Registration Plan and a motor vehicle with a seasonal registration or a circus or carnival plate, may elect to pay an annual registration fee for a two-year period. The fee shall be two times the amount of the registration fee otherwise payable for the motor vehicle under this title.

Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses and may also seek financial compensation for pain and suffering and other nonmonetary damages as a result of injuries caused by other drivers. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"full tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. C. You may contact your insurance agent, broker or company to discuss the cost of other coverages. D. If you wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A, you must sign this notice where indicated below and return it. If you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date E. If you wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B, you may sign this notice where indicated below and return it. However, if you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date (2) Insurers shall print the above notice containing both options on one sheet in prominent type and place in a prominent location. Any person signing, or otherwise bound by, a document containing such terms is bound by such election and is precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed in making the election between full tort or limited tort alternatives. Where there are two or more named insureds on a policy, any named insured may make the full or limited tort election provided for in this section for all named insureds on the policy. (3) If a named insured who receives a notice under paragraph (1) does not indicate a choice within 20 days, the insurer shall send a second notice. The second notice shall be in a form identical to the first notice, except that it shall be identified as a second and final notice. If a named insured has not responded to either notice ten days prior to the renewal date, the named insured and those he is empowered by this section to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. All notices required by this section shall advise that if no tort election is made, the named insured and those he is empowered to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. Any person subject to the limited tort option by virtue of this section shall be precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed. (4) Each insurer, prior to the first issuance of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall provide each applicant with the notice required by paragraph (1). A policy may not be issued until the applicant has been provided an opportunity to elect a tort option. (5) An owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle who does not have financial responsibility shall be deemed to have chosen the limited tort alternative. (6) Nothing in this section changes or modifies the existing requirement that owners of registered vehicles maintain bodily injury and property damage liability insurance arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. (b) Application of tort options.-- (1) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all private passenger motor vehicle policies of the named insured issued by the same insurer and shall continue in force as to all subsequent renewal policies, replacement policies and any other private passenger motor vehicle policies under which the individual is a named insured until the insurer, or its authorized representative, receives a properly executed form electing the other tort option. (2) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all insureds under the private passenger motor vehicle policy who are not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy. In the case where more than one private passenger motor vehicle policy is applicable to an insured and the policies have conflicting tort options, the insured is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the private passenger motor vehicle in which the insured is an occupant at the time of the accident if he is an insured on that policy and bound by the full tort option otherwise. (3) An individual who is not an owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle and who is not a named insured or insured under any private passenger motor vehicle policy shall not be precluded from maintaining an action for noneconomic loss or economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (c) Full tort alternative.-- Each person who is bound by the full tort election remains eligible to seek compensation for noneconomic loss claimed and economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (d) Limited tort alternative.-- Each person who elects the limited tort alternative remains eligible to seek compensation for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. Unless the injury sustained is a serious injury, each person who is bound by the limited tort election shall be precluded from maintaining an action for any noneconomic loss, except that: (1) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election who sustains damages in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person may recover damages as if the individual damaged had elected the full tort alternative whenever the person at fault: (i) is convicted or accepts Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in that accident; (ii) is operating a motor vehicle registered in another state; (iii) intends to injure himself or another person, provided that an individual does not intentionally injure himself or another person merely because his act or failure to act is intentional or done with his realization that it creates a grave risk of causing injury or the act or omission causing the injury is for the purpose of averting bodily harm to himself or another person; or (iv) has not maintained financial responsibility as required by this chapter, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall affect the limitation of section 1731(d)(2) (relating to availability, scope and amount of coverage). (2) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights with respect to claims against a person in the business of designing, manufacturing, repairing, servicing or otherwise maintaining motor vehicles arising out of a defect in such motor vehicle which is caused by or not corrected by an act or omission in the course of such business, other than a defect in a motor vehicle which is operated by such business. (3) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights if injured while an occupant of a motor vehicle other than a private passenger motor vehicle. (e) Nondiscrimination.-- No insurer shall cancel, refuse to write or refuse to renew a motor vehicle insurance policy based on the tort option election of the named insured. Any violation of this subsection shall be deemed a violation of the Automobile Insurance Policy Act. (f) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases when used in this section shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Insured.\" Any individual residing in the household of the named insured who is: (1) a spouse or other relative of the named insured; or (2) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured. \"Named insured.\" Any individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.

(a) Streets deemed to be laid out.-- A street identified in a plan of streets, an official map adopted in accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code or a recorded subdivision or land development plan is deemed to be laid out for purposes of this part. (b) Future street opening.-- A borough has the authority, by ordinance, to lay out an area for future opening as a public street. The proposed ordinance laying out the street must be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for two successive weeks. On or before the publication of the first advertisement, personal notice must be provided to the owners of a property abutting the proposed street or through which the proposed street is to be laid out, and, if the proposed street will lead into an adjacent municipality, a copy of the proposed ordinance must be sent to the adjacent municipality. The proposed ordinance must have appended to the ordinance or referenced a map sufficient to apprise the public of the proposed location, profile and dimensions of the street and must list the names of the owners of a property through which the proposed street has been laid out. (c) Hearing, notice and enactment.-- Within ten days after the second publication of the notice required under subsection (b), an interested party may petition council for a hearing, which council shall hold within 60 days after the date of the petition. Council shall give at least 15 days' notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation and by personal notice to persons entitled to the notice under subsection (b). Council may enact the ordinance no later than 30 days following the date of the hearing or, where no timely petition has been filed, within 30 days of the second publication of the notice required by subsection (b). The enactment of the ordinance constitutes public notice of the borough's intent to recognize the street within the system of borough streets and the borough's rights in the street. Within 30 days of the enactment of the ordinance, a party aggrieved by council's action may appeal to the court of common pleas. (d) Filing of ordinance.-- If, at the time of the enactment of an ordinance in accordance with subsection (c), the lines of the laid out street include property not subject to use as a public passageway, the ordinance must be filed with the recorder of deeds of the county where the borough is located. The recorder of deeds shall index the ordinance by name of borough, name of the property owner and, if applicable, parcel number of the property through which the proposed street is laid out. (e) Landowners.-- If a street has been laid out by ordinance as provided in this section, the owner or subsequent owner has no right to damages for buildings or improvements placed on streets after the date of enactment, and the buildings or improvements must be removed at the expense of the landowner after the opening of the street in accordance with this part. (f) Laying out without opening.-- The laying out of a street, without opening the street, creates no right to public use of the street and does not constitute the taking or acceptance of a property or obligate the borough to improve or maintain the street or the property on which the street has been laid out. (g) Previously laid out streets.-- Nothing in this section may affect the validity or legal effect of a street laid out in accordance with law prior to July 16, 2012. Cross References.

(a) General rule.-- Proof of financial responsibility may be furnished by filing evidence satisfactory to the department that all motor vehicles registered in a person's name are covered by motor vehicle liability insurance or by a program of self-insurance as provided by section 1787 (relating to self-insurance) or other reliable financial arrangements, deposits, resources or commitments acceptable to the department. (b) Nonresident.-- The nonresident owner of a motor vehicle not registered in this Commonwealth may give proof of financial responsibility by filing with the department a written certificate or certificates of an insurance company authorized to transact business in the state in which the motor vehicle or motor vehicles described in the certificate are registered or, if the nonresident does not own a motor vehicle, then evidence satisfactory to the department that the person does not own a motor vehicle. The department shall accept the certificate upon condition that the insurance company complies with the following provisions with respect to the policies so certified: (1) The insurance company shall execute a power of attorney authorizing the department to accept service on its behalf or process in any action arising out of a motor vehicle accident in this Commonwealth. (2) The insurance company shall agree in writing that the policies shall be deemed to conform with the laws of this Commonwealth relating to the terms of motor vehicle liability policies issued in this Commonwealth. (c) Default by foreign insurance company.-- If any insurance company not authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth, which has qualified to furnish proof of financial responsibility, defaults in any undertakings or agreements, the department shall not thereafter accept as proof any certificate of the company whether theretofore filed or thereafter tendered as proof as long as the default continues. (d) Financial responsibility identification cards.-- Insurers shall provide financial responsibility identification cards to insureds which shall be valid only for the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured. If the insured and insurer both agree, the insurer may issue the financial responsibility identification card solely in electronic format. Financial responsibility identification cards shall disclose the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured and shall contain such other information as required by the Insurance Department. In such instance where the insured has financed premiums through a premium finance company or where the insured is on an insurer-sponsored or agency-sponsored payment plan, financial responsibility identification cards may be issued for periods of six months even though such payment by the insured may be for a period of less than six months. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the immediate issuance of financial responsibility identification cards where an insured replaces an insured vehicle, adds a vehicle or increases coverages under an existing policy for which a premium adjustment is required. (e) Immunity.-- If an insured chooses to provide proof of financial responsibility to be viewed in an electronic format on an electronic device pursuant to section 1786 (relating to required financial responsibility), a police officer administering in good faith this subchapter shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability which arises from the insured's choice, including the inadvertent viewing of materials on the device other than the proof of financial responsibility, inadvertent deletion of information from the device, inadvertent interception of a communication while in possession of the device and breakage which occurs to the device.

A (relating to intergovernmental cooperation), boroughs may contract with other municipal corporations providing for the joint construction or maintenance of sanitary sewer systems and for the joint construction onto existing sanitary sewer systems. The agreement shall provide for the apportionment of costs among the municipal corporations. The council may assess the borough's respective portion of the costs, as may be legally assessable, upon property benefited by the facilities pursuant to Chapter 21A (relating to assessments and charges for public improvements). Any portion of the cost not assessed or assessable shall be paid by the respective municipal corporations under the agreement. (b) Composition of joint sanitary sewer board.-- (1) The municipal corporations joining or contemplating joining in any improvement, in order to facilitate the building of the sanitary sewer system and in securing preliminary surveys and estimates, may, by ordinance, provide for the appointment of a joint sanitary sewer board composed of one representative from each of the municipal corporations joining. The board shall act as the advisory and administrative agency in the construction of the improvement and its subsequent operation and maintenance. (2) Members of the joint sanitary sewer board shall serve for terms of six years each from the dates of their respective appointments and until their successors are appointed. The joint sanitary sewer board shall organize by the election of a chair, secretary and treasurer. The secretary and treasurer may be the same person. (3) The municipal corporations may, in the ordinances creating the joint sanitary sewer board, authorize the board to appoint an engineer, a solicitor and other assistants as are deemed necessary and agree to the share of the compensation of those persons each municipal corporation is to pay. (4) The members of the joint sanitary sewer board shall receive compensation for attending board meetings as established in the budget that is prepared by the joint sanitary sewer board and submitted to and adopted by the municipal corporations. The members shall be entitled to actual expenses to be paid by the respective municipal corporations the members represent. (c) Powers of the joint sanitary sewer board.-- (1) The joint sanitary sewer board may adopt rules and regulations consistent with the requirements of this part to govern its proceedings and shall prepare and suggest any practical measures and plans by which the joint improvement may be carried to successful completion and plan the future development of the system, so as to conform to a general plan. (2) The joint sanitary sewer board may prepare a joint agreement or agreements for submission to and adoption by the municipal corporations defining the advisory and administrative powers of the joint sanitary sewer board and setting forth the following: (i) Consents of the municipal corporations to the proposed improvement. (ii) The manner in which preliminary and final plans, specifications and estimates for the proposed improvement shall be prepared and adopted.

(v) All other matters, including the preparation and submission of annual and other budgets, as may be deemed necessary or required by law to complete the proposed improvement and to assure future maintenance and operation thereof. (3) The joint sanitary sewer board may not make any improvement or spend any public money which has not first been authorized by all of the municipal corporations proceeding with the improvement. (d) Eminent domain.-- (1) When it is necessary to acquire, appropriate, injure or destroy private property to build a joint sanitary sewer system or improvement and the property cannot be acquired by purchase or gift, the right of eminent domain shall vest in the municipal corporation where the property is located. (2) When it is necessary to acquire, injure or destroy property in any territory not within the limits of any of the municipal corporations joining in the improvement, the right of eminent domain shall be vested in the municipal corporation adjacent to the territory where the property is located subject to 26 Pa.C.S. § 206 (relating to extraterritorial takings). (3) Damages for any property taken, injured or destroyed shall be assessed under laws relating to the municipal corporation exercising the right of eminent domain and shall be paid by the municipal corporations joining in the same proportion as other costs of the improvements. (e) Indebtedness.-- Each of the boroughs joining in the improvement shall have power to incur or increase its indebtedness, not exceeding the constitutional limits, for the purpose of paying its share or portion of the cost of the improvement in the manner now provided by law for the incurring of indebtedness.",

The amount of the charges shall not be in excess of the estimated amount necessary to maintain and operate the system and to establish a reserve fund sufficient for its future replacement. (4) All sewer rentals or charges imposed by the council against properties connected with a community sewage collection or disposal system under this section shall constitute liens against the properties and may be collected in the same manner as other sewer charges. (5) All money received from the sewer charges shall be deposited as a special reserve fund and shall be used only for the payment of the cost of operating and maintaining the community sewage collection or disposal system and the replacement of the collection or disposal system, if necessary and economically desirable. If, at any time after the acquisition or enlargement of the community sewage collection or disposal system, a regular sewer system is made available by the borough for connection with the properties using the community sewage collection or disposal system, the owners of the properties shall be subject to the other provisions of this part relating to sewers, and all money at that time in the reserve fund which was received from charges for the use of that particular community sewage collection or disposal system and which is over and above the amount expended for the operation and maintenance of that particular community sewage collection or disposal system shall be used towards the payment of any sewer assessments charged against the properties under other sections of this part.

(iii) Bills rendered by a natural gas distribution company on behalf of a natural gas supplier shall include, in a form and manner determined by the natural gas distribution company in consultation with the natural gas supplier, the following information with respect to natural gas supplier services: the name of the natural gas supplier; the rates, charges or prices of natural gas supply services billed, including adjustments to prior period billings, if applicable, and taxes, if applicable; and the natural gas supplier's toll-free telephone number and hours of operation for customer inquiries. (3) Incremental costs relating to billing services designed, implemented and rendered by the natural gas distribution company, at its election, on behalf of a natural gas supplier or other entity may be recovered through fees charged by the natural gas distribution company to the natural gas supplier or other entity. Either party may request that the commission consider the appropriate level of the fee. In doing so, the commission shall consider fees charged by other natural gas distribution companies for similar services. The commission shall either permit the fee to continue as set or shall establish an alternative mechanism to permit full recovery of unrecovered just and reasonable costs from the supplier or the supplier's customers. Nothing in this section shall permit the recovery of such costs from natural gas supply service customers of the natural gas distribution company. (4) If services are provided by an entity other than the natural gas distribution company, the entity that provided those services shall furnish to the natural gas distribution company billing data sufficient to enable the natural gas distribution company to timely bill retail gas customers. The entity shall provide data for billing purposes in a format and in a time frame as required by the natural gas distribution company. The natural gas distribution company shall consider the data and information confidential and shall treat it as such. (5) No natural gas distribution company shall be required to forward payment to entities providing services to customers and on whose behalf the natural gas distribution company is billing those customers before the natural gas distribution company has received payment for those services from customers. The commission shall issue guidelines addressing the application of partial payments. (6) Natural gas distribution companies and natural gas suppliers shall take reasonable steps to allow retail gas customers to contribute via their bill to hardship energy funds which benefit low-income residential retail gas consumers. (7) Natural gas distribution companies shall have the right to recover on a full and current basis all prudent and reasonable costs incurred to implement customer choice from retail natural gas customers or other entities as determined by the commission. Recovery from retail natural gas customers shall be made pursuant to a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments). (d) Enhanced metering.-- Subject to commission approval, the natural gas distribution company may require the installation, at the retail gas customer's expense, of enhanced metering capability sufficient to match the natural gas delivered by the retail gas customer's natural gas supplier or suppliers with consumption by that retail gas customer. In exercising its discretion, the commission shall consider the effect on low-income retail gas customers. (June 23, 2016, P.L.355, No.47, eff. 60 days) 2016 Amendment. Act 47 added subsec. (c)(7).",

(a) Quality.-- A natural gas distribution company shall be responsible for customer service functions consistent with the orders and regulations of the commission, including, but not limited to, meter reading, installation, testing and maintenance and emergency response for all customers, and complaint resolution and collections related to the service provided by the natural gas distribution company. Customer service and consumer protections and policies for retail gas customers shall, at a minimum, be maintained at the same level of quality under retail competition as in existence on the effective date of this chapter. (b) Change of suppliers.-- The commission shall, by order or regulation, establish procedures to ensure that a natural gas distribution company does not change a retail gas customer's natural gas supplier without direct oral confirmation from the customer of record or written evidence of the customer's consent to a change of supplier. (c) Customer information.-- The commission shall, by order or regulation, establish requirements that each natural gas distribution company and natural gas supplier provide adequate, accurate customer information to enable retail gas customers to make informed choices regarding the purchase of all natural gas services offered by that provider. Information shall be provided to retail gas customers in an understandable format that enables retail gas customers to compare prices and services on a uniform basis. (d) Consumer education.-- Prior to the implementation of any restructuring plan under section 2204 (relating to implementation), each natural gas distribution company, in conjunction with the commission and consistent with the guidelines established by the commission, shall implement a consumer education program to inform customers of the changes in the natural gas utility industry. The program shall provide retail gas customers with information necessary to help them make appropriate choices as to their natural gas service. The education program shall be subject to approval by the commission. The consumer education program shall include goals, objectives and an action plan that is designed to be objective, easily understood, utilizes a uniform measurement as established by the commission for the cost of gas, be available in languages that the commission requires to meet the needs of a service territory and be separate and distinct from marketing. (e) Consumer education cost recovery.-- The consumer education program shall be subject to approval by the commission and shall be funded in each natural gas distribution service territory by a nonbypassable, competitively neutral cost-recovery mechanism that fully recovers the reasonable cost of such program. To the extent that the industrial customer class is not currently assigned such costs on the effective date of this chapter, it shall not be assigned such costs in the future. (f) Tenants' rights.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict the rights of tenants pursuant to Subchapter B of Chapter 15 (relating to discontinuance of service to leased premises).

The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) Over the past 20 years, the Federal Government and State government have introduced competition in several industries that previously had been regulated as natural monopolies. (2) Many state governments are implementing or studying policies that would create a competitive market for the generation of electricity. (3) Because of advances in electric generation technology and Federal initiatives to encourage greater competition in the wholesale electric market, it is now in the public interest to permit retail customers to obtain direct access to a competitive generation market as long as safe and affordable transmission and distribution service is available at levels of reliability that are currently enjoyed by the citizens and businesses of this Commonwealth. (4) Rates for electricity in this Commonwealth are on average higher than the national average, and significant differences exist among the rates of Pennsylvania electric utilities. (5) Competitive market forces are more effective than economic regulation in controlling the cost of generating electricity. (6) The cost of electricity is an important factor in decisions made by businesses concerning locating, expanding and retaining facilities in this Commonwealth. (7) This Commonwealth must begin the transition from regulation to greater competition in the electricity generation market to benefit all classes of customers and to protect this Commonwealth's ability to compete in the national and international marketplace for industry and jobs. (8) In moving toward greater competition in the electricity generation market, the Commonwealth must resolve certain transitional issues in a manner that is fair to customers, electric utilities, investors, the employees of electric utilities, local communities, nonutility generators of electricity and other affected parties. (9) Electric service is essential to the health and well-being of residents, to public safety and to orderly economic development, and electric service should be available to all customers on reasonable terms and conditions. (10) The Commonwealth must, at a minimum, continue the protections, policies and services that now assist customers who are low-income to afford electric service. (11) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the electric system, ensure the continued provision of high-quality customer service and avoid economic dislocation, utilities shall consider the experience and expertise of their work force in moving towards competition. (12) The purpose of this chapter is to modify existing legislation and regulations and to establish standards and procedures in order to create direct access by retail customers to the competitive market for the generation of electricity while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system for all parties. Reliable electric service is of the utmost importance to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. Electric industry restructuring should ensure the reliability of the interconnected electric system by maintaining the efficiency of the transmission and distribution system. (13) Under current law and regulation there exists some competition in the wholesale market for the generation of electricity, but the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sale of electricity is provided generally by public utilities under bundled rates regulated by the commission. The procedures established under this chapter provide for a fair and orderly transition from the current regulated structure to a structure under which retail customers will have direct access to a competitive market for the generation and sale or purchase of electricity. (14) This chapter requires electric utilities to unbundle their rates and services and to provide open access over their transmission and distribution systems to allow competitive suppliers to generate and sell electricity directly to consumers in this Commonwealth. The generation of electricity will no longer be regulated as a public utility function except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. Electric generation suppliers will be required to obtain licenses, demonstrate financial responsibility and comply with such other requirements concerning service as the commission deems necessary for the protection of the public. (15) In establishing the standards for the transition to and creation of a competitive electric market, heretofore, public utilities generally have had an obligation to serve customers within their defined service territories; consistent with that obligation, have undertaken long-term investments in generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to meet the needs of their customers; and have entered into long-term power supply agreements as required by Federal law. In many instances, these investments and agreements have created costs which may not be recoverable in a competitive market. The commission is empowered under this chapter to determine the level of transition or stranded costs for each electric utility and to provide a mechanism, the competitive transition charge, for recovery of an appropriate amount of such costs in accordance with the standards established in this chapter. (16) It is in the public interest for the transmission and distribution of electricity to continue to be regulated as a natural monopoly subject to the jurisdiction and active supervision of the commission. Electric distribution companies should continue to be the provider of last resort in order to ensure the availability of universal electric service in this Commonwealth unless another provider of last resort is approved by the commission. (17) There are certain public purpose costs, including programs for low-income assistance, energy conservation and others, which have been implemented and supported by public utilities' bundled rates. The public purpose is to be promoted by continuing universal service and energy conservation policies, protections and services, and full recovery of such costs is to be permitted through a nonbypassable rate mechanism. (18) There are certain changes to a utility which will create transition costs to accomplish the move to a competitive market. These changes may entail the closure of facilities or reduction in employee levels. If such actions are to be undertaken, the utility must fully inform the commission of the impact of such decisions on local communities and on social services and of any tax implications of the actions. The utility is expected to discuss the transition to competition with its employees or their certified representatives and may provide severance, retraining, early retirement and outplacement services. Such transition costs may be recoverable under the competitive transition charge in section 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge). (19) All participants in the restructured electric industry are encouraged to coordinate their plans and transactions through an independent system operator or its functional equivalent. (20) Since continuing and ensuring the reliability of electric service depends on adequate generation and on conscientious inspection and maintenance of transmission and distribution systems, the independent system operator or its functional equivalent should set, and the commission shall set through regulations, inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement standards and enforce those standards. (21) Under Federal and State clean air laws and regulations, electricity generators located in states to the west and south of this Commonwealth are not subject to requirements as stringent as those which apply to generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the act of January 8, 1960 (1959 P.L.2119, No.787), known as the Air Pollution Control Act, operating in this Commonwealth and that different regions within this Commonwealth are subject to varying air emission requirements. Under some scenarios, competition among electricity generators located in different states and different regions within this Commonwealth could make it more difficult for areas in this Commonwealth to demonstrate attainment with Federal and State air quality standards. Since this result may be caused by the disparate requirements imposed by Federal and State law on generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act in this Commonwealth and generators located in other states, the General Assembly supports changes to Federal clean air laws and regulations that will protect Pennsylvania's environment and ensure that electricity generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act located in this Commonwealth are not placed at an undue competitive disadvantage. The commission will consult with the Department of Environmental Protection regarding this issue during the transition to retail competition. Cross References.

(a) Other states.-- The commission shall take all necessary and appropriate steps to encourage interstate power pools to enhance competition and to complement industry restructuring on a regional basis. The Commonwealth, the commission and Pennsylvania electric utilities shall work with the Federal Government, other states in the region and interstate power pools to accomplish the goals of restructuring and to establish independent system operators or their functional equivalents to operate the transmission system and interstate power pools. The commission, Pennsylvania electric utilities and all electricity suppliers shall work with the Federal Government, other states in the region, the North American Electric Reliability Council and its regional coordinating councils or their successors, interstate power pools, and with the independent system operator or its functional equivalent to ensure the continued provision of adequate, safe and reliable electric service to the citizens and businesses of this Commonwealth. (b) Electric cooperatives, municipalities and other electric generation suppliers.-- (1) In order to make the benefits of competition in the generation and sale of electricity as widely available as possible to retail customers and to provide open, fair and nondiscriminatory access to all electric generation suppliers: (i) Consistent with 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 (relating to generation choice for customers of electric cooperatives), no electric cooperative or municipality which distributes electricity to end-use customers may utilize the transmission or distribution system of an electric utility regulated by the commission for the purpose of supplying electricity to an end-use customer unless the electric cooperative or municipality provides open and nondiscriminatory access and allows other electric generation suppliers to utilize its facilities, including any facilities it is entitled to provide to third parties pursuant to contract, to make sales to the end-use customers it serves. A borough may prohibit electric generation suppliers from serving end-use customers within its borough limits; however, such a borough shall be prohibited from providing generation service to end-use customers outside of its borough limits which it did not serve prior to the effective date of this chapter. (ii) The commission shall require any electric cooperative seeking a certificate under 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 to provide open and nondiscriminatory access to its transmission and distribution facilities as a condition to the granting of the certificate. (iii) The reliability of the transmission service provided to electric cooperative corporations must be comparable to the reliability which the transmission supplier provides at the wholesale level. (2) No electric utility regulated by the commission and no affiliate of such electric utility may use the distribution system of another electric utility regulated by the commission or make sales to end-use customers in another electric utility's service territory unless the commission has approved a restructuring plan for the supplying electric utility which provides for direct access comparable to the direct access provided under the approved plan of the electric utility operating the distribution system in the location where the supplying electric utility seeks to sell electricity to an end-use customer. No electric utility regulated by the commission and no affiliate of such electric utility may use the distribution system of an electric cooperative corporation or make sales to end-use customers in the territory of an electric cooperative corporation unless the commission has approved a restructuring plan for the supplying electric utility.

      "text": "§ 2808. Competitive transition charge. (a) General rule.-- To provide each electric utility with an opportunity to recover its transition or stranded costs following the commission's determination under subsection (c), every customer accessing the transmission or distribution network shall pay a competitive transition charge to the electric distribution company in whose certificated territory that customer is located. The costs to be recovered shall be allocated to customer classes in a manner that does not shift interclass or intraclass costs and maintains consistency with the allocation methodology for utility production plant accepted by the commission in the electric utility's most recent base rate proceeding. If a customer installs on-site generation which operates in parallel with other generation on the public utility's system and which significantly reduces the customer's purchases of electricity through the transmission and distribution network, the customer's fully allocated share of transition or stranded costs shall be recovered from the customer through a competitive transition charge. The recovery of transition or stranded costs associated with existing generating facilities is contingent on continued operation at reasonable availability levels of the generation facilities for which recovery has been approved, except when the generation facility is uneconomic on a production cost basis because of the transition to a competitive market. (b) Period for collecting competitive transition charge.-- The competitive transition charge shall be included on bills to customers for a period not to exceed nine years from the effective date of this chapter unless an alternative payment methodology is mutually agreed upon by the customer and the utility or unless the commission in its discretion and for good cause shown orders an alternative payment period. In establishing the length of the period for collection of the competitive transition charge, the commission shall consider the effect on the ability of the Commonwealth to compete in attracting industry and jobs, on the financial health of electric utilities and other relevant factors. (c) Determination of competitive transition charge.-- In determining the level of transition or stranded costs that an electric utility may recover through the competitive transition charge, the commission shall apply the following principles: (1) The commission shall allow recovery of regulatory assets and other deferred charges typically recoverable under current regulatory practice, the unfunded portion of the utility's projected nuclear generating plant decommissioning costs and cost obligations under contracts with nonutility generating projects that have received a commission order. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring an electric utility or a nonutility generating project to enter into an arrangement to buy down, buy out and terminate or otherwise restructure a contract or as authorizing the commission to require a utility to pursue such an arrangement with a nonutility generating project. (2) The commission shall allow recovery of an electric utility's prudently incurred costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation of nonutility generating projects consistent with section 527 (relating to cogeneration rules and regulations). (3) The commission shall determine the level of other generation-related transition or stranded costs that may be recovered through the competitive transition charge. (4) The commission shall consider the extent to which the electric utility has undertaken efforts to mitigate generation-related transition or stranded costs by appropriate means in a manner that is reasonable under all of the circumstances, including consideration of whether mitigation has been commensurate with the magnitude of the electric utility's generation-related transition or stranded costs. During the transition period, electric utilities shall have the duty to mitigate generation-related transition or stranded costs to the extent practicable. Efforts may include the following: (i) Acceleration of depreciation and amortization of existing rate base generation assets. (ii) Minimization of new capital spending for existing rate base generation assets. (iii) Reallocation of depreciation reserves to existing rate base generation assets. (iv) Reduction of book assets by application of new proceeds of any sale of idle or underutilized existing rate base generation assets. (v) Maximization of market revenues from existing rate base generation assets. (vi) Issuance of securitized debt pursuant to the provisions of section 2812 (relating to approval of transition bonds). (5) Of equal importance to the mitigation efforts under paragraph (4), the commission shall consider efforts undertaken over time, prior to the enactment of this chapter, to reduce or moderate customer rate levels while maintaining safe and efficient operations. (d) Commission review.-- As a component of its restructuring plan, each electric utility shall file with the commission a recovery plan, including a proposed competitive transition charge and supporting documentation. In evaluating a recovery plan and any proposed competitive transition charge, the commission shall schedule open evidentiary hearings with proper notice and opportunity for all parties to cross-examine witnesses as necessary. (e) Use of transition bonds.-- After the effective date of this chapter, a utility may apply to the commission for a qualified rate order under section 2812 for some or all of its transition or stranded costs. (1) In evaluating a utility application under this subsection, the commission shall schedule hearings, as necessary. (2) If the commission issues a qualified rate order under section 2812 and if the transition bonds approved by that order are successfully issued, then: (i) the utility shall impose and collect through its customer bills the intangible transition charges approved by that qualified rate order; and (ii) simultaneously, either the utility's rates for electric service or the utility's competitive transition charges shall be reduced by an amount equal to the revenue requirement of the transition or stranded costs for which transition bonds have been successfully issued. (f) Annual revenue.-- Consistent with section 1307(e) (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments), the commission shall establish procedures for the annual review of the competitive transition charge. The review shall reconcile the annual revenues received from the charge with the annual amortization of transition or stranded costs approved by the commission under this section. The commission shall adjust the competitive transition charge based upon underrecovery or overrecovery of the annual amortization amount. Cross References.

(a) License requirement.-- No person or corporation, including municipal corporations which choose to provide service outside their municipal limits except to the extent provided prior to the effective date of this chapter, brokers and marketers, aggregators and other entities, shall engage in the business of an electric generation supplier in this Commonwealth unless the person or corporation holds a license issued by the commission. Consistent with 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 (relating to generation choice for customers of electric cooperatives), electric cooperative corporations must possess a certificate for service to supply generation services beyond their territorial limits. (b) License application and issuance.-- An application for an electric generation supplier license must be made to the commission in writing, be verified by oath or affirmation and be in such form and contain such information as the commission may by its regulations require. A license shall be issued to any qualified applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the service covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing and able to perform properly the service proposed and to conform to the provisions of this title and the lawful orders and regulations of the commission under this title, including the commission's regulations regarding standards and billing practices, and that the proposed service, to the extent authorized by the license, will be consistent with the public interest and the policy declared in this chapter; otherwise, such application shall be denied. (c) Financial responsibility.-- (1) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the generation of electricity in this Commonwealth, no energy supplier license shall be issued or remain in force unless the holder complies with all of the following: (i) Furnishes a bond or other security approved by the commission in form and amount to ensure the financial responsibility of the electric generation supplier and the supply of electricity at retail in accordance with contracts, agreements or arrangements. (ii) Certifies to the commission that it will pay and in subsequent years has paid the full amount of taxes imposed by Articles II and XI of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971, and any tax imposed by this chapter. (iii) Provides the commission with the address of the participant's principal office in this Commonwealth or the address of the participant's registered agent in this Commonwealth, the latter being the address at which the participant may be served process. (iv) Agrees that it shall be subject to all taxes imposed by the Tax Reform Code of 1971 and any tax imposed by this chapter. Failure of an electricity supplier to pay a tax referred to in this paragraph or to otherwise comply with the provisions of this paragraph shall be cause for the commission to revoke the license of the electricity supplier. (2) If an electricity supplier other than an electric distribution company does not pay the tax imposed upon gross receipts under section 1101 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 or this chapter, the electric distribution company to whose retail customer the electricity supplier provided generation service shall remit the unpaid tax, as a tax on the use of electricity in this Commonwealth, to the Department of Revenue and may collect or seek reimbursement of the tax so paid from the electricity provider or any other appropriate party that used the electricity in this Commonwealth. The department shall collect and enforce the use tax herein provided under section 1102 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. Failure of the electric distribution company to pay the amount within 30 days after notice provided by the department shall cause interest to be imposed on the electric distribution company in accordance with Article XI of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. Interest shall be calculated from the 31st day after the department gives the notice required in this paragraph. An electric distribution company or other appropriate person may challenge the imposition of the tax and interest by filing a petition with the department not later than 30 days after the date on which the tax became due. (d) Transferability of licenses.-- No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without prior commission approval. (e) Form of regulation of electric generation suppliers.-- The commission may forbear from applying requirements of this part which it determines are unnecessary due to competition among electric generation suppliers. In regulating the service of electric generation suppliers, the commission shall impose requirements necessary to ensure that the present quality of service provided by electric utilities does not deteriorate, including assuring that adequate reserve margins of electric supply are maintained and assuring that 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service) are maintained. (f) Availability of the services of brokers and marketers or aggregators.-- Prior to approving the licensure of any broker and marketer or aggregator, the commission shall set forth standards to ensure that all retail customer classes may choose to purchase electricity through a broker and marketer or aggregator. The commission shall also ensure that brokers, marketers and aggregators comply with 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56. (g) Annual fees.-- The commission may establish, by order or rule, on a reasonable cost basis, fees to be charged for annual activities related to the oversight of electric generation suppliers.

(a) General rule.-- If, in any borough divided into wards, the council consists of more than seven members, at least 5% of the registered electors of the borough shall have the power to petition council for a decrease in the number of members of council from each ward, except that the council may not consist of less than seven members. The purpose of the decrease may be to achieve any of the following results: (1) A council which is less unwieldy in size. (2) A council which is comparable in size to those in boroughs not divided into wards. (3) A council consisting of an odd number of members instead of an even number. (4) A reduction in borough expenditures. (5) The expedition of the conduct of council meetings. (b) Petitions.-- A petition under subsection (a) shall clearly state whether the petitioners request that the number of members of the council to be elected in each ward shall be reduced from two to one, or from three to two or one, and the reasons why the reduction in number is desired. The petition may state whether it is necessary to add a council member or members to be elected at large in order to achieve or maintain a council consisting of at least seven members or to achieve or maintain a council consisting of an odd number of members. The sufficiency of the number of signers to the petition shall be ascertained as of the date the petition is presented to council. (c) Notice.-- The council shall give notice of the filing of the petition by advertisement in the legal newspaper of the county, if one is published in the county, and in one newspaper of general circulation, and of a day and time for a public meeting. After the public meeting, council may, by ordinance, decrease the number of council members elected from each ward from two to one, or from three to two or one, and may also provide for the election at large of a member or members of council. (d) Terms.-- Council shall, if necessary, establish a schedule for the subsequent at-large election of council members. The schedule may provide that the initial term of one or more of the council members subsequently elected at large shall be reduced to accommodate a schedule of staggered at-large elections to eventually ensure that, as nearly as possible, one-half of the members of council elected at large will be elected at each municipal election. The following shall apply: (1) At each municipal election in the borough, if there are two members from each ward, the electors of each ward shall elect one council member to hold office for a term of four years from the first Monday of January succeeding the election. (2) At each municipal election in the borough, if there is one member from each ward, the electors from each of the odd-numbered wards shall, at the first municipal election, elect one council member for a term of four years, and the electors from each of the even-numbered wards shall elect one council member for a term of two years. At each succeeding municipal election, the electors of the even-numbered wards or odd-numbered wards shall each elect one council member for a term of four years to take the place of those whose terms are about to expire. The council members shall take office on the first Monday of January following their election. (e) Reduction.-- In a borough where, under this section, the number of council members shall be reduced, the council members then in office shall remain in office until the end of their respective terms.",

If the first Monday is a legal holiday, the meeting and organization shall take place the following day. Any action taken by any council at any time between 12:01 a.m. on January 1 of an even-numbered year and the organization of council in that year shall be subject to reconsideration by the new council at any time within ten days after organization. The council may, at the organizational meeting, appoint other officers as may be provided for by law or ordinance, or as may be deemed necessary for the conduct of affairs of the borough, and may transact any other business as may come before the meeting. The president, and, during the president's absence or incapacity, the vice president, shall preside over the meetings of council and perform other duties as are prescribed by this part or by ordinance. (b) Quorum.-- A majority of the membership of council then in office shall constitute a quorum. Except as provided in subsection (c), only council members physically present at a meeting place within the borough shall be counted in establishing a quorum. (c) Telecommunication.-- Council may provide for the participation of council members in council meetings by means of telecommunication devices, such as telephones or computer terminals, which permit, at a minimum, audio communication between locations, if the following apply: (1) A majority of the membership of council then in office is physically present at the advertised meeting place within the borough and a quorum is established at the convening or reconvening of the meeting. If, after the convening or reconvening of a meeting, a member has been disqualified from voting as a matter of law, but is still physically present, council members participating by telecommunication device in accordance with this section shall be counted to maintain a quorum. (2) The telecommunication device used permits the member or members of council not physically present at the meeting to: (i) speak to and hear the comments and votes, if any, of the members of council who are physically present, as well as other members of council who may not be physically present and are also using a telecommunication device to participate in the meeting; and (ii) speak to and hear the comments of the public who are physically present at the meeting. (3) The telecommunication device used permits the members of council and the members of the public who are physically present at the meeting to speak to and hear the comments and the vote, if any, of the member or members of council who are not physically present at the meeting.

(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the protections and prohibitions contained in any law or regulation relating to the rights of the disabled. (d) Voting.-- A member of the council shall not be disqualified from voting on any issue before the council solely because the member has previously expressed an opinion on the issue in either an official or unofficial capacity.

Benefits provided to members of council under section 1202(26) (relating to specific powers) shall not be considered pay, salary or compensation, but payment for all or a part of the premiums or charges for the benefits shall be in accordance with section 1202(26). Any change in salary, compensation or emoluments of the elected office shall become effective at the beginning of the next term of the member of council. (e.1) Alternative compensation.-- Notwithstanding subsection (e), the council may provide that members of the council shall receive compensation on a per-meeting basis based on attendance of members of council. Total annual compensation may not exceed the amounts specified in subsection (e). Compensation shall only be payable for duly advertised public meetings in which a member of council participated, except compensation is not payable if a member of council is absent from a meeting and the absence is not excused. Excused absence from a meeting shall be determined by council and shall include, but not be limited to, an emergency or illness of the member of council or the member's immediate family, as well as family or business travel. Council may require documentation to support an excused absence. (f) Eligibility for compensation.-- The population shall be determined by the latest available official census figures, except that a borough shall not be required to reduce the salary of a mayor or member of council as a result of a decrease in population. In no case shall the compensation for any member of council exceed that of the mayor in any given borough, but, if the mayor's compensation exceeds that authorized by this section for members of council, the president of council may receive compensation not to exceed that of the office of mayor.

      "text": "§ 1705. Election of tort options. (a) Financial responsibility requirements.-- (1) Each insurer, not less than 45 days prior to the first renewal of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall notify in writing each named insured of the availability of two alternatives of full tort insurance and limited tort insurance described in subsections (c) and (d). The notice shall be a standardized form adopted by the commissioner and shall include the following language: NOTICE TO NAMED INSUREDS A. \"Limited Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania give you the right to choose a form of insurance that limits your right and the right of members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses, but not for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages unless the injuries suffered fall within the definition of \"serious injury\" as set forth in the policy or unless one of several other exceptions noted in the policy applies. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"limited tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. B. \"Full Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also give you the right to choose a form of insurance under which you maintain an unrestricted right for you and the members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses and may also seek financial compensation for pain and suffering and other nonmonetary damages as a result of injuries caused by other drivers. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"full tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. C. You may contact your insurance agent, broker or company to discuss the cost of other coverages. D. If you wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A, you must sign this notice where indicated below and return it. If you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date E. If you wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B, you may sign this notice where indicated below and return it. However, if you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date (2) Insurers shall print the above notice containing both options on one sheet in prominent type and place in a prominent location. Any person signing, or otherwise bound by, a document containing such terms is bound by such election and is precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed in making the election between full tort or limited tort alternatives. Where there are two or more named insureds on a policy, any named insured may make the full or limited tort election provided for in this section for all named insureds on the policy. (3) If a named insured who receives a notice under paragraph (1) does not indicate a choice within 20 days, the insurer shall send a second notice. The second notice shall be in a form identical to the first notice, except that it shall be identified as a second and final notice. If a named insured has not responded to either notice ten days prior to the renewal date, the named insured and those he is empowered by this section to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. All notices required by this section shall advise that if no tort election is made, the named insured and those he is empowered to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. Any person subject to the limited tort option by virtue of this section shall be precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed. (4) Each insurer, prior to the first issuance of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall provide each applicant with the notice required by paragraph (1). A policy may not be issued until the applicant has been provided an opportunity to elect a tort option. (5) An owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle who does not have financial responsibility shall be deemed to have chosen the limited tort alternative. (6) Nothing in this section changes or modifies the existing requirement that owners of registered vehicles maintain bodily injury and property damage liability insurance arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. (b) Application of tort options.-- (1) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all private passenger motor vehicle policies of the named insured issued by the same insurer and shall continue in force as to all subsequent renewal policies, replacement policies and any other private passenger motor vehicle policies under which the individual is a named insured until the insurer, or its authorized representative, receives a properly executed form electing the other tort option. (2) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all insureds under the private passenger motor vehicle policy who are not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy. In the case where more than one private passenger motor vehicle policy is applicable to an insured and the policies have conflicting tort options, the insured is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the private passenger motor vehicle in which the insured is an occupant at the time of the accident if he is an insured on that policy and bound by the full tort option otherwise. (3) An individual who is not an owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle and who is not a named insured or insured under any private passenger motor vehicle policy shall not be precluded from maintaining an action for noneconomic loss or economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (c) Full tort alternative.-- Each person who is bound by the full tort election remains eligible to seek compensation for noneconomic loss claimed and economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (d) Limited tort alternative.-- Each person who elects the limited tort alternative remains eligible to seek compensation for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. Unless the injury sustained is a serious injury, each person who is bound by the limited tort election shall be precluded from maintaining an action for any noneconomic loss, except that: (1) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election who sustains damages in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person may recover damages as if the individual damaged had elected the full tort alternative whenever the person at fault: (i) is convicted or accepts Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in that accident; (ii) is operating a motor vehicle registered in another state; (iii) intends to injure himself or another person, provided that an individual does not intentionally injure himself or another person merely because his act or failure to act is intentional or done with his realization that it creates a grave risk of causing injury or the act or omission causing the injury is for the purpose of averting bodily harm to himself or another person; or (iv) has not maintained financial responsibility as required by this chapter, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall affect the limitation of section 1731(d)(2) (relating to availability, scope and amount of coverage). (2) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights with respect to claims against a person in the business of designing, manufacturing, repairing, servicing or otherwise maintaining motor vehicles arising out of a defect in such motor vehicle which is caused by or not corrected by an act or omission in the course of such business, other than a defect in a motor vehicle which is operated by such business. (3) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights if injured while an occupant of a motor vehicle other than a private passenger motor vehicle. (e) Nondiscrimination.-- No insurer shall cancel, refuse to write or refuse to renew a motor vehicle insurance policy based on the tort option election of the named insured. Any violation of this subsection shall be deemed a violation of the Automobile Insurance Policy Act. (f) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases when used in this section shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Insured.\" Any individual residing in the household of the named insured who is: (1) a spouse or other relative of the named insured; or (2) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured. \"Named insured.\" Any individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.

(a) Streets deemed to be laid out.-- A street identified in a plan of streets, an official map adopted in accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code or a recorded subdivision or land development plan is deemed to be laid out for purposes of this part. (b) Future street opening.-- A borough has the authority, by ordinance, to lay out an area for future opening as a public street. The proposed ordinance laying out the street must be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for two successive weeks. On or before the publication of the first advertisement, personal notice must be provided to the owners of a property abutting the proposed street or through which the proposed street is to be laid out, and, if the proposed street will lead into an adjacent municipality, a copy of the proposed ordinance must be sent to the adjacent municipality. The proposed ordinance must have appended to the ordinance or referenced a map sufficient to apprise the public of the proposed location, profile and dimensions of the street and must list the names of the owners of a property through which the proposed street has been laid out. (c) Hearing, notice and enactment.-- Within ten days after the second publication of the notice required under subsection (b), an interested party may petition council for a hearing, which council shall hold within 60 days after the date of the petition. Council shall give at least 15 days' notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation and by personal notice to persons entitled to the notice under subsection (b). Council may enact the ordinance no later than 30 days following the date of the hearing or, where no timely petition has been filed, within 30 days of the second publication of the notice required by subsection (b). The enactment of the ordinance constitutes public notice of the borough's intent to recognize the street within the system of borough streets and the borough's rights in the street. Within 30 days of the enactment of the ordinance, a party aggrieved by council's action may appeal to the court of common pleas. (d) Filing of ordinance.-- If, at the time of the enactment of an ordinance in accordance with subsection (c), the lines of the laid out street include property not subject to use as a public passageway, the ordinance must be filed with the recorder of deeds of the county where the borough is located. The recorder of deeds shall index the ordinance by name of borough, name of the property owner and, if applicable, parcel number of the property through which the proposed street is laid out. (e) Landowners.-- If a street has been laid out by ordinance as provided in this section, the owner or subsequent owner has no right to damages for buildings or improvements placed on streets after the date of enactment, and the buildings or improvements must be removed at the expense of the landowner after the opening of the street in accordance with this part. (f) Laying out without opening.-- The laying out of a street, without opening the street, creates no right to public use of the street and does not constitute the taking or acceptance of a property or obligate the borough to improve or maintain the street or the property on which the street has been laid out. (g) Previously laid out streets.-- Nothing in this section may affect the validity or legal effect of a street laid out in accordance with law prior to July 16, 2012. Cross References. Section 1721.2 is referred to in sections 1712, 1724 of this title.",

A (relating to intergovernmental cooperation), boroughs may contract with other municipal corporations providing for the joint construction or maintenance of sanitary sewer systems and for the joint construction onto existing sanitary sewer systems. The agreement shall provide for the apportionment of costs among the municipal corporations. The council may assess the borough's respective portion of the costs, as may be legally assessable, upon property benefited by the facilities pursuant to Chapter 21A (relating to assessments and charges for public improvements). Any portion of the cost not assessed or assessable shall be paid by the respective municipal corporations under the agreement. (b) Composition of joint sanitary sewer board.-- (1) The municipal corporations joining or contemplating joining in any improvement, in order to facilitate the building of the sanitary sewer system and in securing preliminary surveys and estimates, may, by ordinance, provide for the appointment of a joint sanitary sewer board composed of one representative from each of the municipal corporations joining. The board shall act as the advisory and administrative agency in the construction of the improvement and its subsequent operation and maintenance. (2) Members of the joint sanitary sewer board shall serve for terms of six years each from the dates of their respective appointments and until their successors are appointed. The joint sanitary sewer board shall organize by the election of a chair, secretary and treasurer. The secretary and treasurer may be the same person. (3) The municipal corporations may, in the ordinances creating the joint sanitary sewer board, authorize the board to appoint an engineer, a solicitor and other assistants as are deemed necessary and agree to the share of the compensation of those persons each municipal corporation is to pay. (4) The members of the joint sanitary sewer board shall receive compensation for attending board meetings as established in the budget that is prepared by the joint sanitary sewer board and submitted to and adopted by the municipal corporations. The members shall be entitled to actual expenses to be paid by the respective municipal corporations the members represent. (c) Powers of the joint sanitary sewer board.-- (1) The joint sanitary sewer board may adopt rules and regulations consistent with the requirements of this part to govern its proceedings and shall prepare and suggest any practical measures and plans by which the joint improvement may be carried to successful completion and plan the future development of the system, so as to conform to a general plan. (2) The joint sanitary sewer board may prepare a joint agreement or agreements for submission to and adoption by the municipal corporations defining the advisory and administrative powers of the joint sanitary sewer board and setting forth the following: (i) Consents of the municipal corporations to the proposed improvement. (ii) The manner in which preliminary and final plans, specifications and estimates for the proposed improvement shall be prepared and adopted. (iii) How proposals for bids shall be advertised and contracts awarded. (iv) The manner in which the costs of the improvement and other incidental and preliminary expenses in connection with the improvement and the future cost of operation and maintenance shall be equitably shared, apportioned and paid. (v) All other matters, including the preparation and submission of annual and other budgets, as may be deemed necessary or required by law to complete the proposed improvement and to assure future maintenance and operation thereof. (3) The joint sanitary sewer board may not make any improvement or spend any public money which has not first been authorized by all of the municipal corporations proceeding with the improvement. (d) Eminent domain.-- (1) When it is necessary to acquire, appropriate, injure or destroy private property to build a joint sanitary sewer system or improvement and the property cannot be acquired by purchase or gift, the right of eminent domain shall vest in the municipal corporation where the property is located. (2) When it is necessary to acquire, injure or destroy property in any territory not within the limits of any of the municipal corporations joining in the improvement, the right of eminent domain shall be vested in the municipal corporation adjacent to the territory where the property is located subject to 26 Pa.C.S. § 206 (relating to extraterritorial takings). (3) Damages for any property taken, injured or destroyed shall be assessed under laws relating to the municipal corporation exercising the right of eminent domain and shall be paid by the municipal corporations joining in the same proportion as other costs of the improvements. (e) Indebtedness.-- Each of the boroughs joining in the improvement shall have power to incur or increase its indebtedness, not exceeding the constitutional limits, for the purpose of paying its share or portion of the cost of the improvement in the manner now provided by law for the incurring of indebtedness.",

(ii) More than one-half of the number of owners of properties which are connected with, have a right to use and are using a community sewage collection or disposal system. (2) The borough shall operate and maintain any community sewage collection or disposal system acquired and any enlargement or addition thereto for the use of the following: (i) Persons having acquired from the borough or from the former owner or owners the right to use the system. (ii) Other owners of property accessible to the system up to the capacity of the community sewage collection or disposal system. (3) All persons whose property connects with the community sewage collection or disposal system acquired or constructed by the borough shall pay to the borough treasurer a monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual charge prescribed by a resolution of the council. The amount of the charges shall not be in excess of the estimated amount necessary to maintain and operate the system and to establish a reserve fund sufficient for its future replacement. (4) All sewer rentals or charges imposed by the council against properties connected with a community sewage collection or disposal system under this section shall constitute liens against the properties and may be collected in the same manner as other sewer charges. (5) All money received from the sewer charges shall be deposited as a special reserve fund and shall be used only for the payment of the cost of operating and maintaining the community sewage collection or disposal system and the replacement of the collection or disposal system, if necessary and economically desirable. If, at any time after the acquisition or enlargement of the community sewage collection or disposal system, a regular sewer system is made available by the borough for connection with the properties using the community sewage collection or disposal system, the owners of the properties shall be subject to the other provisions of this part relating to sewers, and all money at that time in the reserve fund which was received from charges for the use of that particular community sewage collection or disposal system and which is over and above the amount expended for the operation and maintenance of that particular community sewage collection or disposal system shall be used towards the payment of any sewer assessments charged against the properties under other sections of this part. (c) Construction.-- Nothing in this section may be construed to supersede the requirements of the act of January 24, 1966 (1965 P.L.1535, No.537), known as the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act.",

Ch. 74 to provide open and nondiscriminatory access to its transmission and distribution facilities as a condition to the granting of the certificate. (iii) The reliability of the transmission service provided to electric cooperative corporations must be comparable to the reliability which the transmission supplier provides at the wholesale level.
