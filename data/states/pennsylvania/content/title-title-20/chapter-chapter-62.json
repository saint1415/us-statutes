      "text": "(a) In general.--A disclaimer relates back for all purposes to the date of the death of the decedent or the effective date of the inter vivos transfer or third-party beneficiary contract as the case may be. The disclaimer shall not in any way diminish the interest of any person other than the disclaimant in such person's own right under the instrument creating the disclaimed interest or under the intestate laws nor diminish any interest to which such person becomes entitled under subsection (b) by reason of the disclaimer.\n\n(b) Rights of other parties.--Unless a testator or donor has provided for another disposition, the disclaimer shall, for purposes of determining the rights of other parties, be equivalent to the disclaimant's having died before the decedent in the case of a devolution by will or intestacy or before the effective date of an inter vivos transfer, or third-party beneficiary contract, except that, when applying section 2104(1) (relating to rules of succession) or analogous provisions of a governing instrument, the fact that the disclaimant actually survived shall be recognized in determining whether other parties take equally or by representation, and except that if, as a result of a disclaimer, property passes to a fund in which the disclaimant has an interest or power which he has not disclaimed, the disclaimant shall retain his interest or power in the fund as augmented by the disclaimed property.\n\n(c) Powers of appointment.--In applying this section to an interest that would have devolved by reason of the exercise of a power of appointment, the person exercising the power shall be regarded as the decedent or transferor, as the case may be.\n\n(d) Rights of creditors of disclaimant.--Nothing in this section shall determine the effect of a disclaimer upon the rights of creditors of the disclaimant.\n\n(Oct. 12, 1984, P.L.929, No.182, eff. imd.; May 16, 2002, P.L.330, No.50, eff. 60 days)\n\n2002 Amendment.Act 50 amended subsec. (a) and added subsec. (d). See section 14(b)(3) of Act 50 in the appendix to this title for special provisions relating to applicability.\n\n1984 Amendment.Act 182 amended subsecs. (a) and (b).",

      "text": "(a) Acceptance.--A disclaimer may be made at any time before acceptance. An acceptance may be express or may be inferred from actions of the person entitled to receive an interest in property such as the following:\n\n(1) The taking of possession or accepting delivery of the property or interest.\n\n(2) A written waiver of the right to disclaim.\n\n(3) An assignment, conveyance, encumbrance, pledge or other transfer of the interest or a contract to do so.\n\n(4) A representation that the interest has been or will be accepted to a person who relies thereon to his detriment.\n\n(5) A sale of the interest under a judicial sale.\n\nTo constitute a bar to a disclaimer, a prior acceptance must be affirmatively proved. The mere lapse of time, with or without knowledge of the interest on the part of the disclaimant, shall not constitute an acceptance.\n\n(b) Partial acceptance within six months.--The acceptance of part of a single interest shall be considered as only a partial acceptance and will not be a bar to a subsequent disclaimer of any part or all of the balance of the interest if the part of the interest is accepted before the expiration of six months from:\n\n(1) the death of the decedent in the case of an interest that would have devolved by will or intestacy; or\n\n(2) the effective date of the transfer in the case of an interest that would have devolved by an inter vivos transfer or third-party beneficiary contract.\n\nIn applying this subsection to an interest that would have devolved by reason of the exercise of a power of appointment, the person exercising the power shall be regarded as the decedent or the transferor, as the case may be.\n\n(c) Partial acceptance after six months.--The acceptance of a part of a single interest after the expiration of such six-month period shall be considered an acceptance of the entire interest and a bar to any subsequent disclaimer thereof but shall not be an acceptance of any separate interest given under the same instrument. In construing this subsection:\n\n(1) income for life or any other period shall be considered a single interest but separate from any interest in the principal or any additional interest in income to take effect upon the happening of a future event; and\n\n(2) an interest in periodic payments to be made from principal or income, or both, for the life of the beneficiary or any other period shall be considered a single interest but separate from any additional payments to be made upon the happening of a future event.\n\n(Oct. 12, 1984, P.L.929, No.182, eff. imd.)\n\n1984 Amendment.Act 182 amended subsec. (b).",
