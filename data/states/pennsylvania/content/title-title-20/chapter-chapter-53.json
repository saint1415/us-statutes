      "text": "(a) Renunciation.--A person nominated under section 5303 (relating to nomination of custodian) or designated under section 5309 (relating to manner of creating custodial property and effecting transfer) as custodian may decline to serve by delivering a valid disclaimer under Chapter 62 (relating to disclaimers) to the person who made the nomination or to the transferor or the transferor's legal representative. If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian able, willing and eligible to serve was nominated under section 5303, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under section 5303. Otherwise, the transferor or the transferor's legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer. In either case, the substitute custodian shall be from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under section 5309(a). The custodian so designated has the rights of a successor custodian.\n\n(b) Designation of trust company or adult as successor custodian.--A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor under section 5304 (relating to transfer by gift or exercise of power of appointment) as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor. If the instrument of designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the resignation of the custodian, the designation of the successor does not take effect until the custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or is removed.\n\n(c) Resignation.--A custodian may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the minor if the minor has attained 14 years of age and to the successor custodian and by delivering the custodial property to the successor custodian.\n\n(d) Ineligibility, death or incapacitation.--If a custodian is ineligible, dies or becomes incapacitated without having effectively designated a successor and the minor has attained 14 years of age, the minor may designate as successor custodian, in the manner prescribed in subsection (b), an adult member of the minor's family, a guardian of the minor or a trust company. If the minor has not attained 14 years of age or fails to act within 60 days after the ineligibility, death or incapacity, the guardian of the minor becomes successor custodian. If the minor has no guardian or the guardian declines to act, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member of the minor's family or any other interested person may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.\n\n(e) Transfer of custodial property and records to successor custodian.--A custodian who declines to serve under subsection (a) or resigns under subsection (c) or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodian, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodian. The successor custodian by action may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.\n\n(f) Removal for cause.--A transferor, the legal representative of a transferor, an adult member of the minor's family, a guardian of the person of the minor, the guardian of the minor or the minor if the minor has attained 14 years of age may petition the court to remove the custodian for cause and to designate a successor custodian other than a transferor under section 5304 or to require the custodian to give appropriate bond.\n\nCross References.Section 5318 is referred to in sections 5301, 5315, 5319 of this title.",
