      "text": "(a) In general.--All income received by a guardian of the estate of an incapacitated person, including (subject to the requirements of Federal law relating thereto) all funds received from the Veterans' Administration, Social Security Administration and other periodic retirement or disability payments under private or governmental plans, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, may be expended in the care and maintenance of the incapacitated person, without the necessity of court approval. The court, for cause shown and with only such notice as it considers appropriate in the circumstances, may authorize or direct the payment or application of any or all of the income or principal of the estate of an incapacitated person for the care, maintenance or education of the incapacitated person, his spouse, children or those for whom he was making such provision before his incapacity, or for the reasonable funeral expenses of the incapacitated person's spouse, child or indigent parent. In proper cases, the court may order payment of amounts directly to the incapacitated person for his maintenance or for incidental expenses and may ratify payments made for these purposes. For purposes of this subsection, the term \"income\" means income as determined in accordance with the rules set forth in Chapter 81 (relating to principal and income), other than the power to adjust and the power to convert to a unitrust.\n\n(b) Estate plan.--The court, upon petition and with notice to all parties in interest and for good cause shown, shall have the power to substitute its judgment for that of the incapacitated person with respect to the estate and affairs of the incapacitated person for the benefit of the incapacitated person, his family, members of his household, his friends and charities in which he was interested. This power shall include, but is not limited to, the power to:\n\n(1) Make gifts, outright or in trust.\n\n(2) Convey, release or disclaim his contingent and expectant interests in property, including marital property rights and any right of survivorship incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety.\n\n(3) Release or disclaim his powers as trustee, personal representative, custodian for minors, or guardian.\n\n(4) Exercise, release or disclaim his powers as donee of a power of appointment.\n\n(5) Enter into contracts.\n\n(6) Create for the benefit of the incapacitated person or others, revocable or irrevocable trusts of his property which may extend beyond his disability or life.\n\n(7) Exercise options of the incapacitated person to purchase or exchange securities or other property.\n\n(8) Exercise all rights and privileges under life insurance policies, annuity contracts or other plans or contractual arrangements providing for payments to the incapacitated person or to others after his death.\n\n(9) Exercise his right to claim or disclaim an elective share in the estate of his deceased spouse and renounce any interest by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer.\n\n(10) Change the incapacitated person's residence or domicile.\n\n(11) Modify by means of codicil or trust amendment, as the case may be, the terms of the incapacitated person's will or of any revocable trust created by the incapacitated person, as the court may deem advisable in light of changes in applicable tax laws.\n\nIn the exercise of its judgment for that of the incapacitated person, the court, first being satisfied that assets exist which are not required for the maintenance, support and well-being of the incapacitated person, may adopt a plan of gifts which results in minimizing current or prospective taxes, or which carries out a lifetime giving pattern. The court in exercising its judgment shall consider the testamentary and inter vivos intentions of the incapacitated person insofar as they can be ascertained.\n\n(July 9, 1976, P.L.836, No.144, eff. imd.; Feb. 18, 1982, P.L.45, No.26, eff. imd.; Apr. 16, 1992, P.L.108, No.24, eff. 60 days; Dec. 16, 1992, P.L.1163, No.152, eff. imd.; May 16, 2002, P.L.330, No.50, eff. 60 days)\n\n2002 Amendment.Act 50 amended subsec.

The court with notice thereof to the institution or person having custody of the incapacitated person may also authorize the guardian or another person to set aside such assets in the form of a savings account in a financial institution which account shall not be subject to escheat during the lifetime of the incapacitated person. Such assets may be disbursed by the guardian or person who set aside such assets or by the financial institution for such funeral expenses without further authorization or accounting.

      "text": "(a) Determination of incapacity.--In all cases, the court shall consider and make specific findings of fact concerning:\n\n(1) The nature of any condition or disability which impairs the individual's capacity to make and communicate decisions.\n\n(2) The extent of the individual's capacity to make and communicate decisions.\n\n(3) The need for guardianship services, if any, in light of such factors as the availability of family, friends and other supports to assist the individual in making decisions and in light of the existence, if any, of less restrictive alternatives. The court shall make specific findings of fact based on the evidentiary record of the absence of sufficient family, friends or other supports and of the insufficiency of each less restrictive alternative before ordering guardianship. Less restrictive alternatives include, but are not limited to:\n\n(i) Advance directives such as durable power of attorney or trusts.\n\n(ii) Living wills.\n\n(iii) Health care powers of attorney.\n\n(iv) Health care representatives.\n\n(v) Financial powers of attorney.\n\n(vi) Trusts, including special needs trusts.\n\n(vii) Representative payees for individuals receiving Social Security benefits.\n\n(viii) Pennsylvania Achieving a Better Life Experience accounts.\n\n(ix) Mental health advance directives.\n\n(4) The type of guardian, limited or plenary, of the person or estate needed based on the nature of any condition or disability and the capacity to make and communicate decisions.\n\n(5) The duration of the guardianship.\n\n(6) The court shall prefer less restrictive alternatives to guardianship and, if no less restrictive alternatives are available and sufficient, limited guardianship. The following apply:\n\n(i) A determination of incapacity is separate from a determination of whether a guardian should be appointed.\n\n(ii) The court may not use a determination of incapacity alone to justify a guardianship.\n\n(iii) The court may not appoint a guardian if a lesser restrictive alternative exists that is sufficient to support the needs of an incapacitated person.\n\n(iv) When entering an order denying a petition for guardianship in whole or in part, the court shall identify the less restrictive alternatives that are available and sufficient to enable the alleged incapacitated person to manage personal financial resources or to meet essential requirements of personal physical health and safety. An order may assist the respondent and any supportive and substitute decision makers involved to effectuate the respondent's decisions with third parties.\n\n(b) Limited guardian of the person.--Upon a finding that the person is partially incapacitated and in need of guardianship services, the court shall enter an order appointing a limited guardian of the person with powers consistent with the court's findings of limitations, which may include:\n\n(1) General care, maintenance and custody of the incapacitated person.\n\n(2) Designating the place for the incapacitated person to live.\n\n(3) Assuring that the incapacitated person receives such training, education, medical and psychological services and social and vocational opportunities, as appropriate, as well as assisting the incapacitated person in the development of maximum self-reliance and independence.\n\n(4) Providing required consents or approvals on behalf of the incapacitated person.\n\n(c) Plenary guardian of the person.--The court may appoint a plenary guardian of the person only upon a finding that the person is totally incapacitated and in need of plenary guardianship services.\n\n(d) Limited guardian of the estate.--Upon a finding that the person is partially incapacitated and in need of guardianship services, the court shall enter an order appointing a limited guardian of the estate with powers consistent with the court's finding of limitations, which shall specify the portion of assets or income over which the guardian of the estate is assigned powers and duties.\n\n(e) Plenary guardian of the estate.--A court may appoint a plenary guardian of the estate only upon a finding that the person is totally incapacitated and in need of plenary guardianship services.\n\n(f) No presumption.--No presumption of incapacity shall be raised from the alleged incapacitated person's institutionalization.\n\n(g) Legal rights retained.--Except in those areas designated by court order as areas over which the limited guardian has power, a partially incapacitated person shall retain all legal rights.\n\n(h) Information as to rights.--At the conclusion of a proceeding in which the person has been adjudicated incapacitated, the court shall assure that the person is informed of his right to appeal and to petition to modify or terminate the guardianship.\n\n(Apr. 16, 1992, P.L.108, No.24, eff. 60 days; Dec. 14, 2023, P.L.446, No.61, eff. 180 days)\n\n2023 Amendment.Act 61 amended subsec.

      "text": "(a) Automatic review.--If the evidence presented during the guardianship proceeding indicates that the circumstances of the person's incapacity may change, the court shall hold a review hearing to determine whether the guardianship continues to be necessary. The court shall set the date for a review hearing under this subsection in the court's order establishing guardianship. The review hearing under this subsection shall be held no later than one year from the date of the order establishing the guardianship. The hearing shall be conducted in the presence of the incapacitated person and the person's attorney, and the court shall adhere to the procedures and standards as outlined in section 5512.1(a) (relating to determination of incapacity and appointment of guardian). If, following the presentation of evidence and testimony from all parties, the court finds that guardianship continues to be necessary and that no less restrictive alternatives exist, the court may order that the guardianship continue. If the court finds that guardianship is no longer necessary or a less restrictive alternative exists, the court shall discharge the guardianship. In determining whether the circumstances of the person's incapacity may change, the court may consider any of the following:\n\n(1) whether the incapacity could be adequately managed by medication, rehabilitation or other means;\n\n(2) whether the potential exists for the incapacitated person to regain physical or cognitive capacity;\n\n(3) the opinion of a medical professional or other qualified expert who has personally examined the incapacitated person;\n\n(4) the circumstances of the incapacitated person's daily living, including, but not limited to, support from others; and\n\n(5) any other factor indicating that the incapacitated person's condition could improve at a future time.\n\n(a.1) Petition for review.--At any time following the issuance of the order establishing guardianship, any interested person may file a petition with the court to terminate or modify the guardianship.
