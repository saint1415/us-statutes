Upon a reconversion, the power to adjust under section 8104 shall be revived.\n\n(g.1) Reconversion from unitrust.--A trustee may reconvert a unitrust following the same procedures as in subsection (a) for converting a trust into a unitrust with the exception that the written notice shall state that the intent is to reconvert the unitrust into a trust for which income is defined under this chapter. Upon reconversion, the power to adjust under section 8104 shall be revived.\n\n(h) Application.--A conversion to a unitrust does not affect a provision in the governing instrument directing or authorizing the trustee to distribute principal or authorizing a beneficiary to withdraw a portion or all of the principal.\n\n(i) Prohibited conversions.--A trustee may not convert a trust into a unitrust in any of the following circumstances:\n\n(1) If payment of the unitrust distribution would change the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets.\n\n(2) If the unitrust distribution would be made from trust funds which are permanently set aside for charitable purposes under the governing instrument and for which a Federal estate or gift tax charitable deduction has been taken, unless both income and principal are so set aside. If both income and principal are so set aside, then section 8113 (relating to charitable trusts) and not this section shall be available.\n\n(i) possessing or exercising the power to convert would cause an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for Federal income tax purposes; and\n\n(ii) the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to convert.\n\n(i) possessing or exercising the power to convert would cause all or part of the trust assets to be subject to Federal estate or gift tax with respect to an individual; and\n\n(ii) the assets would not be subject to Federal estate or gift tax with respect to the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to convert.\n\n(5) If the conversion would result in the disallowance of a Federal estate tax or gift tax marital deduction which would be allowed if the trustee did not have the power to convert.\n\n(6) If the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust.\n\n(j) Permissible conversion when otherwise prohibited.--\n\n(1) If subsection (i)(3), (4) or (6) applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a co-trustee to whom the provision does not apply may convert the trust unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is prohibited by the governing instrument.\n\n(2) If subsection (i)(3), (4) or (6) applies to all the trustees, the trustees may petition the court to direct a conversion.\n\n(k) Release of the power to convert.--\n\n(1) A trustee may release the power conferred by subsection (a) to convert to a unitrust if any of the following apply:\n\n(i) The trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in subsection (i)(3), (4) or (5).\n\n(ii) The trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection (i).\n\n(2) The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.\n\n(July 7, 2006, P.L.625, No.98, eff. 60 days; Oct. 27, 2010, P.L.837, No.85, eff. 60 days)\n\n2010 Amendment.Act 85 amended subsecs.

The policy constituting the election shall be in writing, shall be maintained as part of the permanent records of the trust and shall recite that it constitutes an election to be governed by this section.\n\n(c) Effect of election.--\n\n(1) If an election is made to be governed by this section, the term \"income\" shall mean a percentage of the value of the trust.\n\n(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), the trustee shall, in a writing maintained as part of the permanent records of the trust, select the percentage and determine that it is consistent with the long-term preservation of the real value of the principal of the trust but in no event shall the percentage be less than 2% nor more than 7% per year.\n\n(3) The trustee shall consider the long-term preservation of the real value of the trust assets in selecting a percentage and, as to each charitable organization to which the trustee is required to or may distribute funds, shall consider the organization's need for capital to fulfill its mission and communicate with the organization to make that determination, in selecting a percentage, and may select a percentage as great as 10% per year. This paragraph shall only apply during calendar years 2020, 2021 and 2022, or for the trust's fiscal years that end during those calendar years.\n\n(4) The term \"principal\" shall mean all other assets held by the trustee with respect to the trust. The selection may be made either annually or subject to change only when the trustee deems such change necessary and prudent.\n\n(d) Revocation of election.--The trustee may revoke an election to be governed by this section if the revocation is made as part of an alternative investment policy seeking the long-term preservation of the real value of the principal of the trust.
