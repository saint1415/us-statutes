      "text": "(a) Gifts by will.--A gift of all or part of the body under section 8611(a) (relating to persons who may execute anatomical gift) may be made by will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the testator without waiting for probate. If the will is not probated or if it is declared invalid for testamentary purposes, the gift, to the extent that it has been acted upon in good faith, is nevertheless valid and effective.\n\n(b) Gifts by other documents.--A gift of all or part of the body under section 8611(a) may also be made by document other than a will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the donor. The document, which may be a card designed to be carried on the person, must be signed by the donor in the presence of two witnesses who must sign the document in his presence. If the donor is mentally competent to signify his desire to sign the document but is physically unable to do so, the document may be signed for him by another at his direction and in his presence in the presence of two witnesses who must sign the document in his presence. Delivery of the document of gift during the donor's lifetime is not necessary to make the gift valid.\n\n(b.1) Other means.--An anatomical gift may be made by a statement or symbol indicating that the donor has made an anatomical gift, which shall be recorded in a donor registry or on the donor's driver's license or identification card. If an anatomical gift is indicated on a driver's license or an identification card, the anatomical gift is not invalidated by revocation, suspension, expiration or cancellation of:\n\n(1) the driver's license under 75 Pa.C.S. Ch. 15 (relating to licensing of drivers); or\n\n(2) the identification card by the Department of Transportation.\n\n(c) Specified and unspecified donees.--The gift may be made to a specified donee or without specifying a donee. If the latter, the gift may be accepted by the attending physician as donee upon or following death. If the gift is made to a specified donee who is not available at the time and place of death, the attending physician upon or following death, in the absence of any expressed indication that the donor desired otherwise, may accept the gift as donee. The physician who becomes a donee under this subsection shall not participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part.\n\n(d) Designation of person to carry out procedures.--(Deleted by amendment).\n\n(d.1) Reliance.--Subject to the provisions of section 8616(c) (relating to rights and duties at death), a person may rely on a document of gift or amendment to a document of gift as being valid unless that person knows that the document of gift was not validly executed or was revoked.\n\n(e) Consent not necessary.--\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a donor's gift of all or any part of the donor's body, including a designation in a registry on a driver's license or identification card, donor card, advance health care directive, will or other document of gift, may not be revoked by the next of kin or other persons identified in section 8611(b). The consent of any person at the time of the donor's death or immediately thereafter is not necessary to render the gift valid and effective. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit the donation of a vascularized composite allograft.\n\n(2) An agent, only if expressly authorized in writing in a power of attorney, advance health care directive, health care power of attorney or other document to override the decedent's instructions on the making of an anatomical gift, may revoke the decedent's gift. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit the donation of a vascularized composite allograft.\n\n(f) Documentation of gifts by others.--Any gift by a person designated in section 8611(b) shall be made by a document signed by him or made by his telegraphic, recorded telephonic or other recorded message.\n\n(g) Validity.--A document of gift is valid if executed in accordance with:\n\n(1) this subchapter;\n\n(2) the law of the state or country where it was executed; or\n\n(3) the law of the state or country where, at the time of execution of the document of gift, the person making the anatomical gift:\n\n(i) is domiciled;\n\n(ii) has a place of residence; or\n\n(iii) is a citizen.\n\n(h) Choice of law.--If a document of gift is valid under this section, the law of this Commonwealth governs interpretation of the document.\n\n(i) Rights and protections for certain individuals.--\n\n(1) An individual who is in need of an anatomical gift shall not be deemed ineligible to receive an anatomical gift solely because of the individual's physical or mental disability, except to the extent that the physical or mental disability has been found by a physician or surgeon following an individualized evaluation of the individual to be medically significant to the provision of the anatomical gift. If an individual has the necessary support system to assist the individual in complying with posttransplant medical requirements, an individual's inability to independently comply with those requirements shall not be deemed to be medically significant.\n\n(2) As used in this subsection, \"disability\" shall have the same meaning as in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327).\n\n(Oct. 23, 2018, P.L.594, No.90)\n\n2018 Amendment.Act 90 amended subsec. (e), added subsecs. (b.1), (d.1), (g), (h) and (i) and deleted subsec. (d). Section 11(1)(ii) of Act 90 provided that the addition of subsec.

After removal of the part, custody of the remainder of the body vests in the surviving spouse, next of kin or other persons under obligation to dispose of the body.\n\n(b) Physicians.--The time of death shall be determined by a physician who tends the donor at his death or, if none, the physician who certifies the death.\n\n(c) Certain liability limited.--The following shall apply:\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a person who acts in good faith in accordance with the terms of this subchapter or with the anatomical gift laws of another state or a foreign country shall not be liable for damages in any civil action or subject to prosecution in any criminal proceeding for the person's act.\n\n(2) The immunity from civil liability provided under paragraph (1) shall not extend to acts or omissions resulting from gross negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct of the person.\n\n(3) Neither a person making an anatomical gift nor a donor's estate shall be liable for injury or damage that results from the making or use of the anatomical gift. In determining whether an anatomical gift has been made, amended or revoked under this subchapter, a person may rely upon representations of an individual listed in section 8611(b) regarding the individual's relationship to the donor or decedent unless the person knows that the representation is untrue.\n\n(d) Law on autopsies applicable.--Subject to the provisions of section 8626 (relating to facilitation of anatomical gift from decedent whose death is under investigation), the provisions of this subchapter are subject to the laws of this Commonwealth prescribing powers and duties with respect to autopsies. Notwithstanding 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 91 (relating to criminal history record information), an organ procurement organization is authorized to obtain a copy of an autopsy report in a timely fashion upon request and payment of reasonable copying fees.\n\n(Oct. 23, 2018, P.L.594, No.90)\n\n2018 Amendment.Act 90 amended subsecs.

The notification shall be made without regard to whether the person has executed an advance health care directive.\n\n(b) Referrals.--If an organ procurement organization receives a referral of an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital, the organ procurement organization shall make a reasonable search of the records of the Donate Life PA Registry or the applicable State donor registry that the organ procurement organization knows exists for the geographic area in which the individual resided or resides in order to ascertain whether the individual has made an anatomical gift.\n\n(c) Document of gift.--\n\n(1) If the individual whose death is imminent or has died in the hospital has a document of gift which authorizes an anatomical donation, including registration with the Donate Life PA Registry, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall attempt to notify a person listed in section 8611(b) (relating to persons who may execute anatomical gift) of the gift.\n\n(2) If no document of gift is known to the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor, then the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall ask the persons listed in section 8611(b) whether the individual had a validly executed document of gift. If there is no evidence of an anatomical gift by the individual, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall notify a person listed in section 8611(b) of the option to donate organs and tissues. The notification shall be performed in accordance with a protocol that encourages discretion and sensitivity to family circumstances in all discussions regarding donations of organs and tissues. The protocol shall take into account the individual's religious beliefs or nonsuitability for organ and tissue donation.\n\n(3) The hospital administrator or the hospital administrator's designated representative shall indicate in the medical record of the individual the information under this paragraph. The information shall also be communicated by the hospital administrator or the hospital administrator's designee to the organ procurement organization or designated requestor, as appropriate:\n\n(i) whether or not a document of gift is known to exist and whether a gift was made;\n\n(ii) if a gift was made, the name of the person granting the gift and that person's relationship to the individual; and\n\n(iii) all of the following:\n\n(A) Whether the individual executed an advance health care directive, living will, power of attorney, health care power of attorney, will or other document, including a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, evidencing an intention to limit, withdraw or withhold life-sustaining measures.\n\n(B) Whether the individual indicated in an advance health care directive, living will, power of attorney, health care power of attorney, will or other document an intention to limit the anatomical gifts of the individual in any way, including the intention to limit an anatomical gift to parts of the body which do not require a ventilator or other life-sustaining measures, or to deny making or refusing to make an anatomical gift.\n\n(C) Whether the individual amended or revoked an anatomical gift in any document specified in this subparagraph or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615 (relating to amendment or revocation of gift).\n\n(d) Testing.--\n\n(1) This subsection shall apply if:\n\n(i) a hospital refers an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital to an organ procurement organization;\n\n(ii) the organ procurement organization, in consultation with the individual's attending physician or a designee, determines, based upon a medical record review and other information supplied by the individual's attending physician or a designee, that the individual may be a prospective donor; and\n\n(iii) the individual has not:\n\n(A) indicated in an advance health care directive, a living will, power of attorney, health care power of attorney, will, DNR order or other document an intention to either limit the anatomical gifts of the individual to parts of the body which do not require a ventilator or other life-sustaining measures or indicated an intention to deny making or refusing to make an anatomical gift; or\n\n(B) amended or revoked an anatomical gift in any document specified in subsection (c)(3) or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615.\n\n(2) If the requirements of paragraph (1) are met, the following shall apply:\n\n(i) Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (c)(3), the organ procurement organization may conduct a blood or tissue test or minimally invasive examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of a part that is or may be the subject of an anatomical gift. Testing and examination under this subparagraph shall comply with a denial or refusal to make an anatomical gift or any limitation expressed by the individual with respect to the part of the body to donate or a limitation in the provision of a ventilator or other life-sustaining measures, as specified in subsection (c)(3) or a revocation or amendment to an anatomical gift as specified in a document in subsection (c)(3) or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615. The results of tests and examinations under this subparagraph shall be used or disclosed only:\n\n(A) to evaluate medical suitability for donation and to facilitate the donation process; and\n\n(B) as required or permitted by law.\n\n(ii) Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (c)(3), the hospital may not withdraw any measures which are necessary to maintain the medical suitability of the part until the organ procurement organization or designated requestor, as appropriate, has had the opportunity to advise the applicable persons as set forth in section 8611(b) of the option to make an anatomical gift and has received or been denied authorization to proceed with recovery of the part.\n\n(3) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(4) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(e) Testing after death.--Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (c)(3), after an individual's death, a person to whom an anatomical gift may pass under section 8612 (relating to persons who may become donees; purposes for which anatomical gifts may be made) may conduct a test or examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose.\n\n(1) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(2) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(3) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(4) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(f) Guidelines.--\n\n(1) The Department of Health, in consultation with organ procurement organizations, tissue procurement providers and the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, donor recipients and family appointed pursuant to section 8622(c)(3) (relating to The Governor Robert P.

This subsection includes medical, dental and other health-related records.\n\n(f.2) Recipients.--\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, the rights of the person to whom a part passes under section 8612 shall be superior to the rights of all others with respect to the part. The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part.\n\n(2) Subject to the wishes of the individual under subsection (c)(3) and this subchapter, a person that accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial or cremation and the use of remains in a funeral service.

For an organ procurement organization to be selected under this subparagraph, the organization must not operate nor have an ownership interest in an entity which provides all of the functions of a tissue procurement provider.\n\n(ii) If there is no valid selection under subparagraph (i) or if the organization selected under subparagraph (i) is unwilling to carry out the review, the department shall select to carry out the review any other Commonwealth-licensed organ procurement organization. For an organ procurement organization to be selected under this subparagraph, the organization must not operate nor have an ownership interest in an entity which provides all of the functions of a tissue procurement provider.\n\n(iii) If there is no valid selection under subparagraph (ii) or if the organization selected under subparagraph (ii) is unwilling to carry out the review, the department shall carry out the review using trained department personnel.\n\n(3) There shall be no cost assessed against a hospital for a review under this subsection.\n\n(4) If the department finds, on the basis of a review under this subsection, that a hospital is not in compliance with subsection (a), the department may impose an administrative fine of up to $500 for each instance of noncompliance.

      "text": "(a) General rule.--The Department of Transportation shall redesign the driver's license and identification card application system to process requests for information regarding consent of the individual to organ or tissue donation. The following question shall be asked on both the application for a driver's license or identification card and on the organ donor designation at a photo center:\n\nPennsylvania strongly supports organ and tissue donation because of its life-saving and life-enhancing opportunities.\n\nDo you wish to have the organ donor designation printed on your driver's license?\n\nOnly an affirmative response of an individual shall be noted on the front of the driver's license or identification card and shall clearly indicate the individual's intent to donate his organs or tissue. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a donation of a hand, facial tissue, limb or other vascularized composite allograft. The Department of Transportation shall record and store all donor designations in the Donate Life PA Registry. Subject to an individual's wishes as expressed in a document listed under sections 8613(e)(2) (relating to manner of executing anatomical gifts) and to the individual's wishes under section 8617(c)(3) (relating to requests for anatomical gifts), the recorded and stored designation is sufficient to satisfy all requirements for consent to organ and tissue donation. The recorded and stored designation is not a public record subject to disclosure as defined in section 102 of the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law.\n\n(a.1) Informational insert.--The following apply:\n\n(1) Within 180 days of the effective date of this subsection, the Department of Transportation shall furnish an informational insert about organ donation, tissue donation and donation of vascularized composite allografts to each holder of a driver's license or identification card when the department mails a camera card to the holder at the time of renewal.\n\n(2) The informational insert shall explain:\n\n(i) that under Pennsylvania law, donation of organs, tissues and vascularized composite allografts is a voluntary act;\n\n(ii) the difference between organs, tissues and vascularized composite allografts;\n\n(iii) that under Pennsylvania law, explicit and specific consent is needed to donate a vascularized composite allograft;\n\n(iv) that under Pennsylvania law, the request for a vascularized composite allograft must be made separately from a request for organs and tissues;\n\n(v) that the organ donor designation on the driver's license authorizes the individual to donate organs and tissue and does not authorize the individual to donate a vascularized composite allograft;\n\n(vi) that more information about organ donation, tissue donation and donation of vascularized composite allografts, including information about the procedure for recovering organs and other parts of the body and information about being declared dead through brain death and dead by lack of cardiac function, can be found on the Department of Transportation's publicly accessible Internet website; and\n\n(vii) that, before deciding whether to have an organ donor designation placed on the driver's license, the individual may consult with the individual's physician, attorney or clergy.\n\n(3) The Governor Robert P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Trust Fund shall reimburse the Department of Transportation for the costs incurred in the development and implementation of the informational insert program.\n\n(b) Electronic access.--The organ procurement organizations designated by the Federal Government in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of the nationwide organ procurement network shall be given 24-hour-a-day electronic access to information necessary to confirm an individual's organ donor status through the Department of Transportation's driver licensing database.
