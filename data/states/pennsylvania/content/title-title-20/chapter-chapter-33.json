      "text": "(a) Corporate personal representative.--A bank and trust company or a trust company incorporated in the Commonwealth, or a national bank with trust powers having its principal office in the Commonwealth, may keep investments or fractional interests in investments held by it, either as sole personal representative or jointly with other personal representatives, in the name or names of the personal representatives or in the name of the nominee of the corporate personal representative: Provided, That the consent thereto of all the personal representatives is obtained: And provided further, That all such investments shall be so designated upon the records of the corporate personal representative that the estate to which they belong shall appear clearly at all times.\n\n(b) Individual personal representative.--A personal representative serving jointly with a bank and trust company or a trust company incorporated in the Commonwealth, or with a national bank having its principal office in the Commonwealth, may authorize or consent to the corporate personal representative having exclusive custody of the assets of the estate and to the holding of such investments in the name of a nominee of such corporate personal representative, to the same extent and subject to the same requirements that the corporate personal representative, if it were the sole personal representative, would be authorized to hold such investments in the name of its nominee.\n\n(c) Corporate fiduciary as agent.--An individual personal representative may employ a bank and trust company or a trust company incorporated in the Commonwealth, or a national bank with trust powers having its principal office in the Commonwealth, to act as his agent under a power of attorney in the performance of ministerial duties, including the safekeeping of estate assets, and such agent, when so acting, may be authorized to hold such investments in the name of its nominee to the same extent and subject to the same requirements that such agent, if it were the personal representative, would be authorized to hold such investments in the name of the nominee.\n\n(d) Deposit of securities in a clearing corporation.--A personal representative holding securities in its fiduciary capacity, any bank and trust company, trust company or National bank holding securities as an agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, is authorized to deposit or arrange for the deposit of such securities in a clearing corporation (as defined in Division 8 of Title 13 (relating to investment securities)). When such securities are so deposited, certificates representing securities of the same class of the same issuer may be merged and held in bulk in the name of the nominee of such clearing corporation with any other such securities deposited in such clearing corporation by any person regardless of the ownership of such securities, and certificates of small denomination may be merged into one or more certificates of larger denomination. The records of such fiduciary and the records of such bank and trust company, trust company or National bank acting as an agent under a power of attorney for a personal representative shall at all times show the name of the party for whose account the securities are so deposited. Title to such securities may be transferred by bookkeeping entry on the books of such clearing corporation without physical delivery of certificates representing such securities. A bank and trust company, trust company or National bank so depositing securities pursuant to this section shall be subject to such rules and regulations as, in the case of State chartered institutions, the Department of Banking and, in the case of National banking associations, the comptroller of the currency may from time to time issue including, without limitation, standards for, or the method of making a determination of, the financial responsibility of any clearing corporation in which securities are deposited. A bank and trust company, trust company or National bank acting as custodian for a personal representative shall, on demand by the personal representative, certify in writing to the personal representative the securities so deposited by such bank and trust company, trust company or National bank in such clearing corporation for the account of such personal representative. A personal representative shall, on demand by any party to a judicial proceeding for the settlement of such personal representative's account or on demand by the attorney for such party, certify in writing to such party the securities deposited by such personal representative in such clearing corporation for its account as such personal representative.\n\n(e) Accounting for book-entry securities.--With respect to securities which are available in book-entry form as an alternative to securities in definitive form, the receipt, holding or transfer of such securities in book-entry form by a bank and trust company, trust company or National bank acting as a sole or joint personal representative, or as an attorney-in-fact for a personal representative, is for all purposes equivalent to the receipt, holding or transfer of such securities in definitive form and no segregation of such book-entry securities shall be required other than by appropriate accounting records to identify the accounts for which such securities are held.\n\n(Oct. 10, 1974, P.L.720, No.242, eff. imd.; Nov. 1, 1979, P.L.255, No.86, eff.
