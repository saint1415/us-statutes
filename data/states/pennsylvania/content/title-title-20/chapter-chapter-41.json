      "text": "A foreign fiduciary may institute proceedings in the Commonwealth, subject to the conditions and limitations imposed on nonresident suitors generally, and may exercise all the other powers of a similar local fiduciary, but a foreign personal representative shall have no such power when there is an administration in the Commonwealth. Except in the case of powers with respect to securities and bank accounts, for which special provision is made in section 4102 (relating to powers with respect to securities and bank accounts) the maintenance of a proceeding or the exercise of any other power by a foreign fiduciary shall be subject to the following additional conditions and limitations:\n\n(1) Copy of appointment.--The foreign fiduciary shall file with the register of the county where the power is to be exercised, or the proceeding is instituted, or the property concerning which the power is to be exercised is located, an exemplified copy of his appointment or other qualification in the foreign jurisdiction, together with an exemplified copy of the will or other instrument, if any, in pursuance of which he has been appointed or qualified. When he is an executor, administrator C.T.A., testamentary trustee, or testamentary guardian under a will of a decedent who either died prior to April 1, 1956, or whose will was probated outside of the United States, and wishes to exercise a power with respect to Pennsylvania real estate, the will must be admitted to probate in Pennsylvania as required by law.\n\n(2) Affidavit.--The foreign fiduciary shall execute and file an affidavit with the register of the county where the power is to be exercised or the proceeding is instituted or the property concerning which the power is to be exercised is located, stating that after diligent search and inquiry, the estate of which he is fiduciary is not, to his knowledge or so far as he has been able to discover, indebted to any person in the Commonwealth, and that he will not exercise any power which he would not be permitted to exercise in the jurisdiction of his appointment. The affidavit shall be attached to the copy of appointment.\n\n(3) Time limitation.--When the foreign fiduciary is a personal representative or a trustee under the will of a nonresident decedent, he shall not exercise any of his powers within the Commonwealth for one month after the decedent's death.\n\n(4) Taxes.--When the foreign fiduciary exercises a power to sell or mortgage any Pennsylvania real estate, all taxes due thereon to the Commonwealth or to any subdivision thereof must be paid or provided for.\n\nCross References.Section 4101 is referred to in sections 4102, 4104 of this title.",
