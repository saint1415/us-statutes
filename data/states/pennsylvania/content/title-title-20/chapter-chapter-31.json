The orphans' court division of the county where letters testamentary or of administration have been granted, or should no letters have been granted then of the county within which was the family or principal residence of the decedent, shall have jurisdiction concerning the exemption, whether the real estate is situate in that county or in any other county of the Commonwealth. When real estate is located outside of the county of original jurisdiction, the orphans' court division of the county of original jurisdiction may, in its discretion, direct that an application for the appointment of appraisers shall be made to the orphans' court division of the county in which the real estate is located. The appraisers so appointed shall fix the value of the real estate as of the date of presenting the petition for their appointment and shall receive such compensation as shall be allowed by the court appointing them. Exceptions to appraisements shall be filed with the court of original jurisdiction which may, in its discretion, refer the exceptions to the orphans' court division of the county in which the real estate is located. Upon compliance with such requirements of notice as the court shall direct, the court of original jurisdiction may confirm the appraisement and set apart the real estate to the surviving spouse, child or children, parent or parents entitled thereto.\n\n(b) Real estate valued at more than amount claimed.--When the real estate of the decedent cannot be divided so as to set apart the amount claimed without prejudice to or spoiling the whole or any parcel of it and the appraisers shall value such real estate or parcel thereof at any sum exceeding the amount claimed, it shall be lawful for the orphans' court division of original jurisdiction to confirm the appraisement and to set apart such real estate or parcel thereof for the use of the surviving spouse, child or children, parent or parents, conditioned, however, that the surviving spouse, child or children, parent or parents shall pay the amount of the valuation in excess of the amount claimed, without interest, within six months from the date of confirmation of the appraisement. If the surviving spouse, child or children, parent or parents shall refuse to take the real estate or parcel thereof at the appraisement, or shall fail to make payment as provided above, the court, on application of any party in interest, may direct the personal representative or a trustee appointed by the court to sell the same and the sale in such case shall be upon such terms and security as the court shall direct.\n\n(c) Payment of surplus.--The real estate, if taken by the surviving spouse, child or children, parent or parents, shall vest in him or them, upon his or their payment of the surplus above so much of the exemption as shall be claimed out of the real estate to the parties entitled thereto or to the personal representative of the decedent, as the court, in its discretion, shall direct. If the real estate is sold, so much of the exemption as shall be claimed out of it shall be paid out of the purchase money to the surviving spouse, child or children, parent or parents entitled thereto, and the balance, after payment of costs, shall be distributed to the parties entitled thereto or to the personal representative of the decedent, as the court, in its discretion, shall direct.\n\n(d) Recording and registering decrees.--A certified copy of every decree confirming an appraisement of real estate and setting it apart to the surviving spouse, child or children, parent or parents shall be recorded in the deed book in the office of the recorder of deeds of each county where the real estate shall lie, shall be indexed by the recorder in the grantor's index under the name of the decedent and in the grantee's index under the name of such surviving spouse, child or children, parent or parents, and shall be registered in the survey bureau or with the proper authorities empowered to keep a register of real estate in the county: Provided, That no decree conditioned upon payment of any surplus by the surviving spouse, child or children, parent or parents shall be recorded or registered unless there is offered for recording, concurrently therewith, written evidence of the payment of such surplus.\n\n(e) Costs and expenses.--All costs, appraisers' fees and expenses of recording and registering incurred in claiming the exemption shall be part of the general administration expenses of the estate.",
