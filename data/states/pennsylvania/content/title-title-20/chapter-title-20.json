Customer service and consumer protections and policies for retail gas customers shall, at a minimum, be maintained at the same level of quality under retail competition as in existence on the effective date of this chapter. (b) Change of suppliers.-- The commission shall, by order or regulation, establish procedures to ensure that a natural gas distribution company does not change a retail gas customer's natural gas supplier without direct oral confirmation from the customer of record or written evidence of the customer's consent to a change of supplier. (c) Customer information.-- The commission shall, by order or regulation, establish requirements that each natural gas distribution company and natural gas supplier provide adequate, accurate customer information to enable retail gas customers to make informed choices regarding the purchase of all natural gas services offered by that provider.

      "text": "§ 2802. Declaration of policy. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) Over the past 20 years, the Federal Government and State government have introduced competition in several industries that previously had been regulated as natural monopolies. (2) Many state governments are implementing or studying policies that would create a competitive market for the generation of electricity. (3) Because of advances in electric generation technology and Federal initiatives to encourage greater competition in the wholesale electric market, it is now in the public interest to permit retail customers to obtain direct access to a competitive generation market as long as safe and affordable transmission and distribution service is available at levels of reliability that are currently enjoyed by the citizens and businesses of this Commonwealth. (4) Rates for electricity in this Commonwealth are on average higher than the national average, and significant differences exist among the rates of Pennsylvania electric utilities. (5) Competitive market forces are more effective than economic regulation in controlling the cost of generating electricity. (6) The cost of electricity is an important factor in decisions made by businesses concerning locating, expanding and retaining facilities in this Commonwealth. (7) This Commonwealth must begin the transition from regulation to greater competition in the electricity generation market to benefit all classes of customers and to protect this Commonwealth's ability to compete in the national and international marketplace for industry and jobs. (8) In moving toward greater competition in the electricity generation market, the Commonwealth must resolve certain transitional issues in a manner that is fair to customers, electric utilities, investors, the employees of electric utilities, local communities, nonutility generators of electricity and other affected parties. (9) Electric service is essential to the health and well-being of residents, to public safety and to orderly economic development, and electric service should be available to all customers on reasonable terms and conditions. (10) The Commonwealth must, at a minimum, continue the protections, policies and services that now assist customers who are low-income to afford electric service. (11) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the electric system, ensure the continued provision of high-quality customer service and avoid economic dislocation, utilities shall consider the experience and expertise of their work force in moving towards competition. (12) The purpose of this chapter is to modify existing legislation and regulations and to establish standards and procedures in order to create direct access by retail customers to the competitive market for the generation of electricity while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system for all parties. Reliable electric service is of the utmost importance to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. Electric industry restructuring should ensure the reliability of the interconnected electric system by maintaining the efficiency of the transmission and distribution system. (13) Under current law and regulation there exists some competition in the wholesale market for the generation of electricity, but the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sale of electricity is provided generally by public utilities under bundled rates regulated by the commission. The procedures established under this chapter provide for a fair and orderly transition from the current regulated structure to a structure under which retail customers will have direct access to a competitive market for the generation and sale or purchase of electricity. (14) This chapter requires electric utilities to unbundle their rates and services and to provide open access over their transmission and distribution systems to allow competitive suppliers to generate and sell electricity directly to consumers in this Commonwealth. The generation of electricity will no longer be regulated as a public utility function except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. Electric generation suppliers will be required to obtain licenses, demonstrate financial responsibility and comply with such other requirements concerning service as the commission deems necessary for the protection of the public. (15) In establishing the standards for the transition to and creation of a competitive electric market, heretofore, public utilities generally have had an obligation to serve customers within their defined service territories; consistent with that obligation, have undertaken long-term investments in generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to meet the needs of their customers; and have entered into long-term power supply agreements as required by Federal law. In many instances, these investments and agreements have created costs which may not be recoverable in a competitive market. The commission is empowered under this chapter to determine the level of transition or stranded costs for each electric utility and to provide a mechanism, the competitive transition charge, for recovery of an appropriate amount of such costs in accordance with the standards established in this chapter. (16) It is in the public interest for the transmission and distribution of electricity to continue to be regulated as a natural monopoly subject to the jurisdiction and active supervision of the commission. Electric distribution companies should continue to be the provider of last resort in order to ensure the availability of universal electric service in this Commonwealth unless another provider of last resort is approved by the commission. (17) There are certain public purpose costs, including programs for low-income assistance, energy conservation and others, which have been implemented and supported by public utilities' bundled rates. The public purpose is to be promoted by continuing universal service and energy conservation policies, protections and services, and full recovery of such costs is to be permitted through a nonbypassable rate mechanism. (18) There are certain changes to a utility which will create transition costs to accomplish the move to a competitive market. These changes may entail the closure of facilities or reduction in employee levels. If such actions are to be undertaken, the utility must fully inform the commission of the impact of such decisions on local communities and on social services and of any tax implications of the actions. The utility is expected to discuss the transition to competition with its employees or their certified representatives and may provide severance, retraining, early retirement and outplacement services. Such transition costs may be recoverable under the competitive transition charge in section 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge). (19) All participants in the restructured electric industry are encouraged to coordinate their plans and transactions through an independent system operator or its functional equivalent. (20) Since continuing and ensuring the reliability of electric service depends on adequate generation and on conscientious inspection and maintenance of transmission and distribution systems, the independent system operator or its functional equivalent should set, and the commission shall set through regulations, inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement standards and enforce those standards. (21) Under Federal and State clean air laws and regulations, electricity generators located in states to the west and south of this Commonwealth are not subject to requirements as stringent as those which apply to generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the act of January 8, 1960 (1959 P.L.2119, No.787), known as the Air Pollution Control Act, operating in this Commonwealth and that different regions within this Commonwealth are subject to varying air emission requirements. Under some scenarios, competition among electricity generators located in different states and different regions within this Commonwealth could make it more difficult for areas in this Commonwealth to demonstrate attainment with Federal and State air quality standards. Since this result may be caused by the disparate requirements imposed by Federal and State law on generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act in this Commonwealth and generators located in other states, the General Assembly supports changes to Federal clean air laws and regulations that will protect Pennsylvania's environment and ensure that electricity generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act located in this Commonwealth are not placed at an undue competitive disadvantage. The commission will consult with the Department of Environmental Protection regarding this issue during the transition to retail competition. Cross References.

Standard industry templates may include the EEI Master Agreement for physical energy purchases and sales and the ISDA Master Agreement for financial energy purchases and sales. \"Broker\" or \"marketer.\" An entity, licensed by the commission, that acts as an agent or intermediary in the sale and purchase of electric energy but that does not take title to electric energy. \"Competitive transition charge.\" A nonbypassable charge applied to the bill of every customer accessing the transmission or distribution network which (charge) is designed to recover an electric utility's transition or stranded costs as determined by the commission under sections 2804 (relating to standards for restructuring of electric industry) and 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge). \"Consumer.\" A retail electric customer. \"Customer.\" A retail electric customer. \"Default service provider.\" An electric distribution company within its certified service territory or an alternative supplier approved by the commission that provides generation service to retail electric customers who: (1) contract for electric power, including energy and capacity, and the chosen electric generation supplier does not supply the service; or (2) do not choose an alternative electric generation supplier. \"Direct access.\" The right of electric generation suppliers and end-use customers to utilize and interconnect with the electric transmission and distribution system on a nondiscriminatory basis at rates, terms and conditions of service comparable to the transmission and distribution companies' own use of the system to transport electricity from any generator of electricity to any end-use customer. \"Electric distribution company.\" The public utility providing facilities for the jurisdictional transmission and distribution of electricity to retail customers, except building or facility owners/operators that manage the internal distribution system serving such building or facility and that supply electric power and other related electric power services to occupants of the building or facility. \"Electric generation supplier\" or \"electricity supplier.\" A person or corporation, including municipal corporations which choose to provide service outside their municipal limits except to the extent provided prior to the effective date of this chapter, brokers and marketers, aggregators or any other entities, that sells to end-use customers electricity or related services utilizing the jurisdictional transmission or distribution facilities of an electric distribution company or that purchases, brokers, arranges or markets electricity or related services for sale to end-use customers utilizing the jurisdictional transmission and distribution facilities of an electric distribution company. The term excludes building or facility owner/operators that manage the internal distribution system serving such building or facility and that supply electric power and other related power services to occupants of the building or facility. The term excludes electric cooperative corporations except as provided in 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 (relating to generation choice for customers of electric cooperatives). \"End-use customer.\" A retail electric customer. \"Reliability.\" Includes adequacy and security. As used in this definition, \"adequacy\" means the provision of sufficient generation, transmission and distribution capacity so as to supply the aggregate electric power and energy requirements of consumers, taking into account scheduled and unscheduled outages of system facilities; and \"security\" means designing, maintaining and operating a system so that it can handle emergencies safely while continuing to operate. \"Renewable resource.\" Includes technologies such as solar photovoltaic energy, solar thermal energy, wind power, low-head hydropower, geothermal energy, landfill and mine-based methane gas, energy from waste and sustainable biomass energy. \"Retail customer.\" A retail electric customer. \"Retail electric customer.\" A direct purchaser of electric power.

(v) Other transition costs of the utility, including costs of employee severance, retraining, early retirement, outplacement and related expenses, at reasonable levels, for employees who are affected by changes that occur as a result of the restructuring of the electric industry occasioned by this chapter. The term includes any costs attributable to physical plants no longer used and useful because of the transition to retail competition. The term excludes any amounts previously disallowed by the commission as imprudently incurred. To the extent that the recoverability of amounts that are sought to be included as transition or stranded costs are subject to appellate review as of the time of the commission determination, any determination to include such costs shall be reversed to the extent required by the results of that appellate review. \"Transmission and distribution costs.\" All costs directly or indirectly incurred to provide transmission and distribution services to retail electric customers. This includes the return of and return on facilities and other capital investments necessary to provide transmission and distribution services and associated operating expenses, including applicable taxes. \"Universal service and energy conservation.\" Policies, protections and services that help low-income customers to maintain electric service. The term includes customer assistance programs, termination of service protection and policies and services that help low-income customers to reduce or manage energy consumption in a cost-effective manner, such as the low-income usage reduction programs, application of renewable resources and consumer education.

(a) Limitations upon department.-- Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to authorize, diminish or expand the existing authority of the department, including the Environmental Quality Board, to regulate, control or require permits for the withdrawal or use of water. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to authorize, diminish or expand the existing authority of the department under the act of June 22, 1937 (P.L.1987, No.394), known as The Clean Streams Law. Further, nothing set forth in this chapter, any regulations adopted under this chapter or in the State water plan shall authorize the department to take any action to: (1) Modify or impair any permits, agreements or other approvals issued under other State statutes or vested rights related to water withdrawals or uses. (2) Interfere with or impose additional conditions upon the use or operation of any existing reservoir or water storage facility. (3) Regulate or impose any conditions upon any activity or use not currently authorized under applicable State statutes and regulations. (b) Limitations on water allocation authority.-- The General Assembly reiterates the declarations of other statutes reflecting the need to manage water resources on a watershed basis without respect to political boundaries and the understanding that water management programs should be based upon an accurate and current State water plan. Accordingly, no political subdivision shall have any power to allocate water resources or to regulate the location, amount, timing, terms or conditions of any water withdrawal by any person. (c) Limitations on municipalities.-- Nothing in subsection (b) shall affect the power of any municipality to adopt and enforce ordinances pursuant to 35 Pa.C.S. Pt.

Further, each municipality shall retain and may exercise such authority as conferred by other statutes to adopt ordinances and regulations concerning: (1) mandatory connection to and use of available public water supplies; and (2) the prohibition or regulation of withdrawals from particular sources of water that may be contaminated in order to protect public health and safety from exposure to the contamination or avoid the induced migration of the contamination. (d) Limitations relating to compacts.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede or abrogate any provisions of the act of July 7, 1961 (P.L.518, No.268), known as the Delaware River Basin Compact, or the act of July 17, 1968 (P.L.368, No.181), referred to as the Susquehanna River Basin Compact Law, and this chapter shall be construed in pari materia with such compacts.",

(a) Services.-- (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (2), all construction, reconstruction, repair or work of any nature made by an authority if the entire cost, value or amount, including labor and materials, exceeds $25,000 shall be done only under contract to be entered into by the authority with the lowest responsible bidder upon proper terms after public notice asking for competitive bids as provided in this section. (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to reconstruction, repair or work done by employees of the authority or by labor supplied under agreement with a Federal or State agency with supplies and materials purchased as provided in this section. (3) No contract shall be entered into for construction or improvement or repair of a project or portion thereof unless the contractor gives an undertaking with a sufficient surety approved by the authority and in an amount fixed by the authority for the faithful performance of the contract. (4) The contract must provide, among other things, that the person or corporation entering into the contract with the authority will pay for all materials furnished and services rendered for the performance of the contract and that any person or corporation furnishing materials or rendering services may maintain an action to recover for them against the obligor in the undertaking as though such person or corporation were named in the contract if the action is brought within one year after the time the cause of action accrued. (5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the power of the authority to construct, repair or improve a project or portion thereof or any addition, betterment or extension thereto directed by the officers, agents and employees of the authority or otherwise than by contract. (b) Supplies and materials.-- All supplies and materials costing at least $25,000 shall be purchased only after advertisement as provided in this section. The authority shall accept the lowest bid, kind, quality and material being equal, but the authority shall have the right to reject any or all bids or select a single item from any bid. The provisions as to bidding shall not apply to the purchase of patented and manufactured products offered for sale in a noncompetitive market or solely by a manufacturer's authorized dealer. (c) Quotations.-- Written or telephonic price quotations from at least three qualified and responsible contractors shall be requested for a contract in excess of the base amount of $10,000, subject to adjustment under subsection (c.1), but is less than the amount requiring advertisement and competitive bidding. In lieu of price quotations, a memorandum shall be kept on file showing that fewer than three qualified contractors exist in the market area within which it is practicable to obtain quotations. A written record of telephonic price quotations shall be made and shall contain at least the date of the quotation; the name of the contractor and the contractor's representative; the construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or work which was the subject of the quotation; and the price. Written price quotations, written records of telephonic price quotations and memoranda shall be retained for a period of three years. (c.1) Adjustments.-- Adjustments to the base amounts specified under subsections (a), (b) and (c) shall be made as follows: (1) The Department of Labor and Industry shall determine the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPI-U) for the United States City Average as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2012, and for each successive 12-month period thereafter. (2) If the department determines that there is no positive percentage change, then no adjustment to the base amounts shall occur for the relevant time period provided for in this subsection. (3) (i) If the department determines that there is a positive percentage change in the first year that the determination is made under paragraph (1), the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by each base amount, and the products shall be added to the base amounts, respectively, and the sums shall be preliminary adjusted amounts. (ii) The preliminary adjusted amounts shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a), (b) and (c). (4) In each successive year in which there is a positive percentage change in the CPI-U for the United States City Average, the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by the most recent preliminary adjusted amounts, and the products shall be added to the preliminary adjusted amount of the prior year to calculate the preliminary adjusted amounts for the current year. The sums thereof shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the new final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a), (b) and (c). (5) The determinations and adjustments required under this subsection shall be made in the period between October 1 and November 15 of the year following the effective date of this subsection and annually between October 1 and November 15 of each year thereafter. (6) The final adjusted base amounts and new final adjusted base amounts obtained under paragraphs (3) and (4) shall become effective January 1 for the calendar year following the year in which the determination required under paragraph (1) is made. (7) The department shall publish notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin prior to January 1 of each calendar year of the annual percentage change determined under paragraph (1) and the unadjusted or final adjusted base amounts determined under paragraphs (3) and (4) at which competitive bidding is required under subsection (a) or (b) and written or telephonic price quotations are required under subsection (c), for the calendar year beginning the first day of January after publication of the notice. The notice shall include a written and illustrative explanation of the calculations performed by the department in establishing the unadjusted or final adjusted base amounts under this subsection for the ensuing calendar year. (8) The annual increase in the preliminary adjusted base amounts obtained under paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not exceed 3%. (d) Notice.-- The term \"advertisement\" or \"public notice,\" wherever used in this section, shall mean a notice published at least ten days before the award of a contract in a newspaper of general circulation published in the municipality where the authority has its principal office or, if no newspaper of general circulation is published therein, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the authority has its principal office. (e) Conflict of interest.-- No member of the authority or officer or employee of the authority may directly or indirectly be a party to or be interested in any contract or agreement with the authority for any matter, cause or thing if the contract or agreement establishes liability against or indebtedness of the authority. Any contract or agreement made in violation of this subsection is void, and no action may be maintained on the agreement against the authority. (f) Entry into contracts.-- (1) Subject to subsection (e), an authority may enter into and carry out contracts or establish or comply with rules and regulations concerning labor and materials and other related matters in connection with a project or portion thereof as the authority deems desirable or as may be requested by a Federal agency to assist in the financing of the project or any part thereof. This paragraph shall not apply to any of the following: (i) A case in which the authority has taken over by transfer or assignment a contract authorized to be assigned to it under section 5516 (relating to transfer of existing facilities to authority). (ii) A contract in connection with the construction of a project which the authority may have had transferred to it by any person or private corporation. (2) This subsection is not intended to limit the powers of an authority. (g) Compliance.-- A contract for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, improvement or maintenance of public works shall comply with the provisions of the act of March 3, 1978 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Steel Products Procurement Act. (h) Evasion.-- (1) An authority may not evade the provisions of this section as to bids or purchasing materials or contracting for services piecemeal for the purpose of obtaining prices under the amount required by this section upon transactions which should, in the exercise of reasonable discretion and prudence, be conducted as one transaction amounting to more than the amount required by this section. (2) This subsection is intended to make unlawful the practice of evading advertising requirements by making a series of purchases or contracts each for less than the advertising requirement price or by making several simultaneous purchases or contracts each below that price when in either case the transaction involved should have been made as one transaction for one price. (3) An authority member who votes to unlawfully evade the provisions of this section and who knows that the transaction upon which the member votes is or ought to be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids commits a misdemeanor of the third degree for each contract entered into as a direct result of that vote. (i) Procurement.-- Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or of Title 62 (relating to procurement) to the contrary, an authority shall be considered a State-affiliated entity for purposes of compliance with Title 62. (July 16, 2004, P.L.758, No.94, eff. imd.; Nov. 3, 2011, P.L.367, No.90, eff. imd.) 2011 Amendment . Act 90 amended subsecs. (c) and (h)(1) and added subsec. (c.1).

      "text": "§ 8613. Manner of executing anatomical gifts. (a) Gifts by will.-- A gift of all or part of the body under section 8611(a) (relating to persons who may execute anatomical gift) may be made by will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the testator without waiting for probate. If the will is not probated or if it is declared invalid for testamentary purposes, the gift, to the extent that it has been acted upon in good faith, is nevertheless valid and effective. (b) Gifts by other documents.-- A gift of all or part of the body under section 8611(a) may also be made by document other than a will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the donor. The document, which may be a card designed to be carried on the person, must be signed by the donor in the presence of two witnesses who must sign the document in his presence. If the donor is mentally competent to signify his desire to sign the document but is physically unable to do so, the document may be signed for him by another at his direction and in his presence in the presence of two witnesses who must sign the document in his presence. Delivery of the document of gift during the donor's lifetime is not necessary to make the gift valid. (b.1) Other means.-- An anatomical gift may be made by a statement or symbol indicating that the donor has made an anatomical gift, which shall be recorded in a donor registry or on the donor's driver's license or identification card. If an anatomical gift is indicated on a driver's license or an identification card, the anatomical gift is not invalidated by revocation, suspension, expiration or cancellation of: (1) the driver's license under 75 Pa.C.S. Ch. 15 (relating to licensing of drivers); or (2) the identification card by the Department of Transportation. (c) Specified and unspecified donees.-- The gift may be made to a specified donee or without specifying a donee. If the latter, the gift may be accepted by the attending physician as donee upon or following death. If the gift is made to a specified donee who is not available at the time and place of death, the attending physician upon or following death, in the absence of any expressed indication that the donor desired otherwise, may accept the gift as donee. The physician who becomes a donee under this subsection shall not participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part. (d) Designation of person to carry out procedures.-- (Deleted by amendment). (d.1) Reliance.-- Subject to the provisions of section 8616(c) (relating to rights and duties at death), a person may rely on a document of gift or amendment to a document of gift as being valid unless that person knows that the document of gift was not validly executed or was revoked. (e) Consent not necessary.-- (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a donor's gift of all or any part of the donor's body, including a designation in a registry on a driver's license or identification card, donor card, advance health care directive, will or other document of gift, may not be revoked by the next of kin or other persons identified in section 8611(b). The consent of any person at the time of the donor's death or immediately thereafter is not necessary to render the gift valid and effective. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit the donation of a vascularized composite allograft. (2) An agent, only if expressly authorized in writing in a power of attorney, advance health care directive, health care power of attorney or other document to override the decedent's instructions on the making of an anatomical gift, may revoke the decedent's gift. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit the donation of a vascularized composite allograft. (f) Documentation of gifts by others.-- Any gift by a person designated in section 8611(b) shall be made by a document signed by him or made by his telegraphic, recorded telephonic or other recorded message. (g) Validity.-- A document of gift is valid if executed in accordance with: (1) this subchapter; (2) the law of the state or country where it was executed; or (3) the law of the state or country where, at the time of execution of the document of gift, the person making the anatomical gift: (i) is domiciled; (ii) has a place of residence; or (iii) is a citizen. (h) Choice of law.-- If a document of gift is valid under this section, the law of this Commonwealth governs interpretation of the document. (i) Rights and protections for certain individuals.-- (1) An individual who is in need of an anatomical gift shall not be deemed ineligible to receive an anatomical gift solely because of the individual's physical or mental disability, except to the extent that the physical or mental disability has been found by a physician or surgeon following an individualized evaluation of the individual to be medically significant to the provision of the anatomical gift. If an individual has the necessary support system to assist the individual in complying with posttransplant medical requirements, an individual's inability to independently comply with those requirements shall not be deemed to be medically significant. (2) As used in this subsection, \"disability\" shall have the same meaning as in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327). (Oct. 23, 2018, P.L.594, No.90) 2018 Amendment. Act 90 amended subsec. (e), added subsecs. (b.1), (d.1), (g), (h) and (i) and deleted subsec. (d). Section 11(1)(ii) of Act 90 provided that the addition of subsec.

The duty of the board shall be to reassess the property to reflect the loss in value from the date of the loss to the end of the taxable year. Any property improvements made subsequent to the catastrophic loss in the same tax year shall not be added to the assessment roll for the remainder of that tax year but shall be added for the following year. (b) Refund or credit.-- Any adjustments in assessment under this section: (1) shall be reflected by the appropriate taxing authorities in the form of a credit for the succeeding tax year; or (2) upon application by the property owner to the appropriate taxing authorities, shall result in a refund being paid to the property owner at the time of issuance of the tax notice for the next succeeding tax year by the respective taxing authorities; however, a reduction in assessed value for catastrophic loss due to inclusion or proposed inclusion as residential property on either the National Priority List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-510, 94 Stat. 2767) or the State priority list under the act of October 18, 1988 (P.L.756, No.108), known as the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act, shall be in effect until remediation is completed. (c) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"catastrophic loss\" means any loss due to mine subsidence, fire, flood or other natural disaster which affects the physical state of the real property and which exceeds 50% of the market value of the real property prior to the loss. The term \"catastrophic loss\" shall also mean any loss which exceeds 50% of the market value of the real property prior to the loss incurred by residential property owners who are not deemed responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act and whose residential property is included or proposed to be included as residential property on: (1) the National Priority List by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980; or (2) the State priority list by the Department of Environmental Resources under the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act.

(b) Policy.-- It is the policy of this Commonwealth to publicly announce all requirements for design professional services and to award contracts for design professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the types of services required. There shall be a committee to review the qualifications, experience and work of design professionals seeking contracts with purchasing agencies. (c) Selection committees for Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities.-- Where they are authorized by law to act as purchasing agency for design professional services, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities shall each establish as many selection committees as the department deems appropriate and a procedure for the selection of committee members. (d) Selection committee for all other Commonwealth agencies.-- Except as provided for in subsection (c), all purchasing agencies shall use the selection committee appointed by the Governor which shall be composed of five members, none of whom shall be employees of the Commonwealth or hold any elective office or office in any political party. The members shall be architects, engineers or other persons knowledgeable in construction. The members shall serve for terms of two years and shall not be removed except for cause. Of the original members, three shall serve for terms of two years and two for terms of one year. Thereafter, all terms shall be for two years. Each member shall be reimbursed for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred incident to attendance at meetings and to assigned duties and also a per diem allowance in accordance with Commonwealth travel policies. (e) Procedure for selection committees.-- The selection committees shall use the procedure set forth in this subsection: (1) The committee shall give public notice of projects requiring design services and publicly recommend to the purchasing agency three qualified design professionals for each project. (2) If desired, the committee may conduct discussions with three or more professionals regarding anticipated design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment. The committee shall select, based upon criteria established by the head of the purchasing agency, no less than three design professionals deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. In exercising its responsibility, the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) An equitable distribution of contracts to design professionals. (ii) Particular capability to perform the design or construction services for the contract being considered. (iii) Geographic proximity of the design professional to the proposed facility. (iv) The design professional selected has the necessary available personnel to perform the services required by the project. (v) Any other relevant circumstances peculiar to the proposed contract. (f) Design professionals.-- Except as provided for in subsection (g), the head of the purchasing agency shall select design professionals as follows: (1) Where the amount of the base construction allocation is less than $20,000,000, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The fee to be paid to the appointed design professional may be established by the selection committee or may be negotiated at the discretion of the head of the purchasing agency. The $20,000,000 threshold shall be adjusted by the department to reflect the annual percentage change in the Composite Construction Cost Index of the United States Department of Commerce occurring in the one-year period ending December 31 each year. (2) Where the amount of base construction allocation is in excess of or equal to $20,000,000, as annually adjusted, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee to begin contract negotiations. The fee to be paid to the design professional and the terms of the contract between the design professional and the department shall be negotiated by the head of the purchasing agency. In negotiating the contract and the fee, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, uniqueness and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the appointed design professional, negotiations with that design professional shall be terminated, and the head of the purchasing agency shall commence negotiations with one of the other firms chosen by the selection committee. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the second firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall terminate negotiations with the second design professional and commence negotiation with the third firm. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall choose additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this subsection until an agreement is reached. (g) Selection method for Department of Transportation, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Protection and State-affiliated entities.-- In the event the Department of Transportation, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection or a State-affiliated entity otherwise authorized by law to use its own selection committee requires the services of a design professional, the head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall negotiate with the firm determined to be the highest qualified firm for design professional services at a fee which is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth. In making this decision, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee he determines to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The head of the purchasing agency shall then undertake negotiations with the firm he determines to be the second highest qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the third highest qualified firm. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the committee shall select additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

(2) In performing such duties, the natural gas distribution company shall implement procedures to require all natural gas suppliers to supply natural gas to the natural gas distribution company at locations, volumes, qualities and pressures that are adequate to meet the natural gas supplier's supply and reliability obligations to its retail gas customers and the natural gas distribution company's supply and reliability obligations to its retail gas customers. The procedures shall include, but not be limited to: (i) A communication protocol with natural gas suppliers. (ii) An ability to issue system maintenance orders to control the flow of gas into the distribution system. (iii) The right to issue and enforce penalties pursuant to commission direction, provided, however, that the commission may approve additional procedures of like nature by order or regulation to preserve reliability. (b) Installation and improvement of facilities.-- (1) The natural gas distribution company shall not have an obligation to install nonstandard facilities, either as to type or location, for the purpose of receiving natural gas from the natural gas supplier unless the natural gas supplier or its retail gas customer pays the full cost of these facilities. (2) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the natural gas distribution company from maintaining and upgrading its system to meet retail gas customer requirements consistent with the requirement of section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities) or compliance with other statutory and regulatory requirements. (3) Disputes concerning facilities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission and may be initiated by the filing of a complaint under section 701 (relating to complaints) by the commission or any interested party. (c) Customer billing.-- (1) Subject to the right of a retail gas customer to choose to receive separate bills from its natural gas supplier for natural gas supply service, the natural gas distribution company shall be responsible for billing each of its retail gas customers for natural gas distribution service, consistent with the orders or regulations of the commission, regardless of the identity of the provider of natural gas supply services. (2) (i) Bills to retail gas customers shall contain sufficient unbundled charge information to enable the customer to determine the basis for those charges and shall comply with section 1509 (relating to billing procedures). At a minimum, such charges shall include those services which are unbundled as a result of a restructuring filing or rulemaking. (ii) Bills to retail residential customers rendered by a natural gas distribution company for natural gas distribution services shall include information required by commission regulations governing standards and billing practices for residential utility service.

(3) Incremental costs relating to billing services designed, implemented and rendered by the natural gas distribution company, at its election, on behalf of a natural gas supplier or other entity may be recovered through fees charged by the natural gas distribution company to the natural gas supplier or other entity. Either party may request that the commission consider the appropriate level of the fee. In doing so, the commission shall consider fees charged by other natural gas distribution companies for similar services. The commission shall either permit the fee to continue as set or shall establish an alternative mechanism to permit full recovery of unrecovered just and reasonable costs from the supplier or the supplier's customers. Nothing in this section shall permit the recovery of such costs from natural gas supply service customers of the natural gas distribution company. (4) If services are provided by an entity other than the natural gas distribution company, the entity that provided those services shall furnish to the natural gas distribution company billing data sufficient to enable the natural gas distribution company to timely bill retail gas customers. The entity shall provide data for billing purposes in a format and in a time frame as required by the natural gas distribution company. The natural gas distribution company shall consider the data and information confidential and shall treat it as such. (5) No natural gas distribution company shall be required to forward payment to entities providing services to customers and on whose behalf the natural gas distribution company is billing those customers before the natural gas distribution company has received payment for those services from customers. The commission shall issue guidelines addressing the application of partial payments. (6) Natural gas distribution companies and natural gas suppliers shall take reasonable steps to allow retail gas customers to contribute via their bill to hardship energy funds which benefit low-income residential retail gas consumers. (7) Natural gas distribution companies shall have the right to recover on a full and current basis all prudent and reasonable costs incurred to implement customer choice from retail natural gas customers or other entities as determined by the commission. Recovery from retail natural gas customers shall be made pursuant to a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments). (d) Enhanced metering.-- Subject to commission approval, the natural gas distribution company may require the installation, at the retail gas customer's expense, of enhanced metering capability sufficient to match the natural gas delivered by the retail gas customer's natural gas supplier or suppliers with consumption by that retail gas customer. In exercising its discretion, the commission shall consider the effect on low-income retail gas customers. (June 23, 2016, P.L.355, No.47, eff. 60 days) 2016 Amendment. Act 47 added subsec. (c)(7).",

(d) Consumer education.-- Prior to the implementation of any restructuring plan under section 2204 (relating to implementation), each natural gas distribution company, in conjunction with the commission and consistent with the guidelines established by the commission, shall implement a consumer education program to inform customers of the changes in the natural gas utility industry. The program shall provide retail gas customers with information necessary to help them make appropriate choices as to their natural gas service.

(c) Natural gas distribution company.-- The natural gas distribution company shall deliver natural gas to the extent that it is provided by all natural gas suppliers, or suppliers of last resort, as the case may be, in accordance with the natural gas distribution company's tariff. (d) Standards of service.-- Consistent with the standards set forth in section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities) and applicable orders of the commission, a supplier of last resort under subsection (a)(2)(iii) shall provide sufficient supplies as to quantity, quality, pressure and location to meet the operational reliability requirements of the natural gas distribution company's system, including, but not limited to, a failure of one or more natural gas suppliers to: (1) supply natural gas to their retail gas customers in conformance with their contractual obligations to such customers; or (2) satisfy applicable reliability standards and obligations. (e) Discontinuation of service.-- The natural gas distribution company shall continue providing services as the supplier of last resort to all of its customers for all of the natural gas supply services described in subsection (a)(2) unless, at its discretion, it requests and receives commission approval to discontinue providing one or more such supplier of last resort obligation. In approving such a petition, the commission shall also approve another party as the alternative supplier of last resort for each customer or customer group for which the natural gas distribution company no longer provides such natural gas supply services. (f) Regulations.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations setting forth the standards for approving an alternative supplier of last resort consistent with the provisions of this title, including a mechanism to ensure that the rates charged by any alternate supplier of last resort are just and reasonable. (g) Organized labor.-- During the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, approval of an alternative supplier of last resort pursuant to subsection (e) shall not be granted unless the entity designated by the commission to succeed the natural gas distribution company in the provision of service to these customers agrees to recognize relevant union and collective bargaining agreements of the natural gas distribution company then in place. (h) Petition to become supplier of last resort.-- After the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, any party may petition the commission to become the supplier of last resort to some or all customers except for those customers identified in subsection (a)(2)(i). (i) Notice required prior to market exit.-- (1) A natural gas supplier may not exit the market without providing notice as determined by the commission in the restructuring proceeding of the natural gas distribution company to its customers, the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company. (2) If firm gas supply contracts with Pennsylvania natural gas producers or storage or transportation capacity contracts used by the natural gas supplier to serve such retail gas customers were either assigned or released to the natural gas supplier or constitute capacity which was acquired by the natural gas supplier as the result of nonrenewal of a storage or transportation capacity contract previously held by the natural gas distribution company, the natural gas supplier shall offer the supplier of last resort or successor natural gas supplier a right of first refusal to utilize such Pennsylvania supply contracts or storage or transportation capacity contracts at its contract cost as long as needed to serve those customers. (3) If the storage or transportation capacity contracts held by the natural gas supplier were acquired in another manner, and there was not sufficient notice given to the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company, or if there is not alternative storage or transportation capacity available which is operationally sufficient to serve the market the natural gas supplier was serving, then the supplier of last resort shall be provided with a right to use such storage or transportation capacity as designated by the natural gas supplier, at the contract cost, until the supplier of last resort is able to acquire replacement capacity sufficient to serve its customers using reasonable and diligent efforts to do so. (4) If a dispute arises under this subsection, the aggrieved party may file a complaint with the commission for resolution within 45 days. (j) Duty involving lost customers.-- To the extent that a natural gas supplier loses retail gas customers such that its capacity requirements to a natural gas distribution company are reduced below the level established by the commission for such purpose in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, the natural gas supplier shall have the same obligations set forth in subsection (i). (k) Rate after service discontinued.-- In the event the natural gas supplier discontinues service or defaults before its contract with the customer expires, the retail gas customer shall be served by the supplier of last resort at the commission-approved supplier of last resort rate commencing with the next billing cycle. However, the retail gas customer shall continue to be charged the rate the customer negotiated with the discontinuing or defaulting natural gas supplier for the remainder of the billing cycle. Any difference between the cost incurred by the supplier of last resort and the amount payable by the retail gas customer shall be recovered from the natural gas supplier or from the bond or other security provided by the natural gas supplier without recourse to any retail gas customer not otherwise contractually committed for the difference.

      "text": "§ 2208. Requirements for natural gas suppliers. (a) License requirements.-- No entity shall engage in the business of a natural gas supplier unless it holds a license issued by the commission. To the extent that a natural gas distribution company provides natural gas supply service outside of its chartered or certificated territory, it also must hold a license. A license shall not be required for customers who make de minimis incidental sales or resales to themselves, an affiliate or other nonresidential retail gas customers. (b) License application and issuance.-- An application for a natural gas supplier license shall be made to the commission in writing, be verified by oath or affirmation and be in such form and contain such information as the commission may, by rule or order, require. A license shall be issued to any applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the service covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing and able to perform properly the service proposed and to conform to the applicable provisions of this title and the orders and regulations of the commission, including those concerning standards and billing practices, and that the proposed service, to the extent authorized by the license, will be consistent with the public interest. Otherwise, such application shall be denied. (c) Financial fitness.-- (1) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the natural gas supply service in this Commonwealth, no natural gas supplier license shall be issued or remain in force unless the applicant or holder, as the case may be, complies with all of the following: (i) Furnishes a bond or other security in a form and amount to ensure the financial responsibility of the natural gas supplier. The criteria each natural gas distribution company shall use to determine the amount and form of such bond or other security shall be set forth in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring filing. In approving the criteria, commission considerations shall include, but not be limited to, the financial impact on the natural gas distribution company or an alternative supplier of last resort of a default or subsequent bankruptcy of a natural gas supplier. The commission shall periodically review the criteria upon petition by any party. The amount and form of the bond or other security may be mutually agreed to between the natural gas distribution company or the alternate supplier of last resort and the natural gas supplier or, failing that, shall be determined by criteria approved by the commission. (ii) Provides the commission with the address of the participant's principal office in this Commonwealth or the address of the participant's registered agent in this Commonwealth, the latter being the address at which the participant may be served process. (2) Failure of a natural gas supplier to comply with any provision of this chapter or the rules, regulations, orders or directives of the Department of Revenue or of the commission, including, but not limited to, engaging in anticompetitive behavior, shall be cause for the commission to revoke the license of the natural gas supplier. (d) Transferability of licenses.-- No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without prior commission approval. (e) Form of regulation of natural gas suppliers.-- Except where a natural gas supplier serves as a supplier of last resort, the commission may forbear from extending its regulation of natural gas suppliers beyond licensing, bonding, reliability and consumer services and protections, including all applicable portions of 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service). Subject to the provisions of section 2207 (relating to obligation to serve), nothing in this section shall preclude a natural gas supplier, upon appropriate and reasonable notice to the retail gas customer, supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company, from canceling its contract with any customer for legal cause, subject to the customer's right to have continued service from the supplier of last resort. (f) Availability of the service of natural gas suppliers.-- Prior to licensing any natural gas supplier, the commission shall set forth standards to ensure that all customer classes may choose to purchase natural gas from a natural gas supplier. The commission shall also ensure that natural gas suppliers comply with applicable provisions of 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56. (g) Open and nondiscriminatory access.-- In addition to meeting the license requirements applicable to applicants under subsection (b), a municipal corporation shall, before it is permitted to provide natural gas supply services as a natural gas supplier, demonstrate, and the commission shall determine, that, by the date of the issuance of the license, it will provide other natural gas suppliers open and nondiscriminatory access to its gas distribution system under standards that are comparable to this title, taking into consideration the particular circumstances of the municipal corporation's ownership and/or operation of the gas distribution system. (h) Annual fees.-- The commission may establish, by order or rule, on a reasonable cost basis, fees to be charged for annual activities related to the oversight of natural gas suppliers.

(a) Interim standards of conduct.-- Within 120 days of the effective date of this chapter, the commission shall provide by order binding, interim guidelines for standards of conduct governing the activities of and relationships between natural gas distribution companies and their affiliated natural gas suppliers and other natural gas suppliers and monitor and enforce compliance with those standards. (b) Permanent standards of conduct.-- The commission shall thereupon promulgate regulations setting forth permanent standards of conduct governing the activities of and relationships between natural gas distribution companies and their affiliated natural gas suppliers and other natural gas suppliers and monitor and enforce compliance with these standards. The commission shall neither favor nor disfavor conduct or operations by and between a natural gas distribution company and an affiliated natural gas supplier or a nonaffiliated natural gas supplier. (c) Contents of standards.-- Standards of conduct shall provide for: (1) No discrimination against or preferential treatment of any natural gas supplier, including an affiliated natural gas supplier. (2) No disclosure or preferential sharing of any confidential information to or with any individual natural gas supplier. (3) Adequate rules prohibiting cross-subsidization of an affiliated natural gas supplier by a natural gas distribution company. (4) Maintenance of separate books and records by the natural gas distribution company and its affiliated natural gas supplier. (5) Sufficient physical and operational separation, but not including legal divestiture, to accomplish paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4). (6) An informal dispute resolution procedure. (7) A system of penalties for noncompliance with the final set of standards of conduct consistent with existing commission regulations. (d) Limitation.-- The standards shall not prohibit the natural gas distribution company and its affiliated natural gas supplier from using or sharing similar corporate names, trademarks, trade dress or service marks. (e) Initiation of investigations.-- Upon complaint or upon its own motion, for good cause shown, the commission shall conduct an investigation of the impact on the proper functioning of a fully competitive retail natural gas market of mergers, consolidations, acquisition or disposition of assets or securities of natural gas suppliers and anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct affecting the retail distribution of natural gas. (f) Conduct of investigations.-- (1) The commission may require a natural gas supplier to provide information, including documents and testimony, in accordance with the commission's regulations regarding the discovery of information. (2) Material which the commission determines to be confidential, proprietary or trade secret information provided under this subsection shall not be disclosed to any person not directly employed or retained by the commission to conduct the investigation without the consent of the party providing the information. (3) Notwithstanding the prohibition on disclosure of information in paragraph (2), the commission shall disclose information obtained under this subsection to the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate under an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The commission may disclose the information to appropriate Federal or State law enforcement officials if it determines that the disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent or restrain a violation of Federal or State law and it provides the party that provided the information with reasonable notice and opportunity to prevent or limit disclosure. (g) Referrals and investigation.-- If, as a result of the investigation conducted under this section, the commission has reason to believe that anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, is preventing the retail gas customers from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and effectively competitive retail natural gas market, the commission, pursuant to its regulations, shall: (1) Refer its findings to the Attorney General, the United States Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. (2) Subject to subsection (c)(3), disclose any information it has obtained in the course of its investigation to the agency or agencies to which it had made a referral under paragraph (1). (3) Intervene, as provided and permitted by law or regulation, in any proceedings initiated as a result of a referral made under paragraph (1). (h) Marketing standards.-- As part of each natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, the commission may, in its discretion, develop and apply different standards of conduct to the natural gas distribution company's marketing activities related to natural gas supply services. No such standards shall apply to the natural gas distribution company's marketing division or operations until the commission issues an order in the context of that natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding. (i) Definition.-- Subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (h), for the purposes of this section, the term \"affiliated natural gas supplier\" includes marketing activities related to natural gas supply services by the marketing division or the marketing operation of a natural gas distribution company.",

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided under subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g) and section 2212 (relating to city natural gas distribution operations), for a period from the effective date of this chapter until January 1, 2001, the total nongas cost charges of a natural gas distribution company for service to any retail gas customer shall not exceed the maximum nongas cost charges that are contained in the natural gas distribution company's tariff as of the effective date of this chapter. (b) Recovery of deferred costs.-- (1) In a restructuring proceeding, the natural gas distribution company may identify categories of costs resulting from this chapter. (2) The natural gas distribution company may seek permission in its restructuring proceeding to capitalize and to amortize such costs over an appropriate period to be determined by the commission. The amortization shall commence at the time when restructuring orders are issued. The natural gas distribution company may seek recovery of the unamortized balance of such costs in a future rate proceeding, and the commission shall allow recovery of such costs provided that the commission determines that such costs are reasonable and that the resulting rates are just and reasonable. (c) Deferral of costs.-- Costs recoverable under sections 2203(6) (relating to standards for restructuring of natural gas utility industry) and 2206(e) (relating to consumer protections and customer service) in excess of amounts already reflected in a natural gas distribution company's rates, which are incurred between the date of entry of the commission's restructuring order and the earlier of the date on which the commission authorizes commencement of recovery or June 30, 2002, may be deferred for recovery in the future. Such deferrals shall be without interest. (d) Circumstances for exceptions.-- A natural gas distribution company may seek and the commission may approve an exception to the limitations set forth in this section under any of the following circumstances: (1) The natural gas distribution company meets the requirements for extraordinary relief under section 1308(e) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). (2) The natural gas distribution company demonstrates that a rate increase is necessary in order to preserve the reliability of the natural gas distribution system. (3) The natural gas distribution company is subject to significant increases in the rate of Federal taxes or other significant increases in costs resulting from changes in law or regulations that would not allow the natural gas distribution company to earn a fair rate of return. (e) Interclass and intraclass cost shifts.-- Except as provided in section 2212, for the period from the effective date of this chapter until January 1, 2001, interclass or intraclass cost shifts are prohibited. This prohibition against cost shifting may be accomplished by maintaining the cost allocation methodology accepted by the commission for each natural gas distribution company in the company's most recent base rate proceeding. (f) State tax adjustment surcharge.-- The natural gas distribution company, other than a city natural gas distribution operation, shall remain subject to the State tax adjustment surcharge and shall be permitted to adjust its State tax adjustment surcharge mechanism to reflect State tax changes or additions. The natural gas distribution company shall also remain subject to existing riders or surcharges for the collection of nongas transition costs pursuant to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decisions. (g) Provisions relating to interstate pipelines.-- (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if a natural gas distribution company's current base rate revenues reflect the margins realized through the utilization of firm interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to serve the interruptible market when such capacity is not needed to make firm retail deliveries, then the natural gas distribution company shall be permitted to increase base rates and, at the same time, reduce purchased gas cost rates, as described in this chapter. (2) The natural gas distribution company may propose such a change in treatment, consistent with the following requirements: (i) Base rates of customers who pay purchased gas cost rates pursuant to section 1307(f) (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) shall be increased by an amount equal to the margin received for service provided to existing interruptible sales and transportation service customers using capacity reflected in rates established under section 1307(f) based upon the revenue for such services for the most recent 12-month period immediately preceding the application. (ii) Purchased gas cost rates established pursuant to section 1307(f) shall be decreased by an amount equal to the amount by which base rates are increased in subparagraph (i). (iii) Purchased gas cost rates established pursuant to section 1307(f) shall thereafter be reconciled to reflect the margins realized from interruptible sales and interruptible transportation customers utilizing capacity reflected in rates established under section 1307(f). (h) Interstate pipeline transportation.-- (1) Except as specifically set forth in this subsection, nothing in this section or section 2204(d) (relating to implementation) shall prevent a natural gas distribution company from recovering costs paid under the terms of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts which are not fully recovered through a release, assignment or transfer of such capacity to another natural gas supplier if such unrecovered costs arise under the terms of a natural gas transportation pilot program approved by the commission for such company on or before February 1, 1999. (2) Such unrecovered interstate pipeline transportation and capacity costs incurred under such programs through October 31, 2004, may be recovered from a class or classes of customers in accordance with such program provided that the total volumetric charge for such costs does not exceed 1% of the volumetric charge for residential natural gas sales service set forth in the natural gas distribution company's tariff in effect at the time. (3) With respect to such pilot programs, the commission may determine to extend such programs to include all customers of that company pursuant to the requirements of this chapter, and nothing in this section or section 2204(d) shall prevent unrecovered interstate pipeline and transportation capacity costs incurred through October 31, 2004, under such programs from being recovered in accordance with such programs provided that the total volumetric charge for such costs does not exceed the 1% limit specified in paragraph (2) for pilot programs.",

      "text": "§ 2802. Declaration of policy. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) Over the past 20 years, the Federal Government and State government have introduced competition in several industries that previously had been regulated as natural monopolies. (2) Many state governments are implementing or studying policies that would create a competitive market for the generation of electricity. (3) Because of advances in electric generation technology and Federal initiatives to encourage greater competition in the wholesale electric market, it is now in the public interest to permit retail customers to obtain direct access to a competitive generation market as long as safe and affordable transmission and distribution service is available at levels of reliability that are currently enjoyed by the citizens and businesses of this Commonwealth. (4) Rates for electricity in this Commonwealth are on average higher than the national average, and significant differences exist among the rates of Pennsylvania electric utilities. (5) Competitive market forces are more effective than economic regulation in controlling the cost of generating electricity. (6) The cost of electricity is an important factor in decisions made by businesses concerning locating, expanding and retaining facilities in this Commonwealth. (7) This Commonwealth must begin the transition from regulation to greater competition in the electricity generation market to benefit all classes of customers and to protect this Commonwealth's ability to compete in the national and international marketplace for industry and jobs. (8) In moving toward greater competition in the electricity generation market, the Commonwealth must resolve certain transitional issues in a manner that is fair to customers, electric utilities, investors, the employees of electric utilities, local communities, nonutility generators of electricity and other affected parties. (9) Electric service is essential to the health and well-being of residents, to public safety and to orderly economic development, and electric service should be available to all customers on reasonable terms and conditions. (10) The Commonwealth must, at a minimum, continue the protections, policies and services that now assist customers who are low-income to afford electric service. (11) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the electric system, ensure the continued provision of high-quality customer service and avoid economic dislocation, utilities shall consider the experience and expertise of their work force in moving towards competition. (12) The purpose of this chapter is to modify existing legislation and regulations and to establish standards and procedures in order to create direct access by retail customers to the competitive market for the generation of electricity while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system for all parties. Reliable electric service is of the utmost importance to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. Electric industry restructuring should ensure the reliability of the interconnected electric system by maintaining the efficiency of the transmission and distribution system. (13) Under current law and regulation there exists some competition in the wholesale market for the generation of electricity, but the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sale of electricity is provided generally by public utilities under bundled rates regulated by the commission. The procedures established under this chapter provide for a fair and orderly transition from the current regulated structure to a structure under which retail customers will have direct access to a competitive market for the generation and sale or purchase of electricity. (14) This chapter requires electric utilities to unbundle their rates and services and to provide open access over their transmission and distribution systems to allow competitive suppliers to generate and sell electricity directly to consumers in this Commonwealth. The generation of electricity will no longer be regulated as a public utility function except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. Electric generation suppliers will be required to obtain licenses, demonstrate financial responsibility and comply with such other requirements concerning service as the commission deems necessary for the protection of the public. (15) In establishing the standards for the transition to and creation of a competitive electric market, heretofore, public utilities generally have had an obligation to serve customers within their defined service territories; consistent with that obligation, have undertaken long-term investments in generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to meet the needs of their customers; and have entered into long-term power supply agreements as required by Federal law. In many instances, these investments and agreements have created costs which may not be recoverable in a competitive market. The commission is empowered under this chapter to determine the level of transition or stranded costs for each electric utility and to provide a mechanism, the competitive transition charge, for recovery of an appropriate amount of such costs in accordance with the standards established in this chapter. (16) It is in the public interest for the transmission and distribution of electricity to continue to be regulated as a natural monopoly subject to the jurisdiction and active supervision of the commission. Electric distribution companies should continue to be the provider of last resort in order to ensure the availability of universal electric service in this Commonwealth unless another provider of last resort is approved by the commission. (17) There are certain public purpose costs, including programs for low-income assistance, energy conservation and others, which have been implemented and supported by public utilities' bundled rates. The public purpose is to be promoted by continuing universal service and energy conservation policies, protections and services, and full recovery of such costs is to be permitted through a nonbypassable rate mechanism. (18) There are certain changes to a utility which will create transition costs to accomplish the move to a competitive market. These changes may entail the closure of facilities or reduction in employee levels. If such actions are to be undertaken, the utility must fully inform the commission of the impact of such decisions on local communities and on social services and of any tax implications of the actions. The utility is expected to discuss the transition to competition with its employees or their certified representatives and may provide severance, retraining, early retirement and outplacement services. Such transition costs may be recoverable under the competitive transition charge in section 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge). (19) All participants in the restructured electric industry are encouraged to coordinate their plans and transactions through an independent system operator or its functional equivalent. (20) Since continuing and ensuring the reliability of electric service depends on adequate generation and on conscientious inspection and maintenance of transmission and distribution systems, the independent system operator or its functional equivalent should set, and the commission shall set through regulations, inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement standards and enforce those standards. (21) Under Federal and State clean air laws and regulations, electricity generators located in states to the west and south of this Commonwealth are not subject to requirements as stringent as those which apply to generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the act of January 8, 1960 (1959 P.L.2119, No.787), known as the Air Pollution Control Act, operating in this Commonwealth and that different regions within this Commonwealth are subject to varying air emission requirements. Under some scenarios, competition among electricity generators located in different states and different regions within this Commonwealth could make it more difficult for areas in this Commonwealth to demonstrate attainment with Federal and State air quality standards. Since this result may be caused by the disparate requirements imposed by Federal and State law on generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act in this Commonwealth and generators located in other states, the General Assembly supports changes to Federal clean air laws and regulations that will protect Pennsylvania's environment and ensure that electricity generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act located in this Commonwealth are not placed at an undue competitive disadvantage. The commission will consult with the Department of Environmental Protection regarding this issue during the transition to retail competition. Cross References.

(v) Other transition costs of the utility, including costs of employee severance, retraining, early retirement, outplacement and related expenses, at reasonable levels, for employees who are affected by changes that occur as a result of the restructuring of the electric industry occasioned by this chapter. The term includes any costs attributable to physical plants no longer used and useful because of the transition to retail competition. The term excludes any amounts previously disallowed by the commission as imprudently incurred. To the extent that the recoverability of amounts that are sought to be included as transition or stranded costs are subject to appellate review as of the time of the commission determination, any determination to include such costs shall be reversed to the extent required by the results of that appellate review. \"Transmission and distribution costs.\" All costs directly or indirectly incurred to provide transmission and distribution services to retail electric customers. This includes the return of and return on facilities and other capital investments necessary to provide transmission and distribution services and associated operating expenses, including applicable taxes. \"Universal service and energy conservation.\" Policies, protections and services that help low-income customers to maintain electric service. The term includes customer assistance programs, termination of service protection and policies and services that help low-income customers to reduce or manage energy consumption in a cost-effective manner, such as the low-income usage reduction programs, application of renewable resources and consumer education.

(d) Continuation of existing members of council in office.-- Any member of a municipal governing body in office at the time of the adoption of an optional plan shall remain in office, continuing as an at-large or district council member, as the case may be, until the expiration of this term in office and shall receive the compensation provided by law at that time: (1) If that council member was elected on an at-large basis, the newly adopted optional plan provides for a total number of at-large council members equal to or exceeding the total number of at-large council members under the existing form of government. (2) If that council member was elected on a district basis, the district from which that council member was elected remains unchanged and continues to encompass the exact same geographical area under the newly adopted optional plan as under the existing form of government and the number of council members to be elected from that district under the newly adopted optional plan is equal to or exceeds the number elected from that district under the existing form of government. Any council member may, by writing filed with the municipal treasurer, direct that any portion of his annual compensation for serving in office be returned to the municipal treasury. For the purpose of this section, an executive or mayor who is also a member of the council under an existing plan shall be considered as a member of the council, and, after the new plan goes into effect, his duties shall be only those of a member of council as prescribed by the new plan. (e) Number of members of council to be elected.-- At the municipal election next succeeding the adoption of one of the optional plans provided for in this subpart, the number of council members prescribed by the terms in the plan less the number of council members then in office whose terms do not expire on the first Monday of January next following, as may be determined by subsection (d), shall be elected. (f) Filling vacancies on council existing prior to election.-- If there are vacancies in council occurring by reason of resignation, death or removal 90 days or more before the election, they shall be filled for the remainder of the term of the person originally elected to that office.

The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association. (b) Required agreement.-- An agreement to convey common elements or subject them to a security interest must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date. The agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is situated and is effective only upon recordation. (c) Association powers.-- The association on behalf of the unit owners may contract to convey common elements or subject them to a security interest, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance, including the power to execute deeds or other instruments. (d) Other conveyances or encumbrances void.-- Any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, tax sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of common elements, unless made pursuant to this section, is void. (e) Right of access and support.-- A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this section does not deprive any unit of its right of access and support. (f) Preexisting encumbrances.-- Unless the declaration otherwise provides, a conveyance or encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this section does not affect the priority or validity of preexisting encumbrances. (g) Limitation.-- Common elements which may be conveyed or encumbered pursuant to this section shall not include any land, buildings or other facilities: (1) containing or comprising one or more units; or (2) necessary for the use or operation of one or more units.

(b) If security interest in common elements.-- If the association has granted a security interest in the common elements to a creditor of the association pursuant to section 3318 (relating to conveyance or encumbrance of common elements), the holder of that security interest shall exercise its right against the common elements before its judgment lien on any unit may be enforced. (c) Release upon payment of unit owner's share.-- Whether perfected before or after the creation of the condominium, if a lien other than a deed of trust or mortgage, including a judgment lien or lien attributable to work performed or materials supplied before creation of the condominium, becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the amount of the lien attributable to his unit, and the lienholder, upon receipt of payment, promptly shall deliver a release of the lien covering that unit.

(a) Outside business and residence districts.-- Whenever any police officer finds a vehicle in violation of any of the provisions of section 3351 (relating to stopping, standing and parking outside business and residence districts), the officer may move the vehicle, or cause the vehicle to be moved, or require the driver or other person in charge of the vehicle to move the vehicle, to a position off the roadway where the vehicle will not interfere unduly with the normal movement of traffic or constitute a safety hazard. (b) Unattended vehicle obstructing traffic.-- Any police officer may remove or cause to be removed to a place of safety any unattended vehicle illegally left standing upon any highway, bridge, causeway or in any tunnel, in such position or under such circumstances as to interfere unduly with the normal movement of traffic or constitute a safety hazard. (c) Removal to garage or place of safety.-- Any police officer may remove or cause to be removed to the place of business of the operator of a wrecker or to a nearby garage or other place of safety any vehicle found upon a highway under any of the following circumstances: (1) Report has been made that the vehicle has been stolen or taken without the consent of its owner. (2) The person or persons in charge of the vehicle are physically unable to provide for the custody or removal of the vehicle. (3) The person driving or in control of the vehicle is arrested for an alleged offense for which the officer is required by law to take the person arrested before an issuing authority without unnecessary delay. (4) The vehicle is in violation of section 3353 (relating to prohibitions in specified places) except for overtime parking. (5) The vehicle has been abandoned as defined in this title. The officer shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 73 (relating to abandoned vehicles and cargos). (d) Notice to owner prior to removal.-- (1) Prior to removal of an abandoned vehicle bearing a registration plate, current certificate of inspection or vehicle identification number plate by which the last registered owner of the vehicle can be determined, the police department shall send a notice by certified mail to the last registered owner of the vehicle informing the owner that unless the vehicle is moved to a suitable location within seven days of the date notice is mailed, the vehicle will be removed under this section and held at a suitable facility where it may be reclaimed by the owner in accordance with the provisions of section 7306 (relating to payment of costs upon reclaiming vehicle). If the abandoned motor vehicle does not bear an identifiable registration plate, current certificate of inspection or vehicle identification number plate, the notice may be secured to the vehicle. (2) If, within the seven-day period, the owner so requests, the owner shall be given an opportunity to explain to the police officer or department why the owner believes the vehicle should not be removed. If the police officer or department determines that the vehicle shall, nonetheless, be removed, the owner shall be given an additional 48 hours to remove the vehicle, have it removed or demand a hearing, which shall conform to the requirements of 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 Subch. B (relating to practice and procedure of local agencies). The police officer or department shall inform the owner of the right to a hearing by delivering to the owner a notice warning the owner that, unless the vehicle is removed or a hearing is demanded, the owner shall be subject to the provisions of section 7306. If, as a result of the hearing, it is determined that the vehicle will be removed, the owner shall be given an additional 48 hours to remove the vehicle or have it removed. The hearing shall be before a civilian officer or employee of the municipality in which the vehicle is located. (3) The provision for notice set forth in this subsection is applicable only if the vehicle is abandoned upon a highway and is not in violation of subsection (b) or section 3351(a) or 3353. Notice under this subsection is in addition to any other notice requirements provided in Chapter 73. (4) This subsection does not apply to nonrepairable vehicles.

(ix) Within 30 feet upon the approach to a sign warning of the possible presence of a person with a disability in the vicinity of a roadway adjacent to the person's residence or the possible presence of a person with a disability frequently traversing the roadway at that location. This subparagraph shall not apply unless an enabling local ordinance has been passed. The ordinance may apply generally throughout the municipality or be site specific. The ordinance may specify the height of vehicles prohibited from parking in these locations. The enforcement of this subparagraph requires that a sign indicating the violation and amount of fine be posted at each applicable location. For purposes of this section, the term \"disability\" shall mean a hearing impairment or total or partial blindness. (3) Park a vehicle: (i) Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing. (ii) At any place where official signs prohibit parking. (b) Unattended vehicle on private property.-- (1) No person shall park or leave unattended a vehicle on private property without the consent of the owner or other person in control or possession of the property except in the case of emergency or disablement of the vehicle, in which case the operator shall arrange for the removal of the vehicle as soon as possible. (2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to private parking lots unless such lots are posted to notify the public of any parking restrictions and the operator of the vehicle violates such posted restrictions. For the purposes of this section \"private parking lot\" means a parking lot open to the public or used for parking without charge; or a parking lot used for parking with charge. The department shall define by regulation what constitutes adequate posting for public notice. (c) Property owner may remove vehicle.-- The owner or other person in charge or possession of any property on which a vehicle is parked or left unattended in violation of the provisions of subsection (b) may remove or have removed the vehicle at the reasonable expense of the owner of the vehicle.

Any city, borough, incorporated town or township may, by ordinance, provide for rates to be charged for removal of vehicles and for municipal regulation of authorized towing services. If storage charges are not set by the municipality, a maximum of $25 per day may be charged for storage. (d) Restrictions by appropriate authorities.-- The department on State-designated highways and local authorities on any highway within their boundaries may by erection of official traffic-control devices prohibit, limit or restrict stopping, standing or parking of vehicles on any highway where engineering and traffic studies indicate that stopping, standing or parking would constitute a safety hazard or where the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles would unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic. (e) Penalty.-- Any person violating any provision of this section is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $50.

(a) Two-way highways.-- Except as otherwise provided in this section, every vehicle standing or parked upon a two-way highway shall be positioned parallel to and with the right-hand wheels within 12 inches of the right-hand curb or, in the absence of a curb, as close as practicable to the right edge of the right-hand shoulder. (b) One-way highways.-- Except as otherwise provided in this section, every vehicle standing or parked upon a one-way highway shall be positioned parallel to the curb or edge of the highway in the direction of authorized traffic movement with its right-hand wheels within 12 inches of the right-hand curb or, in the absence of a curb, as close as practicable to the right edge of the right-hand shoulder, or with its left-hand wheels within 12 inches of the left-hand curb or, in the absence of a curb, as close as practicable to the left edge of the left-hand shoulder. (c) Angle parking.-- Local authorities may permit angle parking on any highway after an engineering and traffic study has determined that the highway is of sufficient width to permit angle parking without interfering with the free movement of traffic, except that on a State-designated highway prior approval of the department shall also be obtained. (d) Person with a disability and disabled veterans.-- (1) When a motor vehicle bearing a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran plate or displaying a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran parking placard as prescribed in this title is being operated by or for the transportation of the person with a disability or severely disabled veteran, the driver shall be relieved of any liability for parking for a period of 60 minutes in excess of the legal parking period permitted by local authorities except where local ordinances or police regulations provide for the accommodation of heavy traffic during morning, afternoon or evening hours. (2) At the request of a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran, local authorities may erect on the highway as close as possible to the person's or veteran's place of residence a sign or signs indicating that that place is reserved for a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran, that no parking is allowed there by others, and that any unauthorized person parking there shall be subject to a fine and may be towed. The absence of a sign stating the penalty amount indicated in subsection (f) at parking spaces designated with an international symbol for access for persons with disabilities on a sign shall not preclude the enforcement of this subsection. A vehicle may only be towed under this paragraph if the parking space is posted with a sign indicating that vehicles in violation of this section may be towed.

Under this paragraph, local authorities may charge a reasonable fee and shall comply with section 6109 (relating to specific powers of department and local authorities) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327). (3) (i) Except for persons parking vehicles lawfully bearing a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran registration plate or displaying a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran parking placard when such vehicles are being operated by or for the transportation of a person with a disability or a severely disabled veteran, no person shall park a vehicle on public or private property reserved for a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran which property has been so posted in accordance with departmental regulations. Regulations shall require that parking spaces designated with an international symbol for access for persons with disabilities on a sign are posted with a sign stating the penalty amount indicated in subsection (f) and that vehicles in violation of the subsection may be towed and require that signs be replaced when they become either obsolete or missing with all costs to replace the necessary signs to be borne by the persons responsible for signing the particular location. The absence of a sign stating the penalty amount at parking spaces designated with an international symbol for access for persons with disabilities shall not preclude the enforcement of this subsection. A vehicle which is unlawfully parked in a designated person with a disability parking area may be removed from that area by towing and may be reclaimed by the vehicle owner upon payment of the towing costs. A vehicle may only be towed under this paragraph if the parking space is posted with a sign indicating that vehicles in violation of this section may be towed. (ii) Local authorities shall have the power and may, by ordinance or resolution, authorize a person with a disability and severely disabled veterans to issue statements to violators or violating vehicles for violation of subparagraph (i). The form of the statement shall be as prescribed by the local authorities. (iii) No occupancy or driveway permit may be issued to a person whose property is reserved for a person with a disability or a severely disabled veteran if the property is not posted with a sign stating the penalty amount indicated in subsection (f). (d.1) Obstructing movement.-- A person may not obstruct a space on public or private property reserved for a person with a disability or a part of a curb ramp or the access aisle adjacent to a parking space reserved for a person with a disability in a manner that would prevent a person or wheelchair or personal mobility device from entering or leaving a vehicle legally parked in an adjoining space. (e) Unauthorized use.-- An operator of a vehicle bearing a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran plate or displaying a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran parking placard shall not make use of the parking privileges accorded to a person with a disability and severely disabled veterans under subsection (d)(3) unless the operator is a person with a disability or a severely disabled veteran or unless the vehicle is being operated for the transportation of a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran. (e.1) Motorcycle parking.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6301 (relating to prosecutions under local ordinances superseded by title) regarding parking violations, a local ordinance may not prohibit nor cite as a violation the parallel or angle occupancy by one or more motorcycles in any parking space on any highway otherwise available for parking for other individual vehicles, provided that the space occupied by one or more motorcycles does not exceed the space within which a single vehicle must park. In the instance of a violation applicable to any single vehicle, each motorcycle so parked shall be individually liable for any violation as if the motorcycle were the sole occupant of the parking space. (f) Penalty.-- A person violating subsection (a), (b) or (d)(1) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $15. A person violating subsection (d)(2) or (3) or (e) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $200.

(b) Existing cooperatives.-- Except as provided in subsection (c), sections 4106, 4107, 4203 (relating to construction and validity of declaration and bylaws), 4219 (relating to master associations), 4220 (relating to merger or consolidation of cooperatives), 4302(a)(1) through (6) and (11) through (17) (relating to powers of association), 4311 (relating to tort and contract liability), 4315 (relating to lien for assessments), 4317 (relating to association records), 4319 (relating to termination of cooperative interest), 4409 (relating to resales of cooperative interests) and 4415 (relating to effect of violations on rights of action), and section 4103 (relating to definitions) to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subpart and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. By compliance with the requirements of section 4201 (relating to creation of cooperative ownership), a cooperative created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart may be made subject to all of the provisions of this subpart, effective as of the date of recordation of the document or documents specified in section 4201, without in any way terminating the cooperative status of the property or in any way affecting any lien or encumbrance on the property, if the terms of such document or documents have been approved by all the persons whose actions would have been required to effect the termination of the cooperative pursuant to its governing documents in effect at the time such approval is given, provided, however, that such action shall not increase the obligations or responsibilities of a declarant, as such and not as a proprietary lessee, without the joinder of the declarant in the document or documents required by section 4201.

(d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart. (2) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made pursuant to this subpart. An amendment to the declaration or bylaws authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the declaration and bylaws being amended.

(e) Nonresidential units.-- This subpart does not apply to a planned community in which all units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use unless the declaration provides that the subpart does apply to that planned community. This subpart applies to a planned community containing both units which are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use and other units which are not so restricted only if the declaration so provides or if the real estate comprising the units which may be used for residential purposes would be a planned community in the absence of the units which may not be used for residential purposes.

The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service credit in that county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous county employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer, by the member, county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's county or municipal pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the county or municipal pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by December 31, 1987, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by December 31, 1987.

Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service in accordance with county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system benefit provisions, multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members. The Public Employee Retirement Study Commission shall determine the appropriate amount of employer contributions to be transferred to the system by the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems. (2) If the member died prior to the effective date of this subsection, the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1). In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by December 31, 1987. If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before January 1, 1988, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by March 31, 1988. If the member dies after December 31, 1987, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), neither the member or his estate shall receive credit for the prior service.

(2) The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service in the \"predecessor corporation\" transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, the provisions of section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer by the member or the \"predecessor corporation\" to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the member's pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by June 30, 1992, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the \"predecessor corporation\" pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by June 30, 1992. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall pay as pick-up contributions the difference between the amount credited to the member's account and the amount otherwise due under section 5504. Such additional contributions paid by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall not be considered compensation for the purposes of this part. If the amount transferred to the system by the member is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members so long as the amount to be transferred is equal to or less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee. In the event that the amount required to be transferred is greater than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee shall be transferred to the system, and the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system the additional funds needed to satisfy the requirements of the calculation in this paragraph. If the amount required to be transferred is less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority may retain the amount not needed for transfer. (3) If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before July 1, 1992, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or may request that the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by September 30, 1992. If the member dies after June 30, 1992, without making the transfer or without requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), neither the member nor his estate shall receive credit for the prior service.

(3) Contributions to be paid by an active member for credit for New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be sufficient to provide an amount equal to the regular and additional accumulated deductions which would have been standing to the credit of the member for such service had regular and additional member contributions been made to the board with full coverage as a Class A member during the period of New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and had these regular and additional accumulated deductions been credited with statutory interest up to the date of purchase. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account.

(9) In the event the member is or was an annuitant, any annuity paid or payable during the period of such service with the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network shall be canceled retroactive to the date the member began service with the New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network, any such annuity payments made to the member shall be repaid by the member, and the provisions of section 5706 (relating to termination of annuities) shall apply if applicable.

      "text": "§ 5312. Insurance. (a) Insurance to be carried by association.-- Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available, all of the following: (1) Property insurance on the common facilities and controlled facilities to the extent the controlled facilities can be insured separately from the unit and, if insurance for the unit is not provided by the association under subsection (b) or the declaration, insuring against all common risks of direct physical loss. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies. (2) Comprehensive general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage, arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements. (3) Any property or comprehensive general liability insurance carried by the association may contain a deductible provision. (b) Units having horizontal boundaries.-- In the case of a building containing units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, that insurance described in subsection (a)(1), to the extent reasonably available, shall include the units but need not include improvements and betterments installed by unit owners. (c) Other insurance carried by association.-- If the insurance described in subsections (a) and (b) is not maintained, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to all unit owners. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance. The association may carry any other insurance in such reasonable amounts and with such reasonable deductibles as the executive board may deem appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners. (d) Policy terms.-- Insurance policies carried under subsections (a) and (b) shall provide all of the following: (1) Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his membership in the association. (2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or member of the owner's household. (3) No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy. (4) If at the time of a loss under the policy there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy is primary insurance not contributing with the other insurance. (e) Proceeds from property insurance.-- Any loss covered by the property policy under subsections (a)(1) and (b) shall be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss shall be payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (h), the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged common elements and units, and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the common elements and units have been completely repaired or restored or the planned community is terminated. (f) Unit owner insurance.-- A unit owner may insure his unit for all losses to his unit, including losses not covered by the insurance maintained by the association due to a deductible provision or otherwise. A residential unit owner shall insure the owner's unit except as insurance is provided by the association in accordance with this section or the declaration. An insurance policy issued to the association shall not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the owner's own benefit, including, but not limited to, insurance to cover any deductibles or losses not covered by the association's property or comprehensive general liability insurance. (g) Evidence and cancellation of insurance.-- An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon request, to any unit owner, mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance may not be canceled until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued. (h) Disposition of insurance proceeds.-- (1) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the association by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless: (i) the planned community is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. Except for the costs of repair or replacement which are not covered due to deductibles, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves, which have not been identified by the executive board to fund costs of capital expenditures budgeted for the current fiscal year of the association, is a common expense. (2) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the unit owner by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the unit owner unless: (i) the planned community is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote to not rebuild. The cost of repair or replacement of these portions in excess of insurance proceeds is the unit owner's expense. (3) If the entire planned community is not repaired or replaced, the following apply: (i) The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the planned community. (ii) The insurance proceeds attributable to units shall be paid to unit owners except those proceeds attributable to controlled facilities for which insurance is separately maintained by the association under this section or the declaration shall be distributed to all unit owners in proportion to their common expense liability. Proceeds attributable to limited common facilities which are not rebuilt shall be distributed equally to owners of units to which those limited common facilities were assigned. (iii) The remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners in proportion to their common expense liability. (4) If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's votes in the association and common expense liability are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under section 5107(a) (relating to eminent domain), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, section 5220 (relating to termination of planned community) governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the planned community is terminated. (i) Nonresidential planned communities.-- The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a planned community all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use. (j) Recovery of deductibles.-- If any insurance policy maintained by the association contains a deductible, then that portion of any loss or claim which is not covered by insurance due to the application of a deductible, as well as any claim or loss for which the association is self-insured, shall be levied by the executive board in accordance with section 5314(c) (relating to assessments for common expenses).

The budgets of the association shall segregate limited common expenses from general common expenses if and to the extent appropriate.

Any past due assessment or installment thereof shall bear interest at the rate established by the association at not more than 15% per year. (c) Special allocations of expenses.-- Except as provided by the declaration: (1) Any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair or replacement of a limited common element shall be assessed in equal shares against the units to which that limited common element was assigned at the time the expense was incurred. (2) Any common expense benefiting fewer than all of the units shall be assessed exclusively against the units benefited.

(c) Stay.-- If a court of this Commonwealth determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper. (d) Jurisdiction declined.-- A court of this Commonwealth may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if a child custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.

(a) General rule.-- Except as otherwise provided in section 5424 (relating to temporary emergency jurisdiction) or by other laws of this Commonwealth, if a court of this Commonwealth has jurisdiction under this chapter because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless: (1) the parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction; (2) a court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under sections 5421 (relating to initial child custody jurisdiction) through 5423 (relating to jurisdiction to modify determination) determines that this Commonwealth is a more appropriate forum under section 5427 (relating to inconvenient forum); or (3) no court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in sections 5421 through 5423. (b) Jurisdiction declined; remedy.-- If a court of this Commonwealth declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a), it may fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure the safety of the child and prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a child custody proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction under sections 5421 through 5423. (c) Jurisdiction declined; expenses.-- If a court dismisses a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a), it shall assess against the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction necessary and reasonable expenses, including costs, communication expenses, attorney fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses and child care during the course of the proceedings unless the party from whom fees are sought establishes that the assessment would be clearly inappropriate.

      "text": "§ 5461. Decisions by health care representative. (a) General rule.-- A health care representative may make a health care decision for an individual whose attending physician has determined that the individual is incompetent if: (1) the individual is at least 18 years of age, has graduated from high school, has married or is an emancipated minor; (2) (i) the individual does not have a health care power of attorney; or (ii) the individual's health care agent is not reasonably available or has indicated an unwillingness to act and no alternate health care agent is reasonably available; and (3) a guardian of the person to make health care decisions has not been appointed for the individual. (b) Application.-- This section applies to decisions regarding treatment, care, goods or services that a caretaker is obligated to provide to a care-dependent person who has an end-stage medical condition or is permanently unconscious as permitted under 18 Pa.C.S. § 2713(e)(5) (relating to neglect of care-dependent person). (c) Extent of authority of health care representative.-- Except as set forth in section 5462(c)(1) (relating to duties of attending physician and health care provider), the authority and the decision-making process of a health care representative shall be the same as provided for a health care agent in section 5456 (relating to authority of health care agent) and 5460(c) (relating to relation of health care agent to court-appointed guardian and other agents). (d) Who may act as health care representative.-- (1) An individual of sound mind may, by a signed writing or by personally informing the attending physician or the health care provider, designate one or more individuals to act as health care representative. In the absence of a designation or if no designee is reasonably available, any member of the following classes, in descending order of priority, who is reasonably available may act as health care representative: (i) The spouse, unless an action for divorce is pending, and the adult children of the principal who are not the children of the spouse. (ii) An adult child. (iii) A parent. (iv) An adult brother or sister. (v) An adult grandchild. (vi) An adult who has knowledge of the principal's preferences and values, including, but not limited to, religious and moral beliefs, to assess how the principal would make health care decisions. (2) An individual may by signed writing, including a health care power of attorney, provide for a different order of priority. (3) An individual with a higher priority who is willing to act as a health care representative may assume the authority to act notwithstanding the fact that another individual has previously assumed that authority. (e) Disqualification.-- An individual of sound mind may disqualify one or more individuals from acting as health care representative in the same manner as specified under subsection (d) for the designation of a health care representative. An individual may also disqualify one or more individuals from acting as health care representative by a health care power of attorney. Upon the petition of any member of the classes set forth in subsection (d), the court may disqualify for cause shown an individual otherwise eligible to serve as a health care representative. (f) Limitation on designation of health care representative.-- Unless related by blood, marriage or adoption, a health care representative may not be the principal's attending physician or other health care provider nor an owner, operator or employee of a health care provider in which the principal receives care. (g) Decision of health care representative.-- (1) If more than one member of a class assumes authority to act as a health care representative, the members do not agree on a health care decision and the attending physician or health care provider is so informed, the attending physician or health care provider may rely on the decision of a majority of the members of that class who have communicated their views to the attending physician or health care provider. (2) If the members of the class of health care representatives are evenly divided concerning the health care decision and the attending physician or health care provider is so informed, an individual having a lower priority may not act as a health care representative. So long as the class remains evenly divided, no decision shall be deemed made until such time as the parties resolve their disagreement. Notwithstanding such disagreement, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude the administration of health care treatment in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice. (h) Duty of health care representative.-- Promptly upon assuming authority to act, a health care representative shall communicate the assumption of authority to the members of the principal's family specified in subsection (d) who can be readily contacted. (i) Countermand of health care decision.-- (1) A principal of sound mind may countermand any health care decision made by the principal's health care representative at any time and in any manner by personally informing the attending physician or health care provider. (2) Regardless of the principal's mental or physical capacity, a principal may countermand a health care decision made by the principal's health care representative that would withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment at any time and in any manner by personally informing the attending physician. (3) The attending physician or health care provider shall make reasonable efforts to promptly inform the health care representative of a countermand exercised under this section. (4) A countermand exercised under this section shall not affect the authority of the health care representative to make other health care decisions. (j) Court approval unnecessary.-- A health care decision made by a health care representative for a principal shall be effective without court approval. (k) Written declaration of health care representative.-- An attending physician or health care provider may require a person claiming the right to act as health care representative for a principal to provide a written declaration made under penalty of perjury stating facts and circumstances reasonably sufficient to establish the claimed authority.

(2) If the department determines that there is no positive percentage change, then no adjustment to the base amounts shall occur for the relevant time period provided for in this subsection. (3) (i) If the department determines that there is a positive percentage change in the first year that the determination is made under paragraph (1), the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by each base amount, and the products shall be added to the base amounts, respectively, and the sums shall be preliminary adjusted amounts. (ii) The preliminary adjusted amounts shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a), (b) and (c). (4) In each successive year in which there is a positive percentage change in the CPI-U for the United States City Average, the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by the most recent preliminary adjusted amounts, and the products shall be added to the preliminary adjusted amount of the prior year to calculate the preliminary adjusted amounts for the current year. The sums thereof shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the new final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a), (b) and (c). (5) The determinations and adjustments required under this subsection shall be made in the period between October 1 and November 15 of the year following the effective date of this subsection and annually between October 1 and November 15 of each year thereafter.

(8) The annual increase in the preliminary adjusted base amounts obtained under paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not exceed 3%. (d) Notice.-- The term \"advertisement\" or \"public notice,\" wherever used in this section, shall mean a notice published at least ten days before the award of a contract in a newspaper of general circulation published in the municipality where the authority has its principal office or, if no newspaper of general circulation is published therein, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the authority has its principal office. (e) Conflict of interest.-- No member of the authority or officer or employee of the authority may directly or indirectly be a party to or be interested in any contract or agreement with the authority for any matter, cause or thing if the contract or agreement establishes liability against or indebtedness of the authority. Any contract or agreement made in violation of this subsection is void, and no action may be maintained on the agreement against the authority. (f) Entry into contracts.-- (1) Subject to subsection (e), an authority may enter into and carry out contracts or establish or comply with rules and regulations concerning labor and materials and other related matters in connection with a project or portion thereof as the authority deems desirable or as may be requested by a Federal agency to assist in the financing of the project or any part thereof.

(2) This subsection is intended to make unlawful the practice of evading advertising requirements by making a series of purchases or contracts each for less than the advertising requirement price or by making several simultaneous purchases or contracts each below that price when in either case the transaction involved should have been made as one transaction for one price. (3) An authority member who votes to unlawfully evade the provisions of this section and who knows that the transaction upon which the member votes is or ought to be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids commits a misdemeanor of the third degree for each contract entered into as a direct result of that vote. (i) Procurement.-- Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or of Title 62 (relating to procurement) to the contrary, an authority shall be considered a State-affiliated entity for purposes of compliance with Title 62.

(a) Determination of incapacity.-- In all cases, the court shall consider and make specific findings of fact concerning: (1) The nature of any condition or disability which impairs the individual's capacity to make and communicate decisions. (2) The extent of the individual's capacity to make and communicate decisions. (3) The need for guardianship services, if any, in light of such factors as the availability of family, friends and other supports to assist the individual in making decisions and in light of the existence, if any, of less restrictive alternatives. The court shall make specific findings of fact based on the evidentiary record of the absence of sufficient family, friends or other supports and of the insufficiency of each less restrictive alternative before ordering guardianship. Less restrictive alternatives include, but are not limited to: (i) Advance directives such as durable power of attorney or trusts. (ii) Living wills. (iii) Health care powers of attorney. (iv) Health care representatives. (v) Financial powers of attorney. (vi) Trusts, including special needs trusts. (vii) Representative payees for individuals receiving Social Security benefits.

(4) The type of guardian, limited or plenary, of the person or estate needed based on the nature of any condition or disability and the capacity to make and communicate decisions. (5) The duration of the guardianship. (6) The court shall prefer less restrictive alternatives to guardianship and, if no less restrictive alternatives are available and sufficient, limited guardianship. The following apply: (i) A determination of incapacity is separate from a determination of whether a guardian should be appointed. (ii) The court may not use a determination of incapacity alone to justify a guardianship. (iii) The court may not appoint a guardian if a lesser restrictive alternative exists that is sufficient to support the needs of an incapacitated person. (iv) When entering an order denying a petition for guardianship in whole or in part, the court shall identify the less restrictive alternatives that are available and sufficient to enable the alleged incapacitated person to manage personal financial resources or to meet essential requirements of personal physical health and safety. An order may assist the respondent and any supportive and substitute decision makers involved to effectuate the respondent's decisions with third parties. (b) Limited guardian of the person.-- Upon a finding that the person is partially incapacitated and in need of guardianship services, the court shall enter an order appointing a limited guardian of the person with powers consistent with the court's findings of limitations, which may include: (1) General care, maintenance and custody of the incapacitated person. (2) Designating the place for the incapacitated person to live. (3) Assuring that the incapacitated person receives such training, education, medical and psychological services and social and vocational opportunities, as appropriate, as well as assisting the incapacitated person in the development of maximum self-reliance and independence. (4) Providing required consents or approvals on behalf of the incapacitated person. (c) Plenary guardian of the person.-- The court may appoint a plenary guardian of the person only upon a finding that the person is totally incapacitated and in need of plenary guardianship services. (d) Limited guardian of the estate.-- Upon a finding that the person is partially incapacitated and in need of guardianship services, the court shall enter an order appointing a limited guardian of the estate with powers consistent with the court's finding of limitations, which shall specify the portion of assets or income over which the guardian of the estate is assigned powers and duties. (e) Plenary guardian of the estate.-- A court may appoint a plenary guardian of the estate only upon a finding that the person is totally incapacitated and in need of plenary guardianship services. (f) No presumption.-- No presumption of incapacity shall be raised from the alleged incapacitated person's institutionalization. (g) Legal rights retained.-- Except in those areas designated by court order as areas over which the limited guardian has power, a partially incapacitated person shall retain all legal rights. (h) Information as to rights.-- At the conclusion of a proceeding in which the person has been adjudicated incapacitated, the court shall assure that the person is informed of his right to appeal and to petition to modify or terminate the guardianship.

(a) Automatic review.-- If the evidence presented during the guardianship proceeding indicates that the circumstances of the person's incapacity may change, the court shall hold a review hearing to determine whether the guardianship continues to be necessary. The court shall set the date for a review hearing under this subsection in the court's order establishing guardianship. The review hearing under this subsection shall be held no later than one year from the date of the order establishing the guardianship. The hearing shall be conducted in the presence of the incapacitated person and the person's attorney, and the court shall adhere to the procedures and standards as outlined in section 5512.1(a) (relating to determination of incapacity and appointment of guardian). If, following the presentation of evidence and testimony from all parties, the court finds that guardianship continues to be necessary and that no less restrictive alternatives exist, the court may order that the guardianship continue. If the court finds that guardianship is no longer necessary or a less restrictive alternative exists, the court shall discharge the guardianship. In determining whether the circumstances of the person's incapacity may change, the court may consider any of the following: (1) whether the incapacity could be adequately managed by medication, rehabilitation or other means; (2) whether the potential exists for the incapacitated person to regain physical or cognitive capacity; (3) the opinion of a medical professional or other qualified expert who has personally examined the incapacitated person; (4) the circumstances of the incapacitated person's daily living, including, but not limited to, support from others; and (5) any other factor indicating that the incapacitated person's condition could improve at a future time.

(18) Storm water planning, management and implementation as defined in the articles of incorporation by the governing body. Authorities, existing as of the effective date of this paragraph, already operating storm water controls as part of a combined sewer system, sanitary sewer system or flood control project may continue to operate those projects. (b) Limitations.-- This section is subject to the following limitations: (1) An authority created by a school district or school districts shall have the power only to acquire, hold, construct, improve, maintain, operate and lease public school buildings and other school projects acquired, constructed or improved for public school purposes. (2) The purpose and intent of this chapter being to benefit the people of the Commonwealth by, among other things, increasing their commerce, health, safety and prosperity and not to unnecessarily burden or interfere with existing business by the establishment of competitive enterprises, none of the powers granted by this chapter shall be exercised in the construction, financing, improvement, maintenance, extension or operation of any project or projects or providing financing for insurance reserves which in whole or in part shall duplicate or compete with existing enterprises serving substantially the same purposes. This limitation shall not apply to the exercise of the powers granted under this section: (i) for facilities and equipment for the collection, removal or disposal of ashes, garbage, rubbish and other refuse materials by incineration, landfill or other methods if each municipality organizing or intending to use the facilities of an authority having such powers shall declare by resolution or ordinance that it is desirable for the health and safety of the people of such municipality that it use the facilities of the authority and state if any contract between such municipality and any other person, firm or corporation for the collection, removal or disposal of ashes, garbage, rubbish and other refuse material has by its terms expired or is terminable at the option of the municipality or will expire within six months from the date such ordinance becomes effective; (ii) for industrial development projects if the authority does not develop industrial projects which will compete with existing industries; (iii) for authorities created for the purpose of providing business improvements and administrative services if each municipality organizing an authority for such a project shall declare by resolution or ordinance that it is desirable for the entire local government unit to improve the business district; (iv) to hospital projects or health centers to be leased to or financed with loans to public hospitals, nonprofit corporation health centers or nonprofit hospital corporations serving the public or to school building projects and facilities to be leased to or financed with loans to private, nonprofit, nonsectarian secondary schools, colleges and universities, State-related universities and community colleges or to facilities, as limited under the provisions of this section, to produce steam or to generate electric power if each municipality organizing an authority for such a project shall declare by resolution or ordinance that it is desirable for the health, safety and welfare of the people in the area served by such facilities to have such facilities provided by or financed through an authority; (v) to provide financing for insurance reserves if each municipality or authority intending to use any proceeds thereof shall declare by resolution or ordinance that it is desirable for the health, safety and welfare of the people in such local government unit or served by such authority; or (vi) to projects for financing working capital. (3) It is the intent of this chapter in specifying and defining the authorized purposes and projects of an authority to permit the authority to benefit the people of this Commonwealth by, among other things, increasing their commerce, health, safety and prosperity while not unnecessarily burdening or interfering with any municipality which has not incorporated or joined that authority. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an authority shall not have as its purpose and shall not undertake as a project solely for revenue-producing purposes the acquiring of buildings, facilities or tracts of land which in the case of an authority incorporated or joined by a county or counties are located either within or outside the boundaries of the county or counties and in the case of all other authorities are located outside the boundaries of the municipality or municipalities that incorporated or joined the authority unless either: (i) the governing body of each municipality in which the project will be undertaken has by resolution evidenced its approval; or (ii) in cases where the property acquired is not subject to tax abatement, the authority covenants and agrees with each municipality in which the authority will acquire real property as part of the project either to make annual payments in lieu of real estate taxes and special assessments for amounts and time periods specified in the agreement or to pay annually the amount of real estate taxes and special assessments which would be payable if the real property so acquired were fully taxable and subject to special assessments. (c) Effect of specificity.-- The municipality or municipalities organizing such an authority may, in the resolution or ordinance signifying their intention so to do or from time to time by subsequent resolution or ordinance, specify the project or projects to be undertaken by the authority, and no other projects shall be undertaken by the authority than those so specified. If the municipal authorities organizing an authority fail to specify the project or projects to be undertaken, then the authority shall be deemed to have all the powers granted by this chapter. (d) Powers.-- Every authority may exercise all powers necessary or convenient for the carrying out of the purposes set forth in this section, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following rights and powers: (1) To have existence for a term of 50 years and for such further period or periods as may be provided in articles of amendment approved under section 5605(e) (relating to amendment of articles). (2) To sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, complain and defend in all courts. (3) To adopt, use and alter at will a corporate seal. (4) To acquire, purchase, hold, lease as lessee and use any franchise, property, real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible, or any interest therein necessary or desirable for carrying out the purposes of the authority, and to sell, lease as lessor, transfer and dispose of any property or interest therein at any time acquired by it. (5) To acquire by purchase, lease or otherwise and to construct, improve, maintain, repair and operate projects. (6) To finance projects by making loans which may be evidenced by and secured as may be provided in loan agreements, mortgages, security agreements or any other contracts, instruments or agreements, which contracts, instruments or agreements may contain such provisions as the authority shall deem necessary or desirable for the security or protection of the authority or its bondholders. (7) To make bylaws for the management and regulation of its affairs. (8) To appoint officers, agents, employees and servants, to prescribe their duties and to fix their compensation. (9) To fix, alter, charge and collect rates and other charges in the area served by its facilities at reasonable and uniform rates to be determined exclusively by it for the purpose of providing for the payment of the expenses of the authority, the construction, improvement, repair, maintenance and operation of its facilities and properties and, in the case of an authority created for the purpose of making business improvements or providing administrative services, a charge for such services which is to be based on actual benefits and which may be measured on, among other things, gross sales or gross or net profits, the payment of the principal of and interest on its obligations and to fulfill the terms and provisions of any agreements made with the purchasers or holders of any such obligations, or with a municipality and to determine by itself exclusively the services and improvements required to provide adequate, safe and reasonable service, including extensions thereof, in the areas served. If the service area includes more than one municipality, the revenues from any project shall not be expended directly or indirectly on any other project unless such expenditures are made for the benefit of the entire service area. Any person questioning the reasonableness or uniformity of a rate fixed by an authority or the adequacy, safety and reasonableness of the authority's services, including extensions thereof, may bring suit against the authority in the court of common pleas of the county where the project is located or, if the project is located in more than one county, in the court of common pleas of the county where the principal office of the project is located. The court of common pleas shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine questions involving rates or service. Except in municipal corporations having a population density of 300 persons or more per square mile, all owners of real property in eighth class counties may decline in writing the services of a solid waste authority. The owner of multiple residential units that are served by a single water meter may periodically request the authority to adjust the amount billed by showing a minimum of five consecutive years of actual usage data to determine if the amount billed exceeds the actual usage by 30% or more. If the usage data shows that an adjustment is needed, the authority shall appropriately adjust the billing and use the adjusted amount going forward. When calculating the new amount, the authority may include up to 10% over the amount used. After an initial adjustment, the owner may not request another adjustment for five years after the adjustment is completed. (10) In the case of an authority which has agreed to provide water service through a separate meter and separate service line to a residential dwelling unit in which the owner does not reside, to impose and enforce the owner's duty to pay a tenant's bill for service rendered to the tenant by the authority only if the authority notifies the owner and the tenant within 30 days after the bill first becomes overdue. Notification shall be provided by first class mail to the address of the owner provided to the authority by the owner and to the billing address of the tenant, respectively. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require an authority to terminate service to a tenant, and the owner shall not be liable for any service which the authority provides to the tenant 90 or more days after the tenant's bill first becomes due unless the authority has been prevented by court order from terminating service to that tenant. (11) In the case of an authority which has agreed to provide sewer service to a residential dwelling unit in which the owner does not reside, to impose and enforce the owner's duty to pay a tenant's bill for service rendered by the authority to the tenant. The authority shall notify the owner and the tenant within 30 days after the tenant's bill for that service first becomes overdue. Notification shall be provided by first class mail to the address of the owner provided to the authority by the owner and to the billing address of the tenant, respectively. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to relieve the owner of liability for such service unless the authority fails to provide the notice required in this paragraph. (12) To borrow money, make and issue negotiable notes, bonds, refunding bonds and other evidences of indebtedness or obligations, hereinafter called bonds, of the authority. Bonds shall have a maturity date not longer than 40 years from the date of issue except that no refunding bonds shall have a maturity date later than the life of the authority; also, to secure the payment of the bonds or any part thereof by pledge or deed of trust of all or any of its revenues and receipts; to make agreements with the purchasers or holders of the bonds or with others in connection with any bonds, whether issued or to be issued, as the authority shall deem advisable; and in general to provide for the security for the bonds and the rights of the bondholders. In respect to any project constructed and operated under agreement with any authority or any public authority of any adjoining state, to borrow money and issue notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness and obligations jointly with that authority. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no authority shall borrow money on obligations to be paid primarily out of lease rentals or other current revenues other than charges made to the public for the use of the capital projects financed if the net debt of the lessee municipality or municipalities shall exceed any limit provided by any law of the Commonwealth. (13) To make contracts of every name and nature and to execute all instruments necessary or convenient for the carrying on of its business. (14) Without limitation of the foregoing, to borrow money and accept grants from and to enter into contracts, leases or other transactions with any Federal agency, the Commonwealth or a municipality, school district, corporation or authority. (15) To have the power of eminent domain. (16) To pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber all or any of the revenues or receipts of the authority as security for all or any of the obligations of the authority. (17) To do all acts and things necessary or convenient for the promotion of its business and the general welfare of the authority to carry out the powers granted to it by this chapter or other law, including, but not limited to, the adoption of reasonable rules and regulations that apply to water and sewer lines located on a property owned or leased by a customer and to refer for prosecution as a summary offense any violation dealing with rules and regulations relating to water and sewer lines located on a property owned or leased by a customer. Under this paragraph, an authority established by a county of the second class A which is not a home rule county shall have powers for the inspection and repair of sewer facilities comparable to the powers of health officials under section 3007 of the act of May 1, 1933 (P.L.103, No.69), known as The Second Class Township Code. (18) To contract with any municipality, corporation or a public authority of this and an adjoining state on terms as the authority shall deem proper for the construction and operation of any project which is partly in this Commonwealth and partly in the adjoining state. (19) To enter into contracts to supply water and other services to and for municipalities that are not members of the authority or to and for the Commonwealth, municipalities, school districts, persons or authorities and fix the amount to be paid therefor. (20) (i) To make contracts of insurance with an insurance company, association or exchange authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth, insuring its employees and appointed officers and officials under a policy or policies of insurance covering life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability income. Statutory requirements for such insurance, including, but not limited to, requisite number of eligible employees, appointed officers and officials, as provided for in section 621.2 of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.682, No.284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921, and sections 1, 2, 6, 7 and 9 of the act of May 11, 1949 (P.L.1210, No.367), known as the Group Life Insurance Policy Law, shall be met. (ii) To make contracts with an insurance company, association or exchange or any hospital plan corporation or professional health service corporation authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth insuring or covering its employees and their dependents but not its appointed officers and officials nor their dependents for hospital and medical benefits and to contract for its employees but not its appointed officers and officials with an insurance company, association or exchange authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth granting annuities or to establish, maintain, operate and administer its own pension plan covering its employees but not its appointed officers and officials. (iii) For the purposes set forth under this paragraph, to agree to pay part or all of the cost of this insurance, including the premiums or charges for carrying these contracts, and to appropriate out of its treasury any money necessary to pay such costs, premiums or charges. The proper officers of the authority who are authorized to enter into such contracts are authorized, enabled and permitted to deduct from the officers' or employees' pay, salary or compensation that part of the premium or cost which is payable by the officer or employee and as may be so authorized by the officer or employee in writing. (21) To charge the cost of construction of any sewer or water main constructed by the authority against the properties benefited, improved or accommodated thereby to the extent of such benefits. These benefits shall be assessed in the manner provided under this chapter for the exercise of the right of eminent domain. (22) To charge the cost of construction of a sewer or water main constructed by the authority against the properties benefited, improved or accommodated by the construction according to the foot front rule. Charges shall be based upon the foot frontage of the properties benefited and shall be a lien against such properties. Charges may be assessed and collected and liens may be enforced in the manner provided by law for the assessment and collection of charges and the enforcement of liens of the municipality in which such authority is located. No charge shall be assessed unless prior to the construction of a sewer or water main the authority submitted the plan of construction and estimated cost to the municipality in which the project is to be undertaken and the municipality approved it. The properties benefited, improved or accommodated by the construction may not be charged an aggregate amount in excess of the approved estimated cost. (23) To require the posting of financial security to insure the completion in accordance with the approved plat and with the rules and regulations of the authority of any water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, and related apparatus and facilities required to be installed by or on behalf of a developer under an approved land development or subdivision plat as these terms are defined under the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.805, No.247), known as the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. If financial security is required by the authority and without limitation as to other types of financial security which the authority may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, federally chartered or Commonwealth-chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in these lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security. Financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or federally chartered or Commonwealth-chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the financial security if the bonding company or lending institution is authorized to conduct business within this Commonwealth. The bond or other security shall provide for and secure to the authority the completion of required improvements within one year from the date of posting of the security. The amount of financial security shall be equal to 110% of the cost of the required improvements for which financial security is to be posted. The cost of required improvements shall be established by submitting to the authority a bona fide bid from a contractor chosen by the party posting the financial security. In the absence of a bona fide bid, the cost shall be established by an estimate prepared by the authority's engineer. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year from the date of posting the financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary date from the initial posting date or to 110% of the cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security may request the authority to release or authorize the release of, from time to time, portions of the financial security necessary to pay the contractor performing the work. Release requests shall be in writing addressed to the authority, and the authority shall have 45 days after receiving a request to ascertain from the authority engineer, certified in writing, that the portion of the work has been completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon receiving written certification, the authority shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount estimated by the authority engineer to fairly represent the value of the improvements completed. If the authority fails to act within the 45-day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the requested release of funds. The authority may, prior to final release at the time of completion and certification by its engineer, retain 10% of the original amount of the posted financial security for the improvements. If the authority accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements following completion, it may require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of the dedicated improvements as well as the functioning of the improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final plat and the authority's rules and regulations. This financial security shall expire not later than 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication and shall be of the same type as set forth in this paragraph with regard to that which is required for installation of the improvements, except that it shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of the improvements. Any inconsistent ordinance, resolution or statute is null and void. (24) To charge enumerated fees to property owners who desire to or are required to connect to the authority's sewer or water system. Fees shall be based upon the duly adopted fee schedule which is in effect at the time of payment and shall be payable at the time of application for connection or at a time to which the property owner and the authority agree. In the case of projects to serve existing development, fees shall be payable at a time to be determined by the authority. An authority may require that no capacity be guaranteed for a property owner until the tapping fees have been paid or secured by other financial security. The fees shall be in addition to any charges assessed against the property in the construction of a sewer or water main by the authority under paragraphs (21) and (22) as well as any other user charges imposed by the authority under paragraph (9), except that no reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge shall be imposed or collected from a property owner who has applied for service unless the charge is based on debt and fixed operating expenses. A reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge may not exceed 60% of the average sanitary sewer bill for a residential customer in the same sewer service area for the same billing period. Any authority opting to collect a reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge may not collect the tapping fee until the time as the building permit fee is due. Tapping fees shall not include costs included in the calculation of any other fees, assessments, rates or other charges imposed under this act. (i) The fees may include any of the following if they are separately set forth in a resolution adopted by the authority: (A) Connection fee. A connection fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of the connection of the property extending from the authority's main to the property line or curb stop of the property connected. The authority may also base the connection fee upon an average cost for previously installed connections of similar type and size. Such average cost may be trended to current cost using published cost indexes. In lieu of payment of the fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requested the connection. (B) Customer facilities fee. A customer facilities fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of facilities serving the connected property from the property line or curb stop to the proposed dwelling or building to be served. The fee shall be chargeable only if the authority installs the customer facilities. In lieu of payment of the customer facilities fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requests customer facilities. In the case of water service, the fee may include the cost of a water meter and installation if the authority provides or installs the water meter. If the property connected or to be connected with the sewer system of the authority is not equipped with a water meter, the authority may install a meter at its own cost and expense. If the property is supplied with water from the facilities of a public water supply agency, the authority shall not install a meter without the consent and approval of the public water supply agency. (C) Tapping fee. A tapping fee shall not exceed an amount based upon some or all of the following parts which shall be separately set forth in the resolution adopted by the authority to establish these fees. In lieu of payment of this fee, an authority may require the construction and dedication of only such capacity, distribution-collection or special purpose facilities necessary to supply service to the property owner or owners. (I) Capacity part. The capacity part shall not exceed an amount that is based upon the cost of capacity-related facilities, including, but not limited to, source of supply, treatment, pumping, transmission, trunk, interceptor and outfall mains, storage, sludge treatment or disposal, interconnection or other general system facilities. Except as specifically provided in this paragraph, such facilities may include only those that provide existing service. The cost of capacity-related facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon their historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities. To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost. Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable. Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers. The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section. For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities. The capacity part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the total cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the system design capacity of all such facilities. Where the cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future are included in the calculation of the capacity part as permitted herein, the total cost of the facilities shall be divided by the system design capacity plus the additional capacity to be provided by the facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future. An authority may allocate its capacity-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional capacity-related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers. The cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future that will increase the system design capacity may be included in the calculation of the capacity part, subject to the provisions of clause (VI). The cost of such facilities shall not exceed their reasonable estimated cost set forth in a duly adopted annual budget or a five-year capital improvement plan. The authority shall have taken at least two of the following actions toward construction of the facilities: (a) obtained financing for the facilities; (b) entered into a contract obligating the authority to construct or pay for the cost of construction of the facilities or its portion thereof in the event that multiple parties are constructing the facilities; (c) obtained a permit for the facilities; (d) obtained title to or condemned additional real estate upon which the facilities will be constructed; (e) entered into a contract obligating the authority to purchase or acquire facilities owned by another; (f) prepared an engineering feasibility study specifically related to the facilities, which study recommends the construction of the facilities within a five-year period; (g) entered into a contract for the design or construction of the facilities or adopted a budget which includes the use of in-house resources for the design or construction of the facilities. (II) Distribution or collection part. The distribution or collection part may not exceed an amount based upon the cost of distribution or collection facilities required to provide service, such as mains, hydrants and pumping stations. Facilities may only include those that provide existing service. The cost of distribution or collections facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities. To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of replacement cost. Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable. Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers. The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section. For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities. The distribution or collection part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities divided by the design capacity. An authority may allocate its distribution-related or collection-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional distribution-related or collection-related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers. (III) Special purpose part. A part for special purpose facilities shall be applicable only to a particular group of customers or for serving a particular purpose or a specific area based upon the cost of the facilities, including, but not limited to, booster pump stations, fire service facilities, water or sewer mains, pumping stations and industrial wastewater treatment facilities. Such facilities may include only those that provide existing service. The cost of special purpose facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities. To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost. Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable. Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers. The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section. For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities. The special purpose part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of such special purpose facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the design capacity of the facilities. Where an authority constructs special purpose facilities at its own expense, the design capacity for the facilities may be expressed in terms of the number of equivalent dwelling units to be served by the facilities. In no event shall an authority continue to collect any tapping fee which includes a special purpose part after special purpose part fees have been imposed on the total number of design capacity units used in the original calculation of the special purpose part. An authority may allocate its special purpose facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional special purpose tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers. (IV) Reimbursement part. The reimbursement part shall only be applicable to the users of certain specific facilities when a fee required to be collected from such users will be reimbursed to the person at whose expense the facilities were constructed as set forth in a written agreement between the authority and such person at whose expense such facilities were constructed. (V) Calculation of tapping fee. (a) In arriving at the cost to be included in the tapping fee, the same cost shall not be included in more than one part of the tapping fee. (b) No tapping fee may be based upon or include the cost of expanding, replacing, updating or upgrading facilities serving only existing customers in order to meet stricter efficiency, environmental, regulatory or safety standards or to provide better service to or meet the needs of existing customers. (c) The cost used in calculating tapping fees shall not include maintenance and operation expenses. (d) As used in this subclause, \"maintenance and operation expenses\" are those expenditures made during the useful life of a sewer or water system for labor, materials, utilities, equipment accessories, appurtenances and other items which are necessary to manage and maintain the system capacity and performance and to provide the service for which the system was constructed. Costs or expenses to reduce or eliminate groundwater infiltration or inflow may not be included in the cost of facilities used to calculate tapping fees unless these costs or expenses result in an increase in system design capacity. (e) Except as otherwise provided for the calculation of a special purpose part, the design capacity required by a new residential customer used in calculating sewer or water tapping fees shall not exceed an amount established by multiplying 65 gallons per capita per day for water capacity, 90 gallons per capita per day for sewer capacity times the average number of persons per household as established by the most recent census data provided by the United States Census Bureau. If an authority service area is entirely within a municipal boundary for which there is corresponding census data specifying the average number of persons per household, issued by the United States Census Bureau, the average shall be used. If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal boundary but is entirely within a county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has provided the average number of persons per household, then that average for the county or geographic area shall be used. If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal, county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has calculated an average number of persons per household, then the Pennsylvania average number of persons per household shall be used as published by the United States Census Bureau. Alternatively, the design capacity required for a new residential customer shall be determined by a study but shall not exceed: (i) for water capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer, or, for sewage capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer plus ten percent. The average residential water consumption shall be determined by dividing the total water consumption for all metered residential customers in the authority's service area over at least a 12-consecutive-month period within the most recent five years by the average number of customers during the period; or (ii) for sewer capacity, the average sewage flow per residential customer determined by a measured sewage flow study. Such study shall be completed in accordance with sound engineering practices within the most recent five years for the lesser of three or all residential subdivisions of more than ten lots which have collection systems in good repair and which connected to the authority's facilities within the most recent five years. The study shall calculate the average sewage flow per residential customer in such developments by measuring actual sewage flows over at least 12 consecutive months at the points where such developments connected to the authority's sewer main. (iii) All data and other information considered or obtained by an authority in connection with determining capacity under this subsection shall be made available to the public upon request. (iv) If any person required to pay a tapping fee submits to the authority an opinion from a professional engineer that challenges the validity of the results of the calculation of design capacity required to serve new residential customers prepared under subparagraph (i) or (ii), the authority shall within 30 days obtain a written certification from another professional engineer, who is not an employee of the authority, verifying that the results and the calculations, methodology and measurement were performed in accordance with this title and generally accepted engineering practices. If an authority does not obtain a certification required under this subsection within 30 days of receiving such challenge, the authority may not impose or collect tapping fees based on any such challenged calculations or study until such engineering certification is obtained. (f) An authority may use lower design capacity requirements and impose lower tapping fees for multifamily residential dwellings than imposed on other types of residential customers. (VI) Separate accounting for future facility costs. Any portion of tapping fees collected which, based on facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future in accordance with this section, shall be separately accounted for and shall be expended only for that particular facility or a substitute facility accomplishing the same purpose which is commenced within the same period. Such accounting shall include, but not be limited to, the total fees collected as a result of including facilities to be constructed in the future, the source of the fees collected and the amount of fees expended on specific facilities. The proportionate share of tapping fees based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future under this section shall be refunded to the payor of such fees within 90 days of the occurrence of the following: (a) the authority abandons its plan or a part thereof to construct or acquire a facility or facilities which are the basis for such fee; or (b) the facilities have not been placed into service within seven years, or, for an authority which provides service to five or more municipalities, the facilities have not been placed into service within 20 years, after adoption of a resolution which imposes tapping fees which are based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future. Any refund of fees held for 20 years shall include interest for the period the money was held. (VII) Definitions. As used in this clause, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subclause: \"BOD5.\" The five-day biochemical-oxygen demand. \"Design capacity.\" For residential customers, the permitted or rated capacity of facilities expressed in million gallons per day. For nonresidential customers, design capacity may also be expressed in pounds of BOD5 per day, pounds of suspended solids per day or any other capacity-defining parameter that is separately and specifically set forth in the permit governing the operation of the system and based upon its original design as modified by those regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over these facilities. Additionally, for separate fire service customers, the permitted or rated capacity of fire service facilities may be expressed in peak flows. The units of measurement used to express design capacity shall be the same units of measurement used to express the system design capacity. Except as otherwise provided for special purpose facilities, design capacity may not be expressed in terms of equivalent dwelling units. \"Outstanding debt.\" The principal amount outstanding of any bonds, notes, loans or other form of indebtedness used to finance or refinance facilities included in the tapping fee. \"Service line.\" A water or sewer line that directly connects a single building or structure to a distribution or collection facility. \"System design capacity.\" The design capacity of the system for which the tapping fee is being calculated which represents the total design capacity of the treatment facility or water sources. (ii) Every authority charging a tapping, customer facilities or connection fee shall do so only pursuant to a resolution adopted at a public meeting of the authority. The authority shall have available for public inspection a detailed itemization of all calculations, clearly showing the maximum fees allowable for each part of the tapping fee and the manner in which the fees were determined, which shall be made a part of any resolution imposing such fees. A tapping, customer facilities or connection fee may be revised and imposed upon those who subsequently connect to the system, subject to the provisions and limitations of the act. (iii) No authority shall have the power to impose a connection fee, customer facilities fee, tapping fee or similar fee except as provided specifically under this section. (iv) A municipality or municipal authority with available excess sewage capacity, wishing to sell a portion of that capacity to another municipality or municipal authority, may not charge a higher cost for the capacity portion of the tapping fee as the selling entity charges to its customers for the capacity portion of the tapping fee. In turn, the municipality or municipal authority buying this excess capacity may not charge a higher cost for the capacity portion of the tapping fee to its residential customers than that charged to them by the selling entity. (v) As used in this paragraph, the term \"residential customer\" shall also include those developing property for residential dwellings that require multiple tapping fee permits. This paragraph shall not be applicable to intermunicipal or interauthority agreements relative to the purchase of excess capacity by an authority or municipality in effect prior to February 20, 2001. (25) To construct tunnels, bridges, viaducts, underpasses or other structures and relocate the facilities of public service companies to effect or permit the abolition of a grade crossing or grade crossings subject to approval of and in accordance with a duly issued order of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. A commission order shall provide that costs payable by a public utility, political subdivision, the Commonwealth or others shall be payable to the authority. Before proceedings are instituted before the commission, the authority and the public utilities or the political subdivisions shall enter an agreement to provide for the conveyance to the authority of title to the land, structure or improvement involved as security for bonds issued to finance the improvement and the leasing of the improvement to the utility or utilities or the political subdivision or subdivisions involved on such terms as will provide for interest and sinking fund charges on the bonds issued for the improvement. (26) To appoint police officers who shall have the same rights as other peace officers in this Commonwealth with respect to the property of the authority. (27) (i) In the case of an authority created to provide business improvements and administrative services, to impose an assessment on each benefited property within a business improvement district. This assessment shall be based upon the estimated cost of the improvements and services in the district stated in the planning or feasibility study and shall be determined by one of the following methods: (A) The authority may determine an assessment determined by multiplying the total improvement and service cost by the ratio of the assessed value for real estate tax purposes of the benefited property to the total assessed value of all benefited properties in the district. (B) The authority may determine assessments upon the several properties in the district in proportion to benefits as ascertained by viewers appointed in accordance with municipal law. (C) If the district served by the authority contains single-family residential properties, including those that are part of a planned unit development, residential cooperative properties or condominium properties formed under 68 Pa.C.S. Pt. II Subpt. B (relating to condominiums) and other properties, the authority may elect to calculate assessments based on all of the following: (I) The business improvement district assessed value of each benefited single-family or residential cooperative property shall be one-half of the assessed value of the property for real estate tax purposes. (II) In the case of a condominium, the unit owners' association formed under 68 Pa.C.S. Pt. II Subpt. B shall be assessed. Individual units may not be assessed. The business improvement district assessed value of the unit owners' association shall be the sum of the assessed value for real estate tax purposes of any real estate owned by the association and such assessed value of all units, including their undivided interests in the common elements and any limited common elements, except that the value of any single-family residential unit shall be one-half of such assessed value of the unit for real estate tax purposes. The authority shall provide to the unit owners' association the calculation of the business improvement district assessed value of the unit owners' association, itemizing the assessed value of each unit as provided in this clause. The unit owners' association shall add to the condominium fee charged to a unit owner the amount of the district assessment attributable to the unit which amount shall be separately itemized on any assessment, invoice, bill or other document presented to the unit owner for payment of the condominium fee. (III) The district assessment shall be calculated on each benefited single-family residential property, benefited residential cooperative property and benefited unit owners' association by multiplying in each case the total improvement and services cost by the ratio of the district assessed value of the benefited single-family residential property, benefited residential cooperative property or benefited unit owners' association to the sum of the district assessed value of all benefited single-family residential properties, the district assessed value of all residential cooperative properties, the district assessed value of all benefited unit owners' associations and the assessed value of all remaining benefited properties in the business improvement district. (IV) The remaining benefited properties shall be assessed by multiplying in each case the total improvement and services cost by the ratio of the assessed value of the remaining benefited property to the sum of the district assessed value of all benefited single-family residential properties, the district assessed value of all residential cooperative properties, the district assessed value of all benefited unit owners' associations and the assessed value of all remaining benefited properties in the business improvement district. (V) An election by an authority under this clause shall not be revoked except through the procedures stated in subparagraph (ii) and subsection (g). (ii) An assessment or charge may not be made unless: (A) An authority submits a plan for business improvements and administrative services, together with estimated costs and the proposed method of assessments for business improvements and charges for administrative services, to the municipality in which the project is to be undertaken. (B) The municipality approves the plan, the estimated costs and the proposed method of assessment and charges. (iii) An authority may not assess charges against the improved properties in an aggregate amount in excess of the estimated cost. (iv) An authority may by resolution authorize payment of an assessment or charge in equal, annual or more frequent installments over a fixed period of time and bearing interest of 6% or less. If bonds, notes or guarantees are used to raise revenue to provide for the cost of improvements or services, the installments shall not be payable beyond the term for which the bonds, notes or guarantees are payable. (v) Claims to secure the payment of assessments shall be entered in the prothonotary's office of the county at the same time and in the same form and shall be collected in the same manner as municipal claims are filed and collected notwithstanding the provisions of this section as to installment payments. (vi) In case of default of 60 days or more after an installment is due, the entire assessment and interest shall be due. (vii) An owner of property against whom an assessment has been made may pay the assessment in full at any time along with accrued interest and costs. Upon proof of payment the lien shall be discharged. (viii) For purposes of determining assessments in accordance with subparagraph (i)(A) and (C), the assessed value of a benefited property shall be without reduction for any value attributable to improvements for which an exemption or abatement has been granted under law. (ix) Any claim entered to secure the payment of an assessment against a unit owners' association shall be enforceable as a judgment for money against the unit owners' association within the meaning of and under the provisions of 68 Pa.C.S. § 3319 (relating to other liens affecting the condominium), provided that if an assessment against a unit owners' association is paid in part and the unit owners' association specifies in writing to the authority the units with respect to which full payment was made, the claim shall not be enforceable against units with respect to which full payment was made or against the unit owners' association. An authority shall discharge a lien against a unit owners' association to the extent that it constitutes a lien on a particular unit upon proof of payment, either to the unit owners' association or to the authority, by the owner of the particular unit of his itemized share of the assessment on the unit owners' association. (x) An authority that has made an election under subparagraph (i)(C) may further elect to calculate, for the assessment years included in a plan and budget, the assessments on single-family residential properties, including those that are part of a planned unit development, residential cooperative properties and residential condominium properties, at the lower of the amount determined under subparagraph (i)(C) or that aggregate value of assessments that will not exceed 5% of the authority's total annual assessments, subject to the following: (A) Any aggregate reduction in assessments on residential properties shall increase the assessments on the remaining properties in proportion to the assessments of the remaining properties calculated under subparagraph (i)(C)(IV). (B) Any further election shall be made for all assessment years included in a plan and budget, except that, for a current plan and budget, the further election shall be made for the years remaining in the plan and budget. Once made, the further election shall remain in effect for all such assessment years included in the plan and budget. (C) An authority making the further election shall hold a hearing on the proposed method of calculation. Written notice of the hearing shall be given to all owners of properties assessed by the district at least 30 days prior to the hearing. The notice shall state the proposed method of calculation. (D) The authority shall take no action on the proposed method of calculation if objection is made in writing by owners of properties representing one-third of the amount of all assessments in the district. In the case of a condominium formed under 68 Pa.C.S. Pt. II Subpt. B, the condominium association and all condominium units shall be treated as one property, valued in the manner described in subparagraph (i)(C)(II). Any objection must be made within 30 days of the hearing in writing signed by the property owner and filed in the registered office of the authority. (E) No further hearing shall be required, no amendment of the authority's plan and budget shall be required and no action on the part of the municipality shall be required. (28) To adopt rules and regulations to provide for the safety of persons using facilities of an airport authority pertaining to vehicular traffic control. Police officers appointed under paragraph (26) shall enforce them. (29) To provide financing for insurance reserves by making loans evidenced and secured by loan agreements, security agreements or other instruments or agreements. These instruments or agreements may contain provisions the authority deems necessary or desirable for the security or protection of the authority or its bondholders. (30) Where a sewer or water system of an authority is to be extended at the expense of the owner of properties or where the authority otherwise would construct customer facilities referred to in paragraph (24), other than water meter installation, a property owner shall have the right to construct the extension or install the customer facilities himself or through a subcontractor approved by the authority, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The authority shall have the right, at its option, to perform the construction itself only if the authority provides the extension or customer facilities at a lower cost and within the same timetable specified or proposed by the property owner or his approved subcontractor. Construction by the property owner shall be in accordance with an agreement for the extension of the authority's system and plans and specifications approved by the authority and shall be undertaken only pursuant to the existing regulations, requirements, rules and standards of the authority applicable to such construction. Construction shall be subject to inspection by an inspector authorized to approve similar construction and employed by the authority during construction. When a main is to be extended at the expense of the owner of properties, the property owner may be required to deposit with the authority, in advance of construction, the authority's estimated reasonable and necessary cost of reviewing plans, construction inspections, administrative, legal and engineering services. The authority may require that construction shall not commence until the property owner has posted appropriate financial security in accordance with paragraph (23). The authority may require the property owner to reimburse it for reasonable and necessary expenses it incurred as a result of the extension. If an independent firm is employed for engineering review of the plans and the inspection of improvements, reimbursement for its services shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the independent firm for work performed for similar services in the community. The fees shall not exceed the rate or cost charged by the independent firm to the authority when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants. Upon completion of construction, the property owner shall dedicate and the authority shall accept the extension of the authority's system if dedication of facilities and the installation complies with the plans, specifications, regulations of the authority and the agreement. An authority may provide in its regulations those facilities which, having been constructed at the expense of the owner of properties, the authority will require to be dedicated and which facility or facilities the authority will accept as a part of its system. (i) In the event the property owner disputes the amount of any billing in connection with the review of plans, construction inspections, administrative, legal and engineering services, the property owner shall, within 60 days of the date of billing, notify the authority that the billing is disputed as excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the authority shall not delay or disapprove any application or any approval or permit related to the extension or facilities due to the property owner's dispute over the disputed billings unless the property owner has failed to make payment in accordance with the decision rendered under clause (iii) within 60 days after the mailing date of such decision. (ii) If, within 60 days from the date of billing, the authority and the property owner cannot agree on the amount of billings which are reasonable and necessary, the property owner shall have the right to request the appointment of another professional consultant to serve as arbitrator. The property owner and the authority whose fees are being challenged shall, by mutual agreement, appoint a professional of the same profession or discipline licensed in Pennsylvania to review the billings and make a determination as to the amount of billings which is reasonable and necessary. (iii) The professional appointed as arbitrator under clause (ii) shall hear evidence and review the documentation as the professional in his or her sole opinion deems necessary and shall render a decision within 50 days of the date of appointment. Based upon the decision of the arbitrator, the property owner or authority shall be required to pay any amounts necessary to implement the decision within 60 days. In the event the property owner has paid the authority or retained professional consultant an amount in excess of the amount determined to be reasonable and necessary, the authority or retained professional consultant shall within 60 days reimburse the excess payment. (iv) In the event that the authority and property owner cannot agree upon the professional to be appointed within 20 days of the request for appointment of an arbitrator, the president judge of the court of common pleas of the judicial district in which the municipality is located, or if at the time there is no president judge, the senior active judge then sitting upon application of either party shall appoint a professional, who shall be neither the authority engineer nor any professional who has been retained by or performed services for the authority or the property owner within the preceding five years. (v) The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid by the property owner if the disputed fee is upheld by the arbitrator. The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid by the authority if the disputed fee is $2,500 or greater than the payment decided by the arbitrator. The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid in an equal amount by the property owner and the authority if the disputed fee is less than $2,500 of the payment decided by the arbitrator. (vi) In the event that the disputed fees have been paid and the arbitrator finds that the disputed fees are unreasonable or excessive by more than $10,000, the arbitrator shall: (A) award the amount of the fees found to be unreasonable or excessive to the party that paid the disputed fee; and (B) impose a surcharge of 4% of the amount found as unreasonable or excessive to be paid to the party that paid the disputed fee. (vii) An authority or property owner shall have 100 days after paying a fee to dispute any fee charged as being unreasonable or excessive. (31) Where a property owner constructs or causes to be constructed at his expense any extension of a sewer or water system of an authority, the authority shall provide for the reimbursement to the property owner when the owner of another property not in the development for which the extension was constructed connects a service line directly to the extension within ten years of the date of the dedication of the extension to the authority in accordance with the following provisions: (i) Reimbursement shall be equal to the distribution or collection part of each tapping fee collected as a result of subsequent connections. An authority may deduct from each reimbursement payment an amount equal to 5% of it for administrative expenses and services rendered in calculating, collecting, monitoring and disbursing the reimbursement payments to the property owner. (ii) Reimbursement shall be limited to those lines which have not previously been paid for by the authority. (iii) The authority shall, in preparing necessary reimbursement agreements with a property owner for whose benefit reimbursement will be provided, attach as an exhibit an itemized listing of all sewer and water facilities for which reimbursement shall be provided. (iv) The total reimbursement which a property owner may receive may not exceed the cost of labor and material, engineering design charges, the cost of performance and maintenance bonds, authority review and inspection charges as well as flushing and televising charges and any and all charges involved in the acceptance and dedication of such facilities by the authority, less the amount which would be chargeable to the property owner based upon the authority's collection and distribution tapping fees which would be applicable to all lands of the property owner directly or indirectly served through extensions if the property owner did not fund the extension. (v) An authority shall notify by certified mail, to the last known address, the property owner for whose benefit a reimbursement shall apply. This shall be done within 30 days of the authority's receipt of the reimbursement payment. If a property owner does not claim a reimbursement payment within 120 days after the mailing of the notice, the payment shall become the sole property of the authority with no further obligation on the part of the authority to refund the payment to the property owner. (32) (Deleted by amendment). (33) Provisions of paragraphs (30) and (31) shall apply to residential customers in a municipality where the sewer service is being purchased by the municipality or sewer authority from another municipality or sewer authority having excess sewage capacity. (34) In the case of an authority that performs storm water planning, management and implementation, reasonable and uniform rates may be based in whole or in part on property characteristics, which may include installation and maintenance of best management practices approved and inspected by the authority. (e) Prohibition.-- (1) An authority may not pledge the credit or taxing power of the Commonwealth or its political subdivision. (2) The obligations of an authority are not obligations of the Commonwealth or its political subdivision. (3) Neither the Commonwealth nor a political subdivision shall be liable for the payment of principal of or interest on obligations of an authority. (f) Authorization to control airports.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent an authority which owns or operates an airport as a project from leasing airport land on a short-term or long-term basis for commercial, industrial or residential purposes when the land is not immediately needed for aviation or aeronautical purposes in the judgment of the authority. (g) Authorization to make business improvements and provide administrative services.-- An authority may be established to make business improvements or provide administrative services in districts designated by a municipality or by municipalities acting jointly and zoned commercial or used for general commercial purposes or in contiguous areas if the inclusion of a contiguous area is directly related to the improvements and services proposed by the authority. The authority shall make planning or feasibility studies to determine needed improvements or administrative services. The following shall also apply: (1) The authority shall be required to hold a public hearing on the proposed improvement or service, the estimated costs thereof and the proposed method of assessment and charges. Notice of the hearing shall be advertised at least ten days before it occurs in a newspaper whose circulation is within the municipality where the authority is established. At the public hearing any interested party may be heard. (2) Written notice of the proposed improvement or service, its estimated cost, the proposed method of assessment and charges and project cost to individual property owners shall be given to each property owner and commercial lessee in benefited properties in the district at least 30 days prior to the public hearing. (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (4), the authority shall take no action on proposed improvement or service if objection is made in writing by: (i) persons representing the ownership of one-third of the benefited properties in the district; or (ii) property owners of the proposed district whose property valuation as assessed for taxable purposes shall amount to more than one-third of the total property valuation of the district. (4) In the case of an authority that has elected to make assessments under subsection (d)(27)(i)(C), the objections in writing must be made by either: (i) one-third of the owners of benefited commercial properties; or (ii) owners of properties representing one-third of the amount of all business improvement district assessments for the first year of the proposed plan and budget after the reduction in district assessments under subsection (d)(27)(i)(C). For purposes of calculating one-third of the benefited commercial properties, the term benefited commercial properties shall include all nonresidential property, each condominium association formed under 68 Pa.C.S. Pt. II Subpt. B as one property and may not include any individual condominium so formed nor any single-family residential property. (5) Objection must be made within 45 days after the conclusion of the public hearing. Objections must be in writing, signed and filed in the office of the governing body of the municipality in which the district is located and in the registered office of the authority.

(4) In each successive year in which there is a positive percentage change in the CPI-U for the United States City Average, the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by the most recent preliminary adjusted amounts, and the products shall be added to the preliminary adjusted amount of the prior year to calculate the preliminary adjusted amounts for the current year. The sums thereof shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the new final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a)(1), (b) and (c). (5) The determinations and adjustments required under this subsection shall be made in the period between October 1 and November 15 of the year following the effective date of this subsection and annually between October 1 and November 15 of each year thereafter.

(2) This subsection is intended to make unlawful the practice of evading advertising requirements by making a series of purchases or contracts each for less than the advertising requirement price or by making several simultaneous purchases or contracts each below that price when in either case the transaction involved should have been made as one transaction for one price. (3) An authority member who votes to unlawfully evade the provisions of this section and who knows that the transaction upon which the member votes is or ought to be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids commits a misdemeanor of the third degree for each contract entered into as a direct result of that vote.

(a) Amount of annuity.-- A member who has made application for a disability annuity and has been found to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of section 5905(c)(1) (relating to duties of the board regarding applications and elections of members and participants) shall receive a disability annuity payable from the effective date of disability as determined by the board and continued until a subsequent determination by the board that the annuitant is no longer entitled to a disability annuity. If the sum of the products of the number of years and fractional part of a year of credited service in each class and the appropriate class of service multiplier is greater than 16.667, the disability annuity shall be a single life annuity that is equal to the sum of the standard single life annuities determined separately for each class of service multiplied by the appropriate class of service multiplier, otherwise each standard single life annuity shall be multiplied by the lesser of the following ratios: MY*/Y or 16.667/Y Where Y = total number of years of credited service; Y* = total years of credited service if the member were to continue as a State employee until attaining superannuation age as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, or if the member has attained superannuation age, as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, then the number of years of credited service and M = the class of service multiplier as applicable to that class of service at the effective date of disability. A member of Class C shall receive, in addition, any annuity to which he may be eligible under section 5702(a)(3) (relating to maximum single life annuity). The member shall be entitled to the election of a joint and survivor annuity on that portion of the disability annuity to which he is entitled under section 5702. (b) Benefit attributable to social security integration credit.-- If the member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and has social security integration credits as provided in section 5305 (relating to social security integration credits), he may elect to withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions or if he has five or more eligibility points to his credit and does not withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions he may execute an application to be filed with the board to receive, in addition to his disability annuity, an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702(a)(2). (c) Reduction on account of earned income.-- Subsequent to January 1, 1972, payments on account of disability shall be reduced by that amount by which the earned income of the annuitant, as reported in accordance with section 5908(b) (relating to rights and duties of annuitants), for the preceding calendar year together with the disability annuity payments provided in this section other than subsection (b), for the year, exceeds the product of: (1) the last year's salary of the annuitant as a member of the system; and (2) the ratio of the current monthly payment to the monthly payment at the effective date of disability; Provided, That the annuitant shall not receive less than his member's annuity or the amount to which he may be entitled under section 5702 whichever is greater. (d) Reduction on account of ineligibility.-- Payment of that portion of the disability annuity in excess of the annuity to which the annuitant was entitled at the effective date of disability calculated in accordance with section 5702 shall cease if the annuitant is no longer eligible under the provisions of sections 5905(c)(2) or 5908(b) or (c). (e) Termination of State service.-- Upon termination of disability annuity payments in excess of an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702, a disability annuitant who does not return to State service may file an application with the board for an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of the shared-risk accumulated deductions plus the regular and additional accumulated deductions standing to his credit at the effective date of disability over one-third of the total disability annuity payments received. If the annuitant on the date of termination of service was eligible for an annuity as provided in section 5308(a) or (b) (relating to eligibility for annuities), he may file an application with the board for an election of an optional modification of his annuity.

(f) Supplement for service connected disability.-- (1) If a member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and if the disability has been found to be a service connected disability and if the member is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits, such member shall receive a supplement equal to the amount determined under paragraph (2) less the sum of the annuity as determined under subsection (a) and any payments paid or payable on account of such disability under the act of June 2, 1915 (P.L.736, No.338), known as the Workers' Compensation Act, the act of June 21, 1939 (P.L.566, No.284), known as The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act, and the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.). Such supplement shall continue as long as he is determined to be disabled and is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits on account of his service connected disability in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act or The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act. If the member has received a lump sum workers' compensation payment in lieu of future weekly compensation payments, the length in weeks and calculation of the service connected disability supplement shall be determined by dividing the lump sum payment by the average weekly wage as determined by the Workers' Compensation Board. (2) For a member who does not have Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be 70% of the member's final average salary. For a member who has Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be calculated according to the following formula: A = .7[(Y W MULTIPLIED BY FAS W )+(Y P MULTIPLIED BY FAS P )] Y T Y T (3) The following apply to the formula in paragraph (2): (i) A equals the amount used to determine the supplement; (ii) Y T equals total years of credited service; (iii) Y W equals years of credited service that are not Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (iv) FAS W equals final average salary calculated for credited service other than Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (v) Y P equals years of service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; and (vi) FAS P equals final average salary calculated for service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service. (g) Limitation regarding annual benefit under IRC § 415.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this part to the contrary, no benefit shall be payable to the extent that such benefit exceeds any limitation under IRC § 415 as in effect with respect to governmental plans as such term is defined in IRC § 414(d) on the date the benefit payment becomes effective, provided however, that any increase in any limitation under IRC § 415 shall be applicable to all current and future annuitants and survivor annuitants. (h) Coordination of benefits.-- The determination and payment of a disability annuity under this section is in addition to any payments a member may be entitled to receive, has received or is receiving as a result of being a participant in the plan.

(a) General rule.-- In order to prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards, every municipality having an airport hazard area within its territorial limits shall adopt, administer and enforce, under the police power and in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in this subchapter and in applicable zoning law unless clearly inconsistent with this subchapter, airport zoning regulations for such airport hazard area. The regulations may divide the area into zones and, within the zones, specify the land uses permitted and regulate and restrict the height to which structures may be erected or objects of natural growth may be allowed to grow. A municipality which includes an airport hazard area created by the location of a public airport is required to adopt, administer and enforce zoning ordinances pursuant to this subchapter if the existing comprehensive zoning ordinance for the municipality does not provide for the land uses permitted and regulate and restrict the height to which structures may be erected or objects of natural growth may be allowed to grow in an airport hazard area. (b) Joint airport zoning board.-- Where any airport hazard area appertaining to an airport is located outside the territorial limits of the municipality encompassing the airport, all of the municipalities involved may, by ordinance or resolution, create a joint airport zoning board which shall have the same power to adopt, administer and enforce airport zoning regulations applicable to the airport hazard area in question as that vested by subsection (a) in the municipality within which the area is located. Each joint airport zoning board shall have as members two representatives appointed by each municipality participating in its creation and, in addition, a chairman elected by a majority of the members so appointed. (c) Definition.-- As used in this section the word \"airport\" does not include facilities designated as heliports and which can be used only by rotary wing aircraft, nor airports which are private airports.

The planning agency shall make a preliminary report and, after notice given in the same manner as is provided in subsection (a), shall hold public hearings thereon before submitting its final report.

(b) Nonconforming uses.-- No airport zoning regulations adopted under this subchapter may require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or any object of natural growth not conforming to the regulations when adopted or amended or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use, except as provided in section 5916 (relating to permits and variances).

However, all regulations shall provide that before any nonconforming structure may be replaced, substantially altered or rebuilt or tree allowed to grow higher or replanted, a permit must be secured from the municipality authorizing the replacement or change. Applications for permits shall only be granted unless to do so would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming structure or object of natural growth or nonconforming use to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. (b) Variance.-- Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth of any object of natural growth or otherwise use his property in violation of airport zoning regulations may apply to the board for a variance from the zoning regulations in question. A variance shall only be granted after the requirements of section 5919 (relating to notice to department) are satisfied. A variance may be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but would do substantial justice and would be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this subchapter.

(c) Hazard marking and lighting.-- In granting any permit or variance under this section, the board shall, if it deems the action advisable to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter and reasonable in the circumstances, so condition the permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person or persons requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be required by guidelines or regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States Department of Transportation.

(a) Single child support order.-- If a proceeding is brought under this part and only one tribunal has issued a child support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized. (a.1) Multiple orders.-- If a proceeding is brought under this part and two or more child support orders have been issued by tribunals of this State, another state or a foreign country with regard to the same obligor and same child, a tribunal of this State having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the individual obligee shall apply the following rules and by order shall determine which order controls and must be recognized: (1) If only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the order of that tribunal controls. (2) If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, an order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls and must be so recognized, but, if an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls and must be so recognized. (3) If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the tribunal of this State shall issue a child support order, which controls. (a.2) Request to determine controlling order.-- If two or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and the same child, upon request of a party who is an individual or which is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this State having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under subsection (a.1). The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification under Chapter 76 (relating to registration, enforcement and modification of support order) or may be filed as a separate proceeding. The request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child support order in effect and the applicable record of payments. The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination. (b) Exclusive jurisdiction.-- The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection (a), (a.1) or (a.2) is the tribunal that has continuing jurisdiction under section 7205 (relating to continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify child support orders) or 7206 (relating to continuing jurisdiction to enforce child support orders). (c) Basis of order.-- A tribunal of this State which determines by order the identity of the controlling order under subsection (a.1)(1) or (2) or (a.2) or which issues a new controlling order under subsection (a.1)(3) shall state all of the following in that order: (1) The basis upon which the tribunal made its determination. (2) The amount of prospective support, if any. (3) The total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are credited under section 7209 (relating to credit for payments). (d) Filing of copy of order.-- Within 30 days after issuance of an order determining the identity of the controlling order, the party obtaining the determining order shall file a certified copy of it with each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement agency that obtains a determining order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. Failure to file a copy of the determining order does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order. (e) Recognition.-- An order which has been determined to be the controlling order or a judgment for consolidated arrears of support and interest, if any, made under this section must be recognized in proceedings under this part.

(a) General rule.-- Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), if a particular charitable purpose becomes unlawful, impracticable or wasteful: (1) the trust does not fail, in whole or in part; (2) the trust property does not revert to the settlor or the settlor's successors in interest; and (3) the court shall apply cy pres to fulfill as nearly as possible the settlor's charitable intention, whether it be general or specific. (b) Exception.-- A provision in the terms of a charitable trust that would result in distribution of the trust property to a noncharitable beneficiary prevails over the power of the court under subsection (a) to apply cy pres. (c) Administrative deviation.-- A court may modify an administrative provision of a charitable trust to the extent necessary to preserve the trust. (d) Administrative termination of small charitable trusts.-- A trust solely for charitable purposes having assets of less than $100,000 may be terminated at its inception or at any time thereafter by the trustee with the consent of the Attorney General and all charitable organizations that are designated as beneficiaries by name in the trust instrument. Upon termination, the assets, subject to the approval of the Attorney General, shall be delivered to the organizations, if any, designated in the trust instrument or, if none, to organizations selected by the trustee, in either case to be held and applied for the general or specific charitable purposes and on the terms that will, in the trustee's discretion, fulfill as nearly as possible the settlor's intention. (e) Judicial termination of charitable trusts.-- If the separate existence of a trust, whenever created, solely for charitable purposes results or will result in administrative expense or other burdens unreasonably out of proportion to the charitable benefits, the court may, upon application of the trustee or any interested person and after notice to the Attorney General, terminate the trust, either at its inception or at any time thereafter, and award the assets outright, free of the trust, to the charitable organizations, if any, designated in the trust instrument or, if none, to charitable organizations selected by the court, in either case for the purposes and on the terms that the court may direct to fulfill as nearly as possible the settlor's intentions other than any intent to continue the trust, if the court is satisfied that the charitable organizations will properly use or administer the assets.

Neither a compensation provision in the terms of a trust nor a fee agreement governs compensation payable from trust principal unless it explicitly so provides. (b) If specified; adjustment.-- If the terms of a trust or written fee agreement signed by the settlor or anyone who is authorized by the terms of the trust to do so specifies a trustee's compensation, the trustee is entitled to the specified compensation. The court may allow reasonable compensation that is more or less than that specified if: (1) the duties of the trustee have become substantially different from those contemplated when the trust was created or when the fee agreement was executed; (2) the compensation specified in the terms of the trust or fee agreement would be unreasonable; or (3) the trustee performed extraordinary services, and the trustee's compensation for those services is not specified in the terms of the trust or fee agreement.

(2) The trustee's term of office has not yet ended. (3) The trustee of a testamentary trust also acted as a personal representative of the settlor and was or might have been compensated for services as a personal representative from the principal of the settlor's estate.

The court may allow compensation from principal, income or both and determine the frequency with which compensation may be collected. Compensation at levels that arise in a competitive market shall be presumed to be reasonable in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary.

(d) Transactions between trustee and beneficiary.-- A transaction between a trustee and a beneficiary that does not concern trust property but that occurs during the existence of the trust or while the trustee retains significant influence over the beneficiary and from which the trustee obtains an advantage is voidable by a court upon application by the beneficiary unless the trustee establishes that the transaction was fair to the beneficiary.

A trustee shall promptly respond to the Department of Human Services' reasonable request for information related to the trust's administration when a settlor or beneficiary is a resident in a State-owned facility or an applicant for or recipient of cash or medical assistance from the Commonwealth and the department certifies in writing that it has obtained a currently valid consent for the disclosure of such information from the settlor or beneficiary of the trust. A trustee may rely upon the department's certification without investigating its accuracy. (b) Notice after settlor of revocable trust has been adjudicated incapacitated.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of a revocable trust learns that the settlor has been adjudicated incapacitated, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to the settlor's guardian. (c) Notice after settlor of revocable trust has died.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of a revocable trust learns that the settlor has died, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to: (1) the settlor's personal representative; (2) the settlor's spouse or, if the settlor's spouse is incapacitated, the spouse's guardian; (3) each of the settlor's children who is sui juris and the guardian, if any, of each child who is not sui juris; and (4) the trust's current beneficiaries. (d) Notice after settlor of irrevocable trust has been adjudicated incapacitated.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of an irrevocable trust learns that the settlor has been adjudicated incapacitated, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to the trust's current beneficiaries. A revocable trust shall not be deemed irrevocable for the purposes of this subsection merely because the settlor has been adjudicated incapacitated. (e) Notice after settlor of irrevocable trust has died.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of an irrevocable trust learns that the settlor has died, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to the trust's current beneficiaries unless the settlor had been adjudicated incapacitated and the trustee sent notices to the current beneficiaries as required by subsection (d). (f) Notice to current beneficiaries.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of an irrevocable trust learns that a person who did not previously receive the notice described in subsection (i) is a current beneficiary of the trust, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to the current beneficiary if, at that time, the trustee knows that the settlor is then deceased or has been adjudicated incapacitated. With respect to a testamentary trust, the time specified in this subsection commences to run when the trust is first funded, whether or not the trust is completely funded on that date. (g) Change in trusteeship.-- (1) Each time there is a change in trusteeship of any trust, the trustee shall notify the settlor in writing of the change. (2) Each time there is a change in trusteeship of any trust whose settlor is deceased or of an irrevocable trust whose settlor has been adjudicated incapacitated, the trustee shall notify the current beneficiaries in writing of the change. (3) Notice under this subsection shall include the trustee's name, address and telephone number. (h) Trustee's notice to any beneficiary at any time.-- Apart from the requirements of this section, the trustee may send the notice described in subsection (i) to any beneficiary of the trust at any time. (i) Contents of notice.-- Except as provided in subsection (g), any notice under this section shall be written and convey the following information: (1) The fact of the trust's existence. (2) The identity of the settlor. (3) The trustee's name, address and telephone number. (4) The recipient's right to receive upon request a copy of the trust instrument. (5) Each current beneficiary's right to receive, at least annually, upon request, periodic written financial reports concerning the trust. (6) The name, address and telephone number of each trust director. (j) Waiver.-- Any beneficiary may waive in writing the right to receive the notice described in subsection (i) and thereafter may rescind in writing that waiver. (k) Notice to settlor's appointee.-- The terms of a trust may provide that the settlor may appoint one or more persons or a succession of persons to receive, on behalf of one or more named current beneficiaries of the trust, the notices required by this section. The trustee giving the notice required by this section to that appointee satisfies the trustee's duty to give to the named current beneficiary the notice required by this section if: (1) the trustee notifies the appointee that the notice is being given to the appointee as representing the named current beneficiary; and (2) the appointee does not decline to receive the notice in a writing delivered to the trustee no later than 30 days after receipt of the trustee's notice. (k.1) Nomination by current beneficiary.-- In a writing given to the trustee, a current beneficiary of a trust may nominate another person to receive, on behalf of the current beneficiary, the notices required by this section. By giving the notices required by this section to the nominee of the current beneficiary, the trustee satisfies the trustee's duty to give to the current beneficiary the notices required by this section if: (1) the trustee notifies the nominee that the notice is being given to the nominee as representative of the current beneficiary and that future notices required by this section will be given to the nominee in the same capacity; and (2) the nominee does not decline to receive the notices on behalf of the current beneficiary in a writing given to the trustee no later than 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (1). (k.2) Reliance on nomination.-- The trustee may rely upon the current beneficiary's nomination of another person to receive the notices required by this section on behalf of the current beneficiary and the nominee's presumed acceptance of that representation under subsection (k.1)(2) until the trustee receives a written rescission of the nomination from the current beneficiary or a written declination to receive further notices from the nominee. No such rescission or declination shall render ineffective any notice given by the trustee to the nominee before the trustee received the rescission or declination. (l) Applicability.-- (1) If the death or adjudication of incapacity described in subsection (b), (c), (d) or (e) occurs on or after November 6, 2006, the time limit for notice set forth in that subsection shall apply. (2) If the death or adjudication of incapacity described in subsection (b), (d) or (e) has occurred before November 6, 2006, the time limit for notice set forth in that subsection shall be November 6, 2008. (3) The notice under subsection (f) shall not be required to be completed until two years after November 6, 2006. (Oct. 27, 2010, P.L.837, No.85; July 8, 2016, P.L.497, No.79, eff.

(a) Imposed by trustee's written reports.-- (1) A beneficiary is barred from challenging a transaction or asserting a claim against a trustee for breach of trust if: (i) the trustee provided the beneficiary at least annually with periodic written financial reports concerning the trust; (ii) the transaction was disclosed in a report to which subparagraph (i) refers or such report provided sufficient information so that the beneficiary knew or should have known of the potential claim or should have inquired into its existence; (iii) in the 30 months after a report to which subparagraph (ii) refers was sent by the trustee to the beneficiary, the beneficiary did not notify the trustee in writing that the beneficiary challenges the transaction or asserts a claim and provides in writing the basis for that challenge or assertion; and (iv) all reports were accompanied by a conspicuous written statement describing the effect of this paragraph. (2) A claim not barred by paragraph (1) may nevertheless be barred by subsection (b). (3) In a writing given to the trustee, a beneficiary of a trust may nominate another person to receive, on behalf of the beneficiary, the reports required by this section. By giving the reports required by this section to the nominee of the beneficiary, the trustee satisfies the trustee's duty to give the beneficiary the reports required by this section if: (i) the trustee notifies the nominee that the report and future reports required by this section are being given to the nominee as representative of the beneficiary; and (ii) the nominee does not decline to receive reports on behalf of the beneficiary in a writing given to the trustee no later than 60 days after receipt of the notice described in this subsection. (4) The trustee may rely upon the beneficiary's nomination of another person to receive the reports required by this section on behalf of the beneficiary and the nominee's presumed acceptance of that representation under this subsection until the trustee receives a written rescission of the nomination from the beneficiary or a written declination to receive further reports from the nominee. No such rescission or declination shall render ineffective any report given by the trustee to the nominee before the trustee received the rescission or declination. (b) Five-year absolute bar.-- If not previously barred by subsection (a) or section 7798 (relating to failure to present claim at audit): (1) Except as provided in paragraph (1.1), (2) or (3), a claim by a beneficiary against a trustee, including a claim preserved by the beneficiary notifying the trustee in the manner described in subsection (a), shall be barred five years after the first to occur of the following events: (i) the date after the removal, resignation or death of the trustee on which the beneficiary was given the notice required by section 7780.3(g) (relating to duty to inform and report); (ii) the termination of the beneficiary's interest in the trust; or (iii) the termination of the trust. (1.1) A beneficiary who has challenged a transaction or asserted a claim as provided in subsection (a)(1)(iii) may not challenge the transaction or assert the claim against the trustee in a court or an arbitration proceeding commenced more than five years after the date the trustee sent the beneficiary the report described in subsection (a)(1)(i) and (ii). (2) Except as set forth in paragraph (3), if the first to occur of the events set forth in paragraph (1) occurred before November 6, 2006, a claim described in paragraph (1) shall be barred five years after November 6, 2006. (3) A claim described in paragraph (1) or (1.1) is not barred if, prior to the respective date set forth in either paragraph (1) or (2), the trustee has filed an account with the court or the beneficiary has petitioned the court to compel the trustee to file an account.

(a.1) Protection from liability.-- Unless a person assisting or dealing with a trustee has actual knowledge that the trustee is committing a breach of trust or has knowledge of such facts that the trustee's conduct amounts to bad faith, the person: (1) may assume without inquiry the existence of trust powers and their proper exercise by the trustee; (2) is not bound to inquire whether the trustee has power to act or is properly exercising the power; and (3) is fully protected in dealing with the trustee as if the trustee possessed and properly exercised the powers the trustee purports to exercise. (b) No requirement to inquire.-- A person other than a beneficiary who in good faith deals with a trustee is not required to inquire into the extent of the trustee's powers or the propriety of their exercise. (c) (Reserved). (c.1) Ultra vires.-- A trustee's act may not be set aside or not specifically enforced because the trustee's act was not authorized by section 7780.5 (relating to powers of trustees - UTC 815) or 7780.6 (relating to illustrative powers of trustee) or because the trustee's act was authorized but the authority was improperly exercised.

(d) Former trustee.-- A person other than a beneficiary who in good faith assists a former trustee, or who in good faith and for value deals with a former trustee, without knowledge that the trusteeship has terminated is protected from liability as if the former trustee were still a trustee.

(2) The identity of the settlor. (3) The identity and address of the currently acting trustee. (4) The powers of the trustee.

(e) Provisions to be made available upon request.-- A recipient of a certification of trust may require the trustee to furnish copies of those excerpts from the original trust instrument and later amendments which designate the trustee and confer upon the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction. (f) Reliance on certification.-- A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without knowledge that the representations contained in the certification are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification. Knowledge of the terms of the trust may not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying upon the certification. (g) Enforcement.-- A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in reliance upon a certification of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification were correct. (h) Liability.-- A person making a demand for the trust instrument in addition to a certification of trust or excerpts is liable for damages if the court determines that the person did not act in good faith in demanding the trust instrument.

(b) Organization of pooled trust.-- (1) A pooled trust shall be administered by a trustee governed by a board. The trust may employ persons as necessary. (2) The members of a board and employees of a trustee, if any, shall stand in a fiduciary relationship to the beneficiaries and the trustee regarding investment of the trust and shall not profit, either directly or indirectly, with respect to the investment. (3) A trustee shall maintain a separate account for each beneficiary of a pooled trust; but, for purposes of investment and management of funds, the trustee may pool these accounts. The trustee shall have exclusive control and authority to manage and invest the money in the pooled trust in accordance with this section, subject, however, to the exercise of that degree of judgment, skill and care under the prevailing circumstances that persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence who are familiar with investment matters exercise in the management of their affairs, considering the probable income to be derived from the investment and the probable safety of their capital. The trustee may charge a trust management fee to cover the costs of administration and management of the pooled trust. (4) A board member shall disclose and abstain from participation in a discussion or voting on an issue if a conflict of interest arises with the board member on a particular issue or vote. (5) No board member may receive compensation for services provided as a member of the board. No fees or commissions may be paid to a board member. A board member may be reimbursed for necessary expenses incurred which are in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the pooled trust as a board member upon presentation of receipts. (6) The trustee shall disburse money from a beneficiary's account for the sole benefit of the beneficiary. A disbursement from a beneficiary's account must have a reasonable relationship to the needs of the beneficiary. (c) Pooled trust fund.-- Before the funding of a pooled trust, all liens and claims in favor of the Department of Public Welfare for repayment of cash and medical assistance shall first be satisfied. All money received for pooled trust funds shall be deposited with a court-approved corporate fiduciary or with the State Treasury if no court-approved corporate fiduciary is available to the trustee. The funds shall be pooled for investment and management. A separate account shall be maintained for each beneficiary, and quarterly accounting statements shall be provided to each beneficiary by the trustee. The court-approved corporate fiduciary or the State Treasury shall provide quarterly accounting statements to the trustee. The court-approved corporate fiduciary or the State Treasury may charge a trust management fee to cover the costs of managing the funds in the pooled trust. (d) Reporting.-- (1) In addition to reports required to be filed under 15 Pa.C.S. Pt. III (relating to partnerships and limited liability companies), the trustee shall file an annual report with the Office of Attorney General and the Department of Public Welfare, along with an itemized statement which shows the funds collected for the year, income earned, salaries paid, other expenses incurred and the opening and final trust balances. A copy of this statement shall be available to the beneficiary, settlor or designee of the settlor upon request. (2) The trustee shall prepare and provide each settlor or the settlor's designee annually with a detailed individual statement of the services provided to the settlor's beneficiary during the previous 12 months and of the services to be provided during the following 12 months. The trustee shall provide a copy of this statement to the beneficiary upon request. (e) Coordination of services.-- (1) The Department of Public Welfare shall review and approve the pooled trust of an applicant for medical assistance.

(a) General rule.-- No bonds or notes shall be issued with a stated maturity date exceeding the sooner to occur of: (1) Forty years from the date of the series of any bonds or notes issued to evidence debt for the purpose of financing the cost of actually constructing, acquiring or improving a project or a separately financed portion of a project or funding an unfunded actuarial accrued liability. (2) (i) The useful life of the project being financed as stated in the ordinance of the local government unit enacted in connection with the series of bonds or notes to be issued for the project, which statement in the ordinance shall be conclusive for all purposes. If projects have been combined for financing pursuant to section 8101 (relating to combining projects for financing or series of bonds or notes for sale) and the projects have different useful lives, it is sufficient for this section if an aggregate principal amount of bonds or notes equal to the separate cost of each project having a shorter useful life have been stated to mature prior to the end of the useful life, and the balance prior to the end of the longest useful life. For the purpose of this paragraph, the inclusion of furnishings, machinery, apparatus or equipment for a construction or acquisition project shall not be deemed to be the combining of projects, but the useful life of the project shall be that of the building, structure or improvement constructed or acquired. (ii) Where capital budgeting is practiced and bonds are issued to fund the current portion of a capital budget involving projects of varying useful lives, a uniform term of 30 years may be used. (iii) Where the project being financed is a countywide revision of assessment of real property, the useful life shall be a term of no more than ten years. (iv) Where a project consists of the funding of all or a portion of a reserve, or a contribution toward a combined reserve, pool or other arrangement, relating to self-insurance, the useful life shall be the term specified in the ordinance of the local government unit, not to exceed 20 years, or, if none is specified, then the useful life shall be deemed to be 20 years. (b) Mandatory redemption and stated maturities or installments.-- Bonds or notes may be serial bonds or notes or term bonds or notes or any combination thereof that may be selected by the governing body of the issuing local government unit. Except for bonds or notes issued to fund an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, if term bonds or notes are issued, the bonds or notes shall be subject to mandatory redemption, and, if serial or installment bonds or notes, the amounts of the stated maturities or installments shall be fixed: (1) so as to amortize the issue on at least an approximately level annual debt service plan during the period specified for the payment of principal in subsection (c); or (2) so that the debt service on outstanding debt of the same classification, and for this purpose lease rental debt shall be considered as the same classification as general obligation debt, will be brought more nearly into an overall level annual debt service plan. (c) Deferral of stated installments or maturities or mandatory redemption.-- Except as provided by subsection (e), stated installments or maturities of principal of any series of bonds or notes or the mandatory redemption of the principal may not be deferred beyond the later of two years from date of issue or one year after estimated completion of construction. In the case of revenue or guaranteed revenue bonds, this provision will be satisfied by a covenant for the mandatory application to term bonds of such revenues as may remain after payment of interest and operating expenses up to a fixed amount conforming to subsection (b) as shall be specified in the ordinance pursuant to which the bonds or notes are issued. (d) Fixing earlier maturity dates.-- This section does not prevent the fixing of the amount of stated maturity dates so that a greater percentage of a series will mature on earlier dates than those allowable by this subpart. (e) Maturity dates for different series.-- This section does not prevent the authorization of bonds or notes of an issue for sale in one or more series, in which case the first stated maturity of a later series may be later than, but not more than 15 months later than, the last stated maturity of the next preceding series.",

      "text": "§ 8613. Manner of executing anatomical gifts. (a) Gifts by will.-- A gift of all or part of the body under section 8611(a) (relating to persons who may execute anatomical gift) may be made by will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the testator without waiting for probate. If the will is not probated or if it is declared invalid for testamentary purposes, the gift, to the extent that it has been acted upon in good faith, is nevertheless valid and effective. (b) Gifts by other documents.-- A gift of all or part of the body under section 8611(a) may also be made by document other than a will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the donor. The document, which may be a card designed to be carried on the person, must be signed by the donor in the presence of two witnesses who must sign the document in his presence. If the donor is mentally competent to signify his desire to sign the document but is physically unable to do so, the document may be signed for him by another at his direction and in his presence in the presence of two witnesses who must sign the document in his presence. Delivery of the document of gift during the donor's lifetime is not necessary to make the gift valid. (b.1) Other means.-- An anatomical gift may be made by a statement or symbol indicating that the donor has made an anatomical gift, which shall be recorded in a donor registry or on the donor's driver's license or identification card. If an anatomical gift is indicated on a driver's license or an identification card, the anatomical gift is not invalidated by revocation, suspension, expiration or cancellation of: (1) the driver's license under 75 Pa.C.S. Ch. 15 (relating to licensing of drivers); or (2) the identification card by the Department of Transportation. (c) Specified and unspecified donees.-- The gift may be made to a specified donee or without specifying a donee. If the latter, the gift may be accepted by the attending physician as donee upon or following death. If the gift is made to a specified donee who is not available at the time and place of death, the attending physician upon or following death, in the absence of any expressed indication that the donor desired otherwise, may accept the gift as donee. The physician who becomes a donee under this subsection shall not participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part. (d) Designation of person to carry out procedures.-- (Deleted by amendment). (d.1) Reliance.-- Subject to the provisions of section 8616(c) (relating to rights and duties at death), a person may rely on a document of gift or amendment to a document of gift as being valid unless that person knows that the document of gift was not validly executed or was revoked. (e) Consent not necessary.-- (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a donor's gift of all or any part of the donor's body, including a designation in a registry on a driver's license or identification card, donor card, advance health care directive, will or other document of gift, may not be revoked by the next of kin or other persons identified in section 8611(b). The consent of any person at the time of the donor's death or immediately thereafter is not necessary to render the gift valid and effective. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit the donation of a vascularized composite allograft. (2) An agent, only if expressly authorized in writing in a power of attorney, advance health care directive, health care power of attorney or other document to override the decedent's instructions on the making of an anatomical gift, may revoke the decedent's gift. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit the donation of a vascularized composite allograft. (f) Documentation of gifts by others.-- Any gift by a person designated in section 8611(b) shall be made by a document signed by him or made by his telegraphic, recorded telephonic or other recorded message. (g) Validity.-- A document of gift is valid if executed in accordance with: (1) this subchapter; (2) the law of the state or country where it was executed; or (3) the law of the state or country where, at the time of execution of the document of gift, the person making the anatomical gift: (i) is domiciled; (ii) has a place of residence; or (iii) is a citizen. (h) Choice of law.-- If a document of gift is valid under this section, the law of this Commonwealth governs interpretation of the document. (i) Rights and protections for certain individuals.-- (1) An individual who is in need of an anatomical gift shall not be deemed ineligible to receive an anatomical gift solely because of the individual's physical or mental disability, except to the extent that the physical or mental disability has been found by a physician or surgeon following an individualized evaluation of the individual to be medically significant to the provision of the anatomical gift. If an individual has the necessary support system to assist the individual in complying with posttransplant medical requirements, an individual's inability to independently comply with those requirements shall not be deemed to be medically significant. (2) As used in this subsection, \"disability\" shall have the same meaning as in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327). (Oct. 23, 2018, P.L.594, No.90) 2018 Amendment. Act 90 amended subsec. (e), added subsecs. (b.1), (d.1), (g), (h) and (i) and deleted subsec. (d).

If the gift is of a part of the body, the donee, upon the death of the donor and prior to embalming, shall cause the part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation. After removal of the part, custody of the remainder of the body vests in the surviving spouse, next of kin or other persons under obligation to dispose of the body. (b) Physicians.-- The time of death shall be determined by a physician who tends the donor at his death or, if none, the physician who certifies the death. (c) Certain liability limited.-- The following shall apply: (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a person who acts in good faith in accordance with the terms of this subchapter or with the anatomical gift laws of another state or a foreign country shall not be liable for damages in any civil action or subject to prosecution in any criminal proceeding for the person's act. (2) The immunity from civil liability provided under paragraph (1) shall not extend to acts or omissions resulting from gross negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct of the person.

(a) Procedure.-- A hospital located in this Commonwealth shall notify the applicable designated organ procurement organization or a third party designated by the organ procurement organization of an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in the hospital. Notification shall be made in a timely manner to ensure that examination, evaluation and ascertainment of donor status as specified in subsection (d) may be completed within a time frame compatible with the donation of organs and tissues for transplant. The notification shall be made without regard to whether the person has executed an advance health care directive. (b) Referrals.-- If an organ procurement organization receives a referral of an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital, the organ procurement organization shall make a reasonable search of the records of the Donate Life PA Registry or the applicable State donor registry that the organ procurement organization knows exists for the geographic area in which the individual resided or resides in order to ascertain whether the individual has made an anatomical gift. (c) Document of gift.-- (1) If the individual whose death is imminent or has died in the hospital has a document of gift which authorizes an anatomical donation, including registration with the Donate Life PA Registry, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall attempt to notify a person listed in section 8611(b) (relating to persons who may execute anatomical gift) of the gift. (2) If no document of gift is known to the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor, then the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall ask the persons listed in section 8611(b) whether the individual had a validly executed document of gift. If there is no evidence of an anatomical gift by the individual, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall notify a person listed in section 8611(b) of the option to donate organs and tissues. The notification shall be performed in accordance with a protocol that encourages discretion and sensitivity to family circumstances in all discussions regarding donations of organs and tissues. The protocol shall take into account the individual's religious beliefs or nonsuitability for organ and tissue donation. (3) The hospital administrator or the hospital administrator's designated representative shall indicate in the medical record of the individual the information under this paragraph.

(C) Whether the individual amended or revoked an anatomical gift in any document specified in this subparagraph or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615 (relating to amendment or revocation of gift). (d) Testing.-- (1) This subsection shall apply if: (i) a hospital refers an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital to an organ procurement organization; (ii) the organ procurement organization, in consultation with the individual's attending physician or a designee, determines, based upon a medical record review and other information supplied by the individual's attending physician or a designee, that the individual may be a prospective donor; and (iii) the individual has not: (A) indicated in an advance health care directive, a living will, power of attorney, health care power of attorney, will, DNR order or other document an intention to either limit the anatomical gifts of the individual to parts of the body which do not require a ventilator or other life-sustaining measures or indicated an intention to deny making or refusing to make an anatomical gift; or (B) amended or revoked an anatomical gift in any document specified in subsection (c)(3) or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615. (2) If the requirements of paragraph (1) are met, the following shall apply: (i) Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (c)(3), the organ procurement organization may conduct a blood or tissue test or minimally invasive examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of a part that is or may be the subject of an anatomical gift. Testing and examination under this subparagraph shall comply with a denial or refusal to make an anatomical gift or any limitation expressed by the individual with respect to the part of the body to donate or a limitation in the provision of a ventilator or other life-sustaining measures, as specified in subsection (c)(3) or a revocation or amendment to an anatomical gift as specified in a document in subsection (c)(3) or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615. The results of tests and examinations under this subparagraph shall be used or disclosed only: (A) to evaluate medical suitability for donation and to facilitate the donation process; and (B) as required or permitted by law. (ii) Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (c)(3), the hospital may not withdraw any measures which are necessary to maintain the medical suitability of the part until the organ procurement organization or designated requestor, as appropriate, has had the opportunity to advise the applicable persons as set forth in section 8611(b) of the option to make an anatomical gift and has received or been denied authorization to proceed with recovery of the part. (3) (Deleted by amendment). (4) (Deleted by amendment). (e) Testing after death.-- Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (c)(3), after an individual's death, a person to whom an anatomical gift may pass under section 8612 (relating to persons who may become donees; purposes for which anatomical gifts may be made) may conduct a test or examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose.

The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part. (2) Subject to the wishes of the individual under subsection (c)(3) and this subchapter, a person that accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial or cremation and the use of remains in a funeral service. If the gift is of a part, the person to whom the part passes under section 8612, upon the death of the individual and before embalming, burial or cremation, shall cause the part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation. (f.3) Physicians.-- (1) Neither the physician who attends the individual at death nor the physician who determines the time of the individual's death may participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part from the individual.

(g) Death record review.-- (1) The Department of Health shall make annual death record reviews at acute care general hospitals to determine their compliance with subsection (a). (2) To conduct a review of an acute care general hospital, the following apply: (i) The department shall select to carry out the review the Commonwealth-licensed organ procurement organization designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the region within which the acute care general hospital is located.

(ii) If there is no valid selection under subparagraph (i) or if the organization selected under subparagraph (i) is unwilling to carry out the review, the department shall select to carry out the review any other Commonwealth-licensed organ procurement organization. For an organ procurement organization to be selected under this subparagraph, the organization must not operate nor have an ownership interest in an entity which provides all of the functions of a tissue procurement provider. (iii) If there is no valid selection under subparagraph (ii) or if the organization selected under subparagraph (ii) is unwilling to carry out the review, the department shall carry out the review using trained department personnel. (3) There shall be no cost assessed against a hospital for a review under this subsection. (4) If the department finds, on the basis of a review under this subsection, that a hospital is not in compliance with subsection (a), the department may impose an administrative fine of up to $500 for each instance of noncompliance.

The following apply: (1) An individual of sound mind who is 18 years of age or older may authorize recovery of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts. The authorization may be in a will, living will, health care power of attorney, power of attorney or other document. In order to be valid, the authorization must be in writing, witnessed by two other individuals and explicitly and specifically state that the individual authorizes the recovery of the individual's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts. The authorization must be provided separately from an anatomical donation. If the individual explicitly, specifically and separately authorizes such a gift and requests reconstructive surgery, then the surgery shall be provided at no cost to the individual or the individual's family or representative. Any limitations on the provision of the gift authorized by the individual shall be honored by the hospital, a donee under section 8662 (relating to donees and vascularized composite allografts), health care professionals involved in the recovery and transplantation process, the organ procurement organizations and any other person involved with the donation and recovery of a vascularized composite allograft. If the individual authorizes a gift of hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts, then authorization of a surrogate decision maker shall not be necessary. (2) It is unlawful for a minor to authorize the donation of the minor's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts. In the case of a minor whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital, a parent or guardian may authorize donation of the minor's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts if the parent or guardian does not have actual notice of contrary indications on the part of the minor with respect to making a donation of the minor's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts and there is no actual notice of opposition by the other parent. If the parent or guardian has actual notice of contrary indications or there is actual notice of opposition by the other parent, then the parent or guardian is not authorized to make such a gift. The hospital, health care professionals, organ procurement organization and a donee under section 8662 shall not effectuate a donation if the minor evidenced contrary indications regarding donation of the minor's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts or there is actual notice of opposition by the other parent. (3) A gift of a vascularized composite allograft under this section may be revoked or amended at any time and in the manner specified in section 8615 (relating to amendment or revocation of gift).

The following applies to organ procurement organizations, health care professionals, donees under section 8662 (relating to donees and vascularized composite allografts) and other persons who request a gift of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts from a surrogate decision maker: (1) The request for a donation must be made separately from a request for donation under Subchapter B (relating to express anatomical gifts). The request must explicitly and specifically identify donations of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts as distinct from traditional organs such as heart, liver, or lung or tissues under Subchapter B. The discussion must educate the surrogate decision maker about the process of recovery of vascularized composite allografts and must clearly define and explain all of the following: (i) What a vascularized composite allograft is, the benefit to the recipient and precisely what will be recovered. (ii) That any prior generalized authorization for an anatomical gift under Subchapter B does not include a gift of a hand, facial tissue, limb or other vascularized composite allograft. (iii) That permission for a gift of a hand, facial tissue, limb or other vascularized composite allograft must be given separately from the permission for a gift under Subchapter B. (iv) That the appearance of the individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital will be significantly altered after the recovery of the gift and that upon request the recovery team will perform reconstructive surgery on the individual at no cost to the individual, the individual's family or surrogate decision maker. In addition, the discussion must explain that the recovery of vascularized composite allografts may impact burial arrangements and that an open casket may not be possible. (v) That the identity of the individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital may not be able to be protected due to fingerprints or birthmarks. (2) A deceased donor authorization form shall be used which specifically identifies the option of authorizing a gift of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts. The form must include a provision which states that the surrogate decision maker and family of the individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital understands the relevant anatomical details of the donation, the alteration of the appearance of the individual, including the impact of the recovery of vascularized composite allografts upon funeral arrangements, and that, despite the best efforts of the organ procurement organization, the anonymity of the individual may not be protected. Further, the form must provide information about the nature of the discussion required under paragraph (1), including: (i) the date and time of the discussion; (ii) for individuals who hold a professional or occupational license, the names, addresses, telephone numbers and professional or occupational license numbers of the individuals who made the request for the donation and provided the information under paragraph (1); and (iii) a summary of the topics discussed and which surrogate decision maker authorized the gift of a vascularized composite allograft.

(a) Gift.-- The following apply to vascularized composite allografts: (1) If the individual whose death is imminent or has died in the hospital has a document of gift which authorizes a gift of a vascularized composite allograft, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall attempt to notify a surrogate decision maker. (2) If no document of gift is known to the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor, then the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor may ask the surrogate decision maker whether the individual had a validly executed document of gift. If there is no evidence of gift of a vascularized composite allograft by the individual, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall notify the surrogate decision maker of the option to donate a vascularized composite allograft. The notification shall be performed in accordance with section 8656 (relating to procedure for requesting hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts). (3) The hospital administrator or the hospital administrator's designated representative shall indicate in the medical record of the individual the information under this paragraph and paragraph (2).

The results of tests and examinations under this subparagraph shall be used or disclosed only: (A) to evaluate medical suitability for donation of a vascularized composite allograft and to facilitate the donation process; and (B) as required or permitted by law. (ii) Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (a)(3), the hospital may not withdraw any measures which are necessary to maintain the medical suitability of the vascularized composite allograft until the organ procurement organization or designated requestor, as appropriate, has had the opportunity to advise the surrogate decision maker of the option to make a gift of a vascularized composite allograft and has received or been denied authorization to proceed with recovery of the vascularized composite allograft. (c) Testing after death.-- Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (a)(3), after an individual's death, a person to whom an anatomical gift may pass under section 8662 (relating to donees and vascularized composite allografts) may conduct a test or examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of the vascularized composite allograft for its intended purpose. (d) Recipients.-- Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (a)(3) and as set forth in this subchapter, a person that accepts a gift of a vascularized composite allograft may allow embalming, burial or cremation and the use of remains in a funeral service.

(b) Recovery of deferred costs.-- (1) In a restructuring proceeding, the natural gas distribution company may identify categories of costs resulting from this chapter. (2) The natural gas distribution company may seek permission in its restructuring proceeding to capitalize and to amortize such costs over an appropriate period to be determined by the commission. The amortization shall commence at the time when restructuring orders are issued. The natural gas distribution company may seek recovery of the unamortized balance of such costs in a future rate proceeding, and the commission shall allow recovery of such costs provided that the commission determines that such costs are reasonable and that the resulting rates are just and reasonable. (c) Deferral of costs.-- Costs recoverable under sections 2203(6) (relating to standards for restructuring of natural gas utility industry) and 2206(e) (relating to consumer protections and customer service) in excess of amounts already reflected in a natural gas distribution company's rates, which are incurred between the date of entry of the commission's restructuring order and the earlier of the date on which the commission authorizes commencement of recovery or June 30, 2002, may be deferred for recovery in the future. Such deferrals shall be without interest. (d) Circumstances for exceptions.-- A natural gas distribution company may seek and the commission may approve an exception to the limitations set forth in this section under any of the following circumstances: (1) The natural gas distribution company meets the requirements for extraordinary relief under section 1308(e) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). (2) The natural gas distribution company demonstrates that a rate increase is necessary in order to preserve the reliability of the natural gas distribution system. (3) The natural gas distribution company is subject to significant increases in the rate of Federal taxes or other significant increases in costs resulting from changes in law or regulations that would not allow the natural gas distribution company to earn a fair rate of return. (e) Interclass and intraclass cost shifts.-- Except as provided in section 2212, for the period from the effective date of this chapter until January 1, 2001, interclass or intraclass cost shifts are prohibited. This prohibition against cost shifting may be accomplished by maintaining the cost allocation methodology accepted by the commission for each natural gas distribution company in the company's most recent base rate proceeding. (f) State tax adjustment surcharge.-- The natural gas distribution company, other than a city natural gas distribution operation, shall remain subject to the State tax adjustment surcharge and shall be permitted to adjust its State tax adjustment surcharge mechanism to reflect State tax changes or additions. The natural gas distribution company shall also remain subject to existing riders or surcharges for the collection of nongas transition costs pursuant to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decisions. (g) Provisions relating to interstate pipelines.-- (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if a natural gas distribution company's current base rate revenues reflect the margins realized through the utilization of firm interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to serve the interruptible market when such capacity is not needed to make firm retail deliveries, then the natural gas distribution company shall be permitted to increase base rates and, at the same time, reduce purchased gas cost rates, as described in this chapter. (2) The natural gas distribution company may propose such a change in treatment, consistent with the following requirements: (i) Base rates of customers who pay purchased gas cost rates pursuant to section 1307(f) (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) shall be increased by an amount equal to the margin received for service provided to existing interruptible sales and transportation service customers using capacity reflected in rates established under section 1307(f) based upon the revenue for such services for the most recent 12-month period immediately preceding the application. (ii) Purchased gas cost rates established pursuant to section 1307(f) shall be decreased by an amount equal to the amount by which base rates are increased in subparagraph (i). (iii) Purchased gas cost rates established pursuant to section 1307(f) shall thereafter be reconciled to reflect the margins realized from interruptible sales and interruptible transportation customers utilizing capacity reflected in rates established under section 1307(f). (h) Interstate pipeline transportation.-- (1) Except as specifically set forth in this subsection, nothing in this section or section 2204(d) (relating to implementation) shall prevent a natural gas distribution company from recovering costs paid under the terms of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts which are not fully recovered through a release, assignment or transfer of such capacity to another natural gas supplier if such unrecovered costs arise under the terms of a natural gas transportation pilot program approved by the commission for such company on or before February 1, 1999. (2) Such unrecovered interstate pipeline transportation and capacity costs incurred under such programs through October 31, 2004, may be recovered from a class or classes of customers in accordance with such program provided that the total volumetric charge for such costs does not exceed 1% of the volumetric charge for residential natural gas sales service set forth in the natural gas distribution company's tariff in effect at the time. (3) With respect to such pilot programs, the commission may determine to extend such programs to include all customers of that company pursuant to the requirements of this chapter, and nothing in this section or section 2204(d) shall prevent unrecovered interstate pipeline and transportation capacity costs incurred through October 31, 2004, under such programs from being recovered in accordance with such programs provided that the total volumetric charge for such costs does not exceed the 1% limit specified in paragraph (2) for pilot programs.",

A vehicle which is unlawfully parked in a designated person with a disability parking area may be removed from that area by towing and may be reclaimed by the vehicle owner upon payment of the towing costs. A vehicle may only be towed under this paragraph if the parking space is posted with a sign indicating that vehicles in violation of this section may be towed. (ii) Local authorities shall have the power and may, by ordinance or resolution, authorize a person with a disability and severely disabled veterans to issue statements to violators or violating vehicles for violation of subparagraph (i).

(e) Unauthorized use.-- An operator of a vehicle bearing a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran plate or displaying a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran parking placard shall not make use of the parking privileges accorded to a person with a disability and severely disabled veterans under subsection (d)(3) unless the operator is a person with a disability or a severely disabled veteran or unless the vehicle is being operated for the transportation of a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran. (e.1) Motorcycle parking.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6301 (relating to prosecutions under local ordinances superseded by title) regarding parking violations, a local ordinance may not prohibit nor cite as a violation the parallel or angle occupancy by one or more motorcycles in any parking space on any highway otherwise available for parking for other individual vehicles, provided that the space occupied by one or more motorcycles does not exceed the space within which a single vehicle must park. In the instance of a violation applicable to any single vehicle, each motorcycle so parked shall be individually liable for any violation as if the motorcycle were the sole occupant of the parking space. (f) Penalty.-- A person violating subsection (a), (b) or (d)(1) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $15.

If a person is convicted under subsection (d)(2) or (3) in the absence of a sign stating the penalty amount, the fine imposed may not exceed $50. A person violating subsection (d.1) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $300.

(a) General rule.-- The association has a lien on a unit for any assessment levied against that unit or fines imposed against its unit owner from the time the assessment or fine becomes due. The association's lien may be foreclosed in a like manner as a mortgage on real estate. A judicial or other sale of the unit in execution of a common element lien or any other lien shall not affect the lien of a mortgage on the unit, except the mortgage for which the sale is being held, if the mortgage is prior to all other liens upon the same property except those liens identified in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8152(a) (relating to judicial sale as affecting lien of mortgage) and liens for planned community assessments created under this section. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines and interest charged under section 5302(a)(10), (11) and (12) (relating to power of unit owners' association) and reasonable costs and expenses of the association, including legal fees, incurred in connection with collection of any sums due to the association by the unit owner or enforcement of the provisions of the declaration, bylaws, rules or regulations against the unit owner are enforceable as assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in installments and one or more installments are not paid when due, the entire outstanding balance of the assessment becomes effective as a lien from the due date of the delinquent installment. (b) Priority of lien.-- (1) General rule.-- A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except: (i) Liens and encumbrances recorded before the recording of the declaration. (ii) (A) Mortgages and deeds of trust on the unit securing first mortgage holders and recorded before due date of the assessment if the assessment is not payable in installments or the due date of the unpaid installment if the assessment is payable in installments. (B) Judgments obtained for obligations secured by any such mortgage or deed of trust under clause (A). (iii) Liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit. (2) Limited nondivestiture.-- The association's lien for assessments shall be divested by a judicial sale of the unit: (i) As to unpaid common expense assessments made under section 5314(b) (relating to assessments for common expenses) that come due during the six months immediately preceding the date of a judicial sale of a unit in an action to enforce collection of a lien against a unit by a judicial sale, only to the extent that the six months' unpaid assessments are paid out of the proceeds of the sale. (ii) As to unpaid common expense assessments made under section 5314(b) other than the six months' assessment referred to in subparagraph (i), in a full amount of the unpaid assessments, whether or not the proceeds of the judicial sale are adequate to pay these assessments. To the extent that the proceeds of the sale are sufficient to pay some or all of these additional assessments after satisfaction in full of the costs of the judicial sale and the liens and encumbrances of the types described in paragraph (1) and the unpaid common expense assessments that come due during the six-month period described in subparagraph (i), the assessments shall be paid before any remaining proceeds may be paid to any other claimant, including the prior owner of the unit. (3) Monetary exemption.-- The lien is not subject to the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8123 (relating to general monetary exemption). (c) Liens having equal priority.-- If the association and one or more associations, condominium associations or cooperative associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same real estate, those liens have equal priority. (d) Notice and perfection of lien.-- Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. (e) Limitation of actions.-- A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien or actions or suits to recover sums for which subsection (a) establishes a lien are instituted within four years after the assessments become payable. (f) Other remedies preserved.-- Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit actions or suits to recover sums for which subsection (a) creates a lien or to prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure. (g) Costs and attorney fees.-- A judgment or decree in any action or suit brought under this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney fees for the prevailing party. (h) Statement of unpaid assessments.-- The association shall furnish to a unit owner upon written request a recordable statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments currently levied against his unit and any credits of surplus in favor of his unit under section 5313 (relating to surplus funds). The statement shall be furnished within ten business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive board and every unit owner. (i) Application of payments.-- Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any payment received by an association in connection with the lien under this section shall be applied first to any interest accrued by the association, then to any late fee, then to any costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the association in collection or enforcement and then to the delinquent assessment. The foregoing shall be applicable notwithstanding any restrictive endorsement, designation or instructions placed on or accompanying a payment.

(2) Complying with a direction or decision of an individual who the health care provider believes in good faith has authority to act as a principal's health care agent or health care representative so long as the direction or decision is not clearly contrary to the terms of an advance health care directive that has been delivered to the provider. (3) Refusing to comply with a direction or decision of an individual based on a good faith belief that the individual lacks authority to act as a principal's health care agent or health care representative or is not acting in accordance with section 5456(c) (relating to authority of health care agent) or 5461(c) (relating to decisions by health care representative). (4) Complying with an advance health care directive under the assumption that it was valid when made and the health care provider believes in good faith that it has not been amended or revoked. (5) Disclosing health care information to another person based upon a good faith belief that the disclosure is authorized, permitted or required by this chapter. (6) Refusing to comply with a direction or decision of an individual based on a good faith belief that compliance with the direction or decision would be unethical or, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, would result in medical care having no medical basis in addressing any medical need or condition of the individual, provided that the health care provider complies in good faith with sections 5424 (relating to compliance) and 5462(c) (relating to duties of attending physician and health care provider). (b) Same effect as if dealing with principal.-- Any health care provider and other person acting under subsection (a) is protected and released to the same extent as if dealing directly with a competent principal.

(a) General rule.-- A health care representative may make a health care decision for an individual whose attending physician has determined that the individual is incompetent if: (1) the individual is at least 18 years of age, has graduated from high school, has married or is an emancipated minor; (2) (i) the individual does not have a health care power of attorney; or (ii) the individual's health care agent is not reasonably available or has indicated an unwillingness to act and no alternate health care agent is reasonably available; and (3) a guardian of the person to make health care decisions has not been appointed for the individual. (b) Application.-- This section applies to decisions regarding treatment, care, goods or services that a caretaker is obligated to provide to a care-dependent person who has an end-stage medical condition or is permanently unconscious as permitted under 18 Pa.C.S. § 2713(e)(5) (relating to neglect of care-dependent person). (c) Extent of authority of health care representative.-- Except as set forth in section 5462(c)(1) (relating to duties of attending physician and health care provider), the authority and the decision-making process of a health care representative shall be the same as provided for a health care agent in section 5456 (relating to authority of health care agent) and 5460(c) (relating to relation of health care agent to court-appointed guardian and other agents). (d) Who may act as health care representative.-- (1) An individual of sound mind may, by a signed writing or by personally informing the attending physician or the health care provider, designate one or more individuals to act as health care representative. In the absence of a designation or if no designee is reasonably available, any member of the following classes, in descending order of priority, who is reasonably available may act as health care representative: (i) The spouse, unless an action for divorce is pending, and the adult children of the principal who are not the children of the spouse. (ii) An adult child. (iii) A parent. (iv) An adult brother or sister. (v) An adult grandchild. (vi) An adult who has knowledge of the principal's preferences and values, including, but not limited to, religious and moral beliefs, to assess how the principal would make health care decisions. (2) An individual may by signed writing, including a health care power of attorney, provide for a different order of priority. (3) An individual with a higher priority who is willing to act as a health care representative may assume the authority to act notwithstanding the fact that another individual has previously assumed that authority. (e) Disqualification.-- An individual of sound mind may disqualify one or more individuals from acting as health care representative in the same manner as specified under subsection (d) for the designation of a health care representative. An individual may also disqualify one or more individuals from acting as health care representative by a health care power of attorney. Upon the petition of any member of the classes set forth in subsection (d), the court may disqualify for cause shown an individual otherwise eligible to serve as a health care representative. (f) Limitation on designation of health care representative.-- Unless related by blood, marriage or adoption, a health care representative may not be the principal's attending physician or other health care provider nor an owner, operator or employee of a health care provider in which the principal receives care. (g) Decision of health care representative.-- (1) If more than one member of a class assumes authority to act as a health care representative, the members do not agree on a health care decision and the attending physician or health care provider is so informed, the attending physician or health care provider may rely on the decision of a majority of the members of that class who have communicated their views to the attending physician or health care provider. (2) If the members of the class of health care representatives are evenly divided concerning the health care decision and the attending physician or health care provider is so informed, an individual having a lower priority may not act as a health care representative. So long as the class remains evenly divided, no decision shall be deemed made until such time as the parties resolve their disagreement. Notwithstanding such disagreement, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude the administration of health care treatment in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice. (h) Duty of health care representative.-- Promptly upon assuming authority to act, a health care representative shall communicate the assumption of authority to the members of the principal's family specified in subsection (d) who can be readily contacted. (i) Countermand of health care decision.-- (1) A principal of sound mind may countermand any health care decision made by the principal's health care representative at any time and in any manner by personally informing the attending physician or health care provider. (2) Regardless of the principal's mental or physical capacity, a principal may countermand a health care decision made by the principal's health care representative that would withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment at any time and in any manner by personally informing the attending physician. (3) The attending physician or health care provider shall make reasonable efforts to promptly inform the health care representative of a countermand exercised under this section. (4) A countermand exercised under this section shall not affect the authority of the health care representative to make other health care decisions. (j) Court approval unnecessary.-- A health care decision made by a health care representative for a principal shall be effective without court approval. (k) Written declaration of health care representative.-- An attending physician or health care provider may require a person claiming the right to act as health care representative for a principal to provide a written declaration made under penalty of perjury stating facts and circumstances reasonably sufficient to establish the claimed authority.

(a) Automatic review.-- If the evidence presented during the guardianship proceeding indicates that the circumstances of the person's incapacity may change, the court shall hold a review hearing to determine whether the guardianship continues to be necessary. The court shall set the date for a review hearing under this subsection in the court's order establishing guardianship. The review hearing under this subsection shall be held no later than one year from the date of the order establishing the guardianship. The hearing shall be conducted in the presence of the incapacitated person and the person's attorney, and the court shall adhere to the procedures and standards as outlined in section 5512.1(a) (relating to determination of incapacity and appointment of guardian). If, following the presentation of evidence and testimony from all parties, the court finds that guardianship continues to be necessary and that no less restrictive alternatives exist, the court may order that the guardianship continue. If the court finds that guardianship is no longer necessary or a less restrictive alternative exists, the court shall discharge the guardianship. In determining whether the circumstances of the person's incapacity may change, the court may consider any of the following: (1) whether the incapacity could be adequately managed by medication, rehabilitation or other means; (2) whether the potential exists for the incapacitated person to regain physical or cognitive capacity; (3) the opinion of a medical professional or other qualified expert who has personally examined the incapacitated person; (4) the circumstances of the incapacitated person's daily living, including, but not limited to, support from others; and (5) any other factor indicating that the incapacitated person's condition could improve at a future time. (a.1) Petition for review.-- At any time following the issuance of the order establishing guardianship, any interested person may file a petition with the court to terminate or modify the guardianship. The court shall promptly schedule a hearing or hold a review hearing at any time it shall direct. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the incapacitated person and the incapacitated person's attorney, and the court shall adhere to the procedures and standards as outlined in section 5512.1(a). If, following the presentation of evidence and testimony from all parties, the court finds that guardianship continues to be necessary and that no less restrictive alternatives exist, the court may order that the guardianship continue. If the court finds that guardianship is no longer necessary or a less restrictive alternative exists, the court shall discharge the guardianship.

(2) Act in good faith. (3) Act only within the scope of authority granted in the power of attorney. (b) Other duties.-- Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent that has accepted appointment shall: (1) Act loyally for the principal's benefit. (1.1) Keep the agent's funds separate from the principal's funds unless: (i) the funds were not kept separate as of the date of the execution of the power of attorney; or (ii) the principal commingles the funds after the date of the execution of the power of attorney and the agent is the principal's spouse. (2) Act so as not to create a conflict of interest that impairs the agent's ability to act impartially in the principal's best interest. (3) Act with the care, competence and diligence ordinarily exercised by agents in similar circumstances. (4) Keep a record of all receipts, disbursements and transactions made on behalf of the principal. (5) Cooperate with a person who has authority to make health care decisions for the principal to carry out the principal's reasonable expectations to the extent actually known by the agent and, otherwise, act in the principal's best interest. (6) Attempt to preserve the principal's estate plan, to the extent actually known by the agent, if preserving the plan is consistent with the principal's best interest based on all relevant factors, including: (i) The value and nature of the principal's property. (ii) The principal's foreseeable obligations and need for maintenance. (iii) Minimization of taxes, including income, estate, inheritance, generation-skipping transfer and gift taxes. (iv) Eligibility for a benefit, program or assistance under a statute or regulation. (c) Nonliability of agent.-- (1) An agent that acts in good faith shall not be liable to a beneficiary of the principal's estate plan for failure to preserve the plan. (2) An agent that acts with care, competence and diligence for the best interest of the principal shall not be liable solely because the agent also benefits from the act or has an individual or conflicting interest in relation to the property or affairs of the principal. (3) If an agent is selected by the principal because of special skills or expertise possessed by the agent or in reliance on the agent's representation that the agent has special skills or expertise, the special skills or expertise must be considered in determining whether the agent has acted with care, competence and diligence under the circumstances. (4) Absent a breach of duty to the principal, an agent shall not be liable if the value of the principal's property declines. (5) An agent that exercises authority to delegate to another person the authority granted by the principal or that engages another person on behalf of the principal shall not be liable for an act, error of judgment or default of that person if the agent exercises care, competence and diligence in selecting and monitoring the person. (d) Disclosure of receipts, disbursements or transactions.-- (1) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent shall not be required to disclose receipts, disbursements or transactions conducted on behalf of the principal unless ordered by a court or requested by the principal, a guardian, conservator, another fiduciary acting for the principal, governmental agency having authority to protect the welfare of the principal or, upon the death of the principal, the personal representative or successor in interest of the principal's estate. (2) Within 30 days of the request, the agent shall either comply with the request or provide a writing or other record substantiating the reason additional time is needed, in which case the agent shall comply with the request within an additional 30 days.

(d) Administrative termination of small charitable trusts.-- A trust solely for charitable purposes having assets of less than $100,000 may be terminated at its inception or at any time thereafter by the trustee with the consent of the Attorney General and all charitable organizations that are designated as beneficiaries by name in the trust instrument.

Whether or not the terms of a trust contain a spendthrift provision and notwithstanding section 7744 (relating to discretionary trusts; effect of standard - UTC 504): (1) During the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors. (2) A judgment creditor or assignee of the settlor of an irrevocable trust may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor's benefit. If a trust has more than one settlor, the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution.

In any such action all penalties incurred up to the time of commencing the action may be sued for and recovered therein and the commencement of an action to recover any such penalty shall not be, or be held to be, a waiver of the right to recover any other penalty. In case of recovery of any amount in an action brought to recover any such penalty the Commonwealth shall be entitled to recover full costs and at the rates provided for civil actions. (b) Duty and liability of witnesses.-- No person shall be excused from testifying or producing any books, papers or other documents in any civil action to recover any such penalty, upon the ground that his testimony might tend to convict him of an offense or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture. No person shall be prosecuted, punished or subjected to any penalty of forfeiture for or on account of any such act, transaction, matter or thing concerning which he shall, under oath, have testified or produced documentary evidence and no testimony so given or produced shall be received against him upon any criminal investigation or proceeding. No person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by him in his testimony. This subsection is not intended to give, and shall not be construed as in any manner giving, unto any corporation immunity of any kind. (c) Plea of guilty.-- A defendant charged with a violation of any provision of this chapter may himself plead guilty to the charge in open court. He may also submit to the judge having jurisdiction, in person, by duly authorized agent, or by registered mail, a statement setting forth the following: (1) That he waives arraignment in open court and the aid of counsel. (2) That he pleads guilty to the offense as charged. (3) That he elects and requests that the charge be disposed of and the fine or penalty fixed by the court. (4) Any explanation that he desires to make concerning the offense charged. (5) That he makes all statements under penalty of perjury. Thereupon the judge may proceed as though the defendant had been convicted upon a plea of guilty in open court. Any imposition of fine or penalty under this section shall be deemed tentative until the fine or penalty has been paid and discharged in full. If, upon receipt of the aforesaid statement, the judge shall deny the same, he shall thereupon notify the defendant of this fact and that he is required to appear before the said judge at a stated time and place to answer the charge which shall thereafter be disposed of pursuant to the applicable provisions of law. (d) Statement of disposition of case.-- Subject to any inconsistent procedures and standards relating to reports and transmission of funds prescribed pursuant to Title 42 (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure), the court before whom any person shall be tried shall, at the termination of the trial or proceeding, forthwith mail or deliver to the department at Harrisburg a certified statement of the disposition of the case or proceeding giving the date thereof, the name of the defendant, the date and place of the violation, the name of each witness sworn in support of the charges and the amount of the fine or penalty paid. (e) Section not exclusive.-- This section: (1) Does not prohibit the prosecution of violations of this chapter in any court of competent jurisdiction in the same manner as other offenses.

This subsection shall not expose to creditors' claims trust assets for which other provisions of substantive law provide exemption from the claims of the settlor's creditors. (b) Enforcement of claim against revocable trust.-- A creditor may make a claim against a revocable trust by notifying the settlor's personal representative as provided in section 3384 (relating to notice of claim) or, if no personal representative has been appointed, by notifying the trustee according to the methods set forth in section 3384. A personal representative who receives notice shall within 20 days notify the trustee in writing and upon doing so shall have no liability under this section to the creditor. (c) Trustee's duty to advertise.-- (1) A trustee of a revocable trust: (i) May advertise at any time after the settlor's death. (ii) Shall advertise if the first advertisement of the grant of letters by the settlor's personal representative does not occur within 90 days after the settlor's death. (2) Advertisements by the trustee under this subsection shall be in the manner set forth in section 3162 (relating to advertisement of grant of letters), shall be done in the jurisdiction of the deceased settlor's domicile and shall include: (i) The fact of the trust's existence. (ii) The trustee's name and address. (3) The personal representative of the settlor of a revocable trust shall send to the trustee copies of the proof of publication of the advertisement of the grant of letters. (d) Liability of personal representative.-- A personal representative who has received the notice required by section 7780.3(c) (relating to duty to inform and report) and does not notify the trustee of a revocable trust of a creditor's claim known to the personal representative within one year after the first complete advertisement of the grant of letters to the personal representative shall be liable to the creditor to the extent the creditor's interest is prejudiced thereby. A personal representative shall have no liability under this section to a creditor whose claim is not known to the personal representative within one year after the first complete advertisement of the grant of letters to the personal representative. The provisions of this section shall not affect the liability of the settlor's personal representative under other provisions of law. (e) Liability to any creditor.-- At the trustee's own risk and without the filing, audit or confirmation of the trustee's account, a trustee of a revocable trust who has either given the settlor's personal representative the notice required by section 7780.3(c) or given the notice required by subsection (c) may distribute real or personal property of the revocable trust. That distribution shall be without liability to any creditor of the settlor unless the claim of that creditor is known to the trustee within 13 months after the first complete advertisement of the grant of letters to the personal representative or, if no personal representative has been appointed, within one year after the first complete advertisement under subsection (c). (f) Rights of creditors against distributed property.-- (1) No creditor shall have any claim against personal property distributed by the trustee of a revocable trust at the trustee's own risk under subsection (e) unless the claim of the creditor is known to the trustee within 13 months after the first complete advertisement of the grant of letters to the personal representative or, if no personal representative has been appointed, within one year after the first complete advertisement of the trust under subsection (c). (2) No creditor shall have any claim against real property distributed by the trustee of a revocable trust at the trustee's own risk under subsection (e) unless the creditor, within one year after the settlor's death, files a written notice of claim with the clerk. The claim against real property shall expire at the end of five years after the settlor's death unless within that time the trustee files an account or the creditor files a petition to compel an accounting.

(a) If unspecified.-- If neither the terms of a trust nor a separate written agreement signed by the settlor or anyone who is authorized by the terms of the trust to do so specifies the trustee's compensation, the trustee is entitled to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances. Neither a compensation provision in the terms of a trust nor a fee agreement governs compensation payable from trust principal unless it explicitly so provides. (b) If specified; adjustment.-- If the terms of a trust or written fee agreement signed by the settlor or anyone who is authorized by the terms of the trust to do so specifies a trustee's compensation, the trustee is entitled to the specified compensation. The court may allow reasonable compensation that is more or less than that specified if: (1) the duties of the trustee have become substantially different from those contemplated when the trust was created or when the fee agreement was executed; (2) the compensation specified in the terms of the trust or fee agreement would be unreasonable; or (3) the trustee performed extraordinary services, and the trustee's compensation for those services is not specified in the terms of the trust or fee agreement. (c) Entitlement not barred.-- None of the following shall bar a trustee's entitlement to compensation from the income or principal of the trust: (1) The trust is perpetual or for any other reason has not yet terminated. (2) The trustee's term of office has not yet ended. (3) The trustee of a testamentary trust also acted as a personal representative of the settlor and was or might have been compensated for services as a personal representative from the principal of the settlor's estate. (d) Court authority.-- In determining reasonable compensation, the court may consider, among other facts, the market value of the trust and may determine compensation as a fixed or graduated percentage of the trust's market value. The court may allow compensation from principal, income or both and determine the frequency with which compensation may be collected. Compensation at levels that arise in a competitive market shall be presumed to be reasonable in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary. (e) Cemetery lots.-- The authority in this section to pay compensation from trust principal shall not apply to trusts created by cemetery lot owners as endowments for the endowed care and maintenance of burial or cemetery lots if the principal sum involved is less than $20,000. Compensation shall be paid exclusively from the income of such trusts. (July 15, 2024, P.L.786, No.64, eff. 90 days) 2024 Amendment. Act 64 amended subsecs. (a) and (b).

(a) Duty to respond to requests.-- A trustee shall promptly respond to a reasonable request by the settlor of a trust or by a beneficiary of an irrevocable trust for information related to the trust's administration. A trustee shall promptly respond to the Department of Human Services' reasonable request for information related to the trust's administration when a settlor or beneficiary is a resident in a State-owned facility or an applicant for or recipient of cash or medical assistance from the Commonwealth and the department certifies in writing that it has obtained a currently valid consent for the disclosure of such information from the settlor or beneficiary of the trust. A trustee may rely upon the department's certification without investigating its accuracy. (b) Notice after settlor of revocable trust has been adjudicated incapacitated.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of a revocable trust learns that the settlor has been adjudicated incapacitated, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to the settlor's guardian. (c) Notice after settlor of revocable trust has died.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of a revocable trust learns that the settlor has died, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to: (1) the settlor's personal representative; (2) the settlor's spouse or, if the settlor's spouse is incapacitated, the spouse's guardian; (3) each of the settlor's children who is sui juris and the guardian, if any, of each child who is not sui juris; and (4) the trust's current beneficiaries. (d) Notice after settlor of irrevocable trust has been adjudicated incapacitated.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of an irrevocable trust learns that the settlor has been adjudicated incapacitated, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to the trust's current beneficiaries. A revocable trust shall not be deemed irrevocable for the purposes of this subsection merely because the settlor has been adjudicated incapacitated. (e) Notice after settlor of irrevocable trust has died.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of an irrevocable trust learns that the settlor has died, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to the trust's current beneficiaries unless the settlor had been adjudicated incapacitated and the trustee sent notices to the current beneficiaries as required by subsection (d). (f) Notice to current beneficiaries.-- No later than 30 days after the date on which the trustee of an irrevocable trust learns that a person who did not previously receive the notice described in subsection (i) is a current beneficiary of the trust, the trustee shall send the notice described in subsection (i) to the current beneficiary if, at that time, the trustee knows that the settlor is then deceased or has been adjudicated incapacitated. With respect to a testamentary trust, the time specified in this subsection commences to run when the trust is first funded, whether or not the trust is completely funded on that date. (g) Change in trusteeship.-- (1) Each time there is a change in trusteeship of any trust, the trustee shall notify the settlor in writing of the change. (2) Each time there is a change in trusteeship of any trust whose settlor is deceased or of an irrevocable trust whose settlor has been adjudicated incapacitated, the trustee shall notify the current beneficiaries in writing of the change. (3) Notice under this subsection shall include the trustee's name, address and telephone number. (h) Trustee's notice to any beneficiary at any time.-- Apart from the requirements of this section, the trustee may send the notice described in subsection (i) to any beneficiary of the trust at any time. (i) Contents of notice.-- Except as provided in subsection (g), any notice under this section shall be written and convey the following information: (1) The fact of the trust's existence. (2) The identity of the settlor. (3) The trustee's name, address and telephone number. (4) The recipient's right to receive upon request a copy of the trust instrument. (5) Each current beneficiary's right to receive, at least annually, upon request, periodic written financial reports concerning the trust. (6) The name, address and telephone number of each trust director. (j) Waiver.-- Any beneficiary may waive in writing the right to receive the notice described in subsection (i) and thereafter may rescind in writing that waiver. (k) Notice to settlor's appointee.-- The terms of a trust may provide that the settlor may appoint one or more persons or a succession of persons to receive, on behalf of one or more named current beneficiaries of the trust, the notices required by this section. The trustee giving the notice required by this section to that appointee satisfies the trustee's duty to give to the named current beneficiary the notice required by this section if: (1) the trustee notifies the appointee that the notice is being given to the appointee as representing the named current beneficiary; and (2) the appointee does not decline to receive the notice in a writing delivered to the trustee no later than 30 days after receipt of the trustee's notice. (k.1) Nomination by current beneficiary.-- In a writing given to the trustee, a current beneficiary of a trust may nominate another person to receive, on behalf of the current beneficiary, the notices required by this section. By giving the notices required by this section to the nominee of the current beneficiary, the trustee satisfies the trustee's duty to give to the current beneficiary the notices required by this section if: (1) the trustee notifies the nominee that the notice is being given to the nominee as representative of the current beneficiary and that future notices required by this section will be given to the nominee in the same capacity; and (2) the nominee does not decline to receive the notices on behalf of the current beneficiary in a writing given to the trustee no later than 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (1). (k.2) Reliance on nomination.-- The trustee may rely upon the current beneficiary's nomination of another person to receive the notices required by this section on behalf of the current beneficiary and the nominee's presumed acceptance of that representation under subsection (k.1)(2) until the trustee receives a written rescission of the nomination from the current beneficiary or a written declination to receive further notices from the nominee. No such rescission or declination shall render ineffective any notice given by the trustee to the nominee before the trustee received the rescission or declination. (l) Applicability.-- (1) If the death or adjudication of incapacity described in subsection (b), (c), (d) or (e) occurs on or after November 6, 2006, the time limit for notice set forth in that subsection shall apply. (2) If the death or adjudication of incapacity described in subsection (b), (d) or (e) has occurred before November 6, 2006, the time limit for notice set forth in that subsection shall be November 6, 2008. (3) The notice under subsection (f) shall not be required to be completed until two years after November 6, 2006. (Oct. 27, 2010, P.L.837, No.85; July 8, 2016, P.L.497, No.79, eff.

(b) Tortious liability.-- Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a trustee who holds an interest as a general partner is not personally liable for torts committed by the partnership or for obligations arising from ownership or control of the interest unless the trustee is personally at fault. (c) When immunity inapplicable.-- The immunity provided by this section does not apply if an interest in the partnership is held by: (1) the trustee in a capacity other than that of trustee; (2) the trustee's spouse; or (3) the trustee's descendant, sibling or parent or the spouse of a descendant, sibling or parent.

(b) Authentication.-- A certification of trust may be signed or otherwise authenticated by any trustee. (c) Assurance of representations.-- A certification of trust must state that the trust has not been revoked, modified or amended in a manner that would cause the representations contained in the certification of trust to be incorrect. (d) Dispositive trust provisions.-- A certification of trust need not contain the dispositive terms of the trust. (e) Provisions to be made available upon request.-- A recipient of a certification of trust may require the trustee to furnish copies of those excerpts from the original trust instrument and later amendments which designate the trustee and confer upon the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction. (f) Reliance on certification.-- A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without knowledge that the representations contained in the certification are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification. Knowledge of the terms of the trust may not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying upon the certification. (g) Enforcement.-- A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in reliance upon a certification of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification were correct. (h) Liability.-- A person making a demand for the trust instrument in addition to a certification of trust or excerpts is liable for damages if the court determines that the person did not act in good faith in demanding the trust instrument.

(2) A claim not barred by paragraph (1) may nevertheless be barred by subsection (b). (3) In a writing given to the trustee, a beneficiary of a trust may nominate another person to receive, on behalf of the beneficiary, the reports required by this section. By giving the reports required by this section to the nominee of the beneficiary, the trustee satisfies the trustee's duty to give the beneficiary the reports required by this section if: (i) the trustee notifies the nominee that the report and future reports required by this section are being given to the nominee as representative of the beneficiary; and (ii) the nominee does not decline to receive reports on behalf of the beneficiary in a writing given to the trustee no later than 60 days after receipt of the notice described in this subsection. (4) The trustee may rely upon the beneficiary's nomination of another person to receive the reports required by this section on behalf of the beneficiary and the nominee's presumed acceptance of that representation under this subsection until the trustee receives a written rescission of the nomination from the beneficiary or a written declination to receive further reports from the nominee. No such rescission or declination shall render ineffective any report given by the trustee to the nominee before the trustee received the rescission or declination. (b) Five-year absolute bar.-- If not previously barred by subsection (a) or section 7798 (relating to failure to present claim at audit): (1) Except as provided in paragraph (1.1), (2) or (3), a claim by a beneficiary against a trustee, including a claim preserved by the beneficiary notifying the trustee in the manner described in subsection (a), shall be barred five years after the first to occur of the following events: (i) the date after the removal, resignation or death of the trustee on which the beneficiary was given the notice required by section 7780.3(g) (relating to duty to inform and report); (ii) the termination of the beneficiary's interest in the trust; or (iii) the termination of the trust. (1.1) A beneficiary who has challenged a transaction or asserted a claim as provided in subsection (a)(1)(iii) may not challenge the transaction or assert the claim against the trustee in a court or an arbitration proceeding commenced more than five years after the date the trustee sent the beneficiary the report described in subsection (a)(1)(i) and (ii). (2) Except as set forth in paragraph (3), if the first to occur of the events set forth in paragraph (1) occurred before November 6, 2006, a claim described in paragraph (1) shall be barred five years after November 6, 2006. (3) A claim described in paragraph (1) or (1.1) is not barred if, prior to the respective date set forth in either paragraph (1) or (2), the trustee has filed an account with the court or the beneficiary has petitioned the court to compel the trustee to file an account.

      "text": "§ 7799.3. Pooled trusts for individuals with disabilities. (a) Scope.-- This section relates to pooled trusts. (b) Organization of pooled trust.-- (1) A pooled trust shall be administered by a trustee governed by a board. The trust may employ persons as necessary. (2) The members of a board and employees of a trustee, if any, shall stand in a fiduciary relationship to the beneficiaries and the trustee regarding investment of the trust and shall not profit, either directly or indirectly, with respect to the investment. (3) A trustee shall maintain a separate account for each beneficiary of a pooled trust; but, for purposes of investment and management of funds, the trustee may pool these accounts. The trustee shall have exclusive control and authority to manage and invest the money in the pooled trust in accordance with this section, subject, however, to the exercise of that degree of judgment, skill and care under the prevailing circumstances that persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence who are familiar with investment matters exercise in the management of their affairs, considering the probable income to be derived from the investment and the probable safety of their capital. The trustee may charge a trust management fee to cover the costs of administration and management of the pooled trust. (4) A board member shall disclose and abstain from participation in a discussion or voting on an issue if a conflict of interest arises with the board member on a particular issue or vote. (5) No board member may receive compensation for services provided as a member of the board. No fees or commissions may be paid to a board member. A board member may be reimbursed for necessary expenses incurred which are in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the pooled trust as a board member upon presentation of receipts. (6) The trustee shall disburse money from a beneficiary's account for the sole benefit of the beneficiary. A disbursement from a beneficiary's account must have a reasonable relationship to the needs of the beneficiary. (c) Pooled trust fund.-- Before the funding of a pooled trust, all liens and claims in favor of the Department of Public Welfare for repayment of cash and medical assistance shall first be satisfied. All money received for pooled trust funds shall be deposited with a court-approved corporate fiduciary or with the State Treasury if no court-approved corporate fiduciary is available to the trustee. The funds shall be pooled for investment and management. A separate account shall be maintained for each beneficiary, and quarterly accounting statements shall be provided to each beneficiary by the trustee. The court-approved corporate fiduciary or the State Treasury shall provide quarterly accounting statements to the trustee. The court-approved corporate fiduciary or the State Treasury may charge a trust management fee to cover the costs of managing the funds in the pooled trust. (d) Reporting.-- (1) In addition to reports required to be filed under 15 Pa.C.S. Pt. III (relating to partnerships and limited liability companies), the trustee shall file an annual report with the Office of Attorney General and the Department of Public Welfare, along with an itemized statement which shows the funds collected for the year, income earned, salaries paid, other expenses incurred and the opening and final trust balances. A copy of this statement shall be available to the beneficiary, settlor or designee of the settlor upon request. (2) The trustee shall prepare and provide each settlor or the settlor's designee annually with a detailed individual statement of the services provided to the settlor's beneficiary during the previous 12 months and of the services to be provided during the following 12 months. The trustee shall provide a copy of this statement to the beneficiary upon request. (e) Coordination of services.-- (1) The Department of Public Welfare shall review and approve the pooled trust of an applicant for medical assistance. (2) In the determination of eligibility for medical assistance benefits, the interest of a disabled beneficiary in a pooled trust that has been approved by the Department of Public Welfare shall not be considered as a resource for purposes of determining the beneficiary's eligibility for medical assistance. (3) No State agency may reduce the benefits or services available to an individual because that person is a beneficiary of a pooled trust. The beneficiary's interest in a pooled trust is not reachable in satisfaction of a claim for support and maintenance of the beneficiary. (f) Notice.-- The Office of Attorney General and the Department of Public Welfare shall make available information on the treatment of pooled trusts for the individuals with disabilities in the medical assistance program. (g) Applicability.-- This section shall apply to all of the following: (1) Pooled trusts established after March 8, 2003. (2) Accounts of individual beneficiaries established after March 8, 2003, in pooled trusts created before March 9, 2003. (h) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Beneficiary.\" An individual with a disability who has the right to receive services and benefits of a pooled trust. \"Board.\" A group of persons vested with the management of the business affairs of a trustee. \"Disability.\" A physical or mental impairment as defined in section 1614 of the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 1382c). \"Pooled trust.\" A trust which meets all of the following: (1) The trust contains assets of more than one beneficiary. (2) Each beneficiary is an individual with a disability. (3) The trust is managed by a nonprofit corporation. (4) A separate account is maintained for each beneficiary of the trust, but, for purposes of investment and management of funds, the trust pools these accounts. Accounts in the trust may be established by the parent, grandparent or legal guardian of the individual with a disability, by the individual with a disability or by a court. (5) The trust provides that any money remaining in a beneficiary's account upon the death of the beneficiary that is not retained by the trust will be paid to the Commonwealth, up to the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary. \"Trustee.\" A nonprofit organization that manages a pooled trust.

The request must explicitly and specifically identify donations of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts as distinct from traditional organs such as heart, liver, or lung or tissues under Subchapter B. The discussion must educate the surrogate decision maker about the process of recovery of vascularized composite allografts and must clearly define and explain all of the following: (i) What a vascularized composite allograft is, the benefit to the recipient and precisely what will be recovered. (ii) That any prior generalized authorization for an anatomical gift under Subchapter B does not include a gift of a hand, facial tissue, limb or other vascularized composite allograft. (iii) That permission for a gift of a hand, facial tissue, limb or other vascularized composite allograft must be given separately from the permission for a gift under Subchapter B. (iv) That the appearance of the individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital will be significantly altered after the recovery of the gift and that upon request the recovery team will perform reconstructive surgery on the individual at no cost to the individual, the individual's family or surrogate decision maker. In addition, the discussion must explain that the recovery of vascularized composite allografts may impact burial arrangements and that an open casket may not be possible. (v) That the identity of the individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital may not be able to be protected due to fingerprints or birthmarks. (2) A deceased donor authorization form shall be used which specifically identifies the option of authorizing a gift of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts. The form must include a provision which states that the surrogate decision maker and family of the individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital understands the relevant anatomical details of the donation, the alteration of the appearance of the individual, including the impact of the recovery of vascularized composite allografts upon funeral arrangements, and that, despite the best efforts of the organ procurement organization, the anonymity of the individual may not be protected. Further, the form must provide information about the nature of the discussion required under paragraph (1), including: (i) the date and time of the discussion; (ii) for individuals who hold a professional or occupational license, the names, addresses, telephone numbers and professional or occupational license numbers of the individuals who made the request for the donation and provided the information under paragraph (1); and (iii) a summary of the topics discussed and which surrogate decision maker authorized the gift of a vascularized composite allograft.

Testing and examination under this subparagraph shall comply with a denial or refusal to make a gift of a vascularized composite allograft or any limitation expressed by the individual with respect to the vascularized composite allograft, or a limitation in the provision of a ventilator or other life-sustaining measures, as specified in subsection (a)(3) or a revocation or amendment to a gift of a vascularized composite allograft as specified in a document in subsection (a)(3) or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615. The results of tests and examinations under this subparagraph shall be used or disclosed only: (A) to evaluate medical suitability for donation of a vascularized composite allograft and to facilitate the donation process; and (B) as required or permitted by law. (ii) Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (a)(3), the hospital may not withdraw any measures which are necessary to maintain the medical suitability of the vascularized composite allograft until the organ procurement organization or designated requestor, as appropriate, has had the opportunity to advise the surrogate decision maker of the option to make a gift of a vascularized composite allograft and has received or been denied authorization to proceed with recovery of the vascularized composite allograft. (c) Testing after death.-- Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (a)(3), after an individual's death, a person to whom an anatomical gift may pass under section 8662 (relating to donees and vascularized composite allografts) may conduct a test or examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of the vascularized composite allograft for its intended purpose. (d) Recipients.-- Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (a)(3) and as set forth in this subchapter, a person that accepts a gift of a vascularized composite allograft may allow embalming, burial or cremation and the use of remains in a funeral service. The person to whom the part passes under section 8662, upon the death of the individual and before embalming, burial or cremation, shall cause the vascularized composite allograft to be removed without unnecessary mutilation. (e) Physicians.-- Neither the physician who attends the individual at death nor the physician who determines the time of the individual's death may participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a vascularized composite allograft.
