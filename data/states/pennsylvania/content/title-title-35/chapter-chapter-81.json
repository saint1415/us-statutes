level by an EMS agency pursuant to sections 8125(b)(2) (relating to medical director of emergency medical services agency) and 8129(k) (relating to emergency medical services agencies) may function as a lower-level EMS provider for that EMS agency, as authorized by the EMS agency medical director, if the EMS agency permits.\n\n(2) Upon expiration of the biennial registration period, an EMS provider who is at or above the advanced EMT level and whose practice for an EMS agency has been downgraded pursuant to sections 8125(b)(2) and 8129(k) may choose to maintain current registration of the EMS provider's certification by meeting the biennial registration requirements for that certification.\n\n(3) An EMS provider who has a currently registered certification as an advanced EMT or higher-level EMS provider and does not meet the requirements for biennial registration of that certification may apply to and secure from the department registration of a lower-level EMS provider certification if the EMS provider meets the registration requirements for that certification.\n\n(4) Instead of a registration certificate, the department shall issue a lower-level certification to an EMS provider who does not already have that certification and applies for a registration of that certification under this subsection.\n\n(5) An EMS provider whose practice level has been downgraded

appropriate.\n\n(2) EMS providers and EMS vehicle operators who have a biennial certification registration requirement may secure an exception to the period of time in which they would otherwise need to meet continuing education requirements for biennial registration of their certifications, as the department deems appropriate. Before an EMS provider without a current biennial registration begins to work for an EMS agency, the EMS agency medical director must determine that the EMS provider has continuing competency in the knowledge and skills required to provide the services the EMS agency will assign to the EMS provider.\n\n(3) EMS providers may seek an exception to their continuing education requirements for certification registration by asking the department to endorse their relevant military training as satisfying some or all of the applicable continuing education requirements.\n\nEffective Date.Section 9(1) of Act 37 of 2009 provided that subsecs.

For purposes of this paragraph:\n\n(i) a responsible person is a person who has not engaged in any act contrary to justice, honesty or good morals which indicates that the person is likely to betray the public trust in carrying out the activities of an EMS agency or a person who has engaged in such conduct but has been rehabilitated and establishes that he or she is not likely to again betray the public trust;\n\n(ii) a person has a substantial ownership interest if the person has equity in the capital, stock or the profits of the EMS agency equal to 5% or more of the value of the property or assets of the EMS agency; and\n\n(iii) a person staffs an EMS agency if the person engages in an activity integral to operation of the EMS agency, including, but not limited to, making or participating in the making or execution of management decisions, providing EMS, billing, calltaking and dispatching.\n\n(2) The applicant meets supply and equipment requirements and each ambulance or other vehicle that will be used in providing EMS is adequately constructed and equipped and will be maintained and operated to safely and efficiently render the services offered.\n\n(3) The applicant will meet the staffing standards for its vehicles and services.\n\n(4) The applicant will provide safe and efficient services that are adequate for the emergency medical care, the treatment and comfort and, when appropriate, the transportation of patients.\n\n(5) The applicant will have an EMS agency medical director who, in addition to satisfying the criteria of section 8125(a) (relating to medical director of emergency medical services agency), satisfies other criteria the department may establish by regulation based on the types of vehicles and services the applicant intends to provide under the EMS agency license.\n\n(6) The applicant is in compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated under this chapter.\n\n(d) Persons under 18 years of age.--An EMS agency shall ensure that a person under 18 years of age, when providing EMS on behalf of the EMS agency, is directly supervised by an EMS provider who is at least 21 years of age who has the same or higher level of EMS provider certification and at least one year of active practice as an EMS provider.\n\n(e) Triennial registration.--An EMS agency's license is deemed registered for three years after the issuance. An EMS agency must register its license at three-year intervals by completing an application on a form or through an electronic application process prescribed by the department. The department shall act on the application within 90 days of receipt of a complete and accurate application. The department shall not deny a registration of a license without giving the applicant prior notice of the reason for denial and providing an opportunity for a hearing.\n\n(f) Nontransferability of license.--An EMS agency may not transfer its license.

Under such circumstances, the law enforcement officer shall permit the EMS provider access to the patient before the officer transports the patient. If, pursuant to a medical treatment protocol or medical command order, an EMS agency is required to transport to a receiving facility a patient whom a law enforcement officer has taken or wants to take into custody or whom the law enforcement officer believes needs to be spoken with immediately, the EMS agency shall transport the patient to a receiving facility, and the law enforcement officer shall have discretion to accompany the patient in the EMS vehicle and authority to employ security precautions deemed necessary by the law enforcement officer to ensure the safety of the officer and others, except that the security precautions shall not unreasonably interfere with the provision of EMS to the patient.\n\n(n) Cessation of operations.--Upon suspension or revocation of a license, the EMS agency shall cease operations and no person shall permit or cause the EMS agency to continue.\n\n(o) Discontinuance or reduction of service.--An EMS agency shall not discontinue providing service it is licensed to provide or reduce the hours when it provides service until a minimum of 90 days after notifying the department in writing of the change.

The initial registration of the EMS agency's license shall expire on the same date that the entity's license as an ambulance service or recognition as a QRS would have expired if it had remained in effect.\n\n(r) Exemptions.--The following are exempt from the licensing provisions of this chapter:\n\n(1) Privately owned vehicles not ordinarily used to transport patients.\n\n(2) An EMS agency licensed in another state and not under this chapter that is dispatched to respond to an emergency within this Commonwealth when an EMS vehicle or service licensed under this chapter is unable to respond within a reasonable time or its response is not sufficient to deal with the emergency.\n\n(3) An EMS agency licensed in another state that limits its operations in this Commonwealth to the transportation and provision of medical care incidental to transportation of patients and other persons requiring transportation by EMS vehicles from locations outside this Commonwealth to locations within this Commonwealth.\n\n(4) EMS vehicles owned and operated by an agency of the Federal Government.\n\nEffective Date.Section 9(1) of Act 37 of 2009 provided that section 8129 shall take effect 180 days after the publication of the notice in section 7.
