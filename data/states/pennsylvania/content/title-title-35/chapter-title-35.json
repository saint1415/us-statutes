(2) Section 5303(c) and (d), to the extent necessary in construing any of those subsections, apply to all planned communities created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those subsections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring 180 days after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those planned communities. (c) Nonflexible planned communities.-- If a planned community created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains no more than 12 units and is not a flexible planned community, it is subject only to sections 5105, 5106, 5107 and 5218 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that planned community.

(e) Nonresidential units.-- This subpart does not apply to a planned community in which all units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use unless the declaration provides that the subpart does apply to that planned community. This subpart applies to a planned community containing both units which are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use and other units which are not so restricted only if the declaration so provides or if the real estate comprising the units which may be used for residential purposes would be a planned community in the absence of the units which may not be used for residential purposes. (f) Planned communities outside Commonwealth.-- This subpart does not apply to planned communities or units located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions under sections 5402 (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) through 5405 (relating to public offering statement; planned community securities) shall apply to all contracts for the disposition thereof signed in this Commonwealth by any purchaser unless exempt under section 5401(b)(2) (relating to applicability; waiver).

If a member elects to receive this previous State service credit, The Pennsylvania State University shall make employer contributions equal to the amount that would have been contributed had employer contributions been made to the system concurrently with the rendering of the service, plus valuation interest to the day of the crediting of the service. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the amount due as member contributions and interest for an employee who is employed by the Applied Research Laboratory on June 3, 1984, who elects to purchase this credit with the State Employees' Retirement System shall not exceed the amount of contributions and interest certified as having been made to the pension plan administered by the Applied Research Laboratory during his employment with the Applied Research Laboratory. The Pennsylvania State University shall pay as member contributions the difference between this amount and the amount otherwise due under sections 5504 and 5506. The additional contributions paid by The Pennsylvania State University shall not be considered compensation for purposes of this part. (d) Transfer of certain pension service credit.-- (1) Any person who was an employee of any county in this Commonwealth on the personal staff of an appellate court judge prior to September 9, 1985, and who had that employment transferred to the Commonwealth pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 3703 (relating to local chamber facilities) shall be a member of the system for all service rendered as an employee of the Commonwealth on the personal staff of an appellate court judge subsequent to the date of the transfer unless specifically prohibited pursuant to section 5301(c) (relating to mandatory and optional membership in the system and participation in the plan). The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service credit in that county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous county employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer, by the member, county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's county or municipal pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the county or municipal pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by December 31, 1987, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by December 31, 1987. If the amount transferred to the system by the member of a county or municipal pension plan or retirement system is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service in accordance with county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system benefit provisions, multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members. The Public Employee Retirement Study Commission shall determine the appropriate amount of employer contributions to be transferred to the system by the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems. (2) If the member died prior to the effective date of this subsection, the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1). In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by December 31, 1987. If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before January 1, 1988, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by March 31, 1988. If the member dies after December 31, 1987, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), neither the member or his estate shall receive credit for the prior service. (e) Transfer and purchase of certain pension service credit; Philadelphia Regional Port Authority.-- (1) Any employee of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority who becomes a State employee, as defined in section 5102 (relating to definitions), and an active member of the system shall be eligible to obtain retirement credit for prior uncredited service with the Philadelphia Port Corporation, a Pennsylvania not-for-profit corporation (\"predecessor corporation\"), provided that the Commonwealth does not incur any liability for the funding of the annuities attributable to the prior, uncredited \"predecessor corporation\" service, the cost of which shall be determined according to paragraph (2). (2) The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service in the \"predecessor corporation\" transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, the provisions of section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer by the member or the \"predecessor corporation\" to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the member's pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by June 30, 1992, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the \"predecessor corporation\" pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by June 30, 1992. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall pay as pick-up contributions the difference between the amount credited to the member's account and the amount otherwise due under section 5504. Such additional contributions paid by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall not be considered compensation for the purposes of this part. If the amount transferred to the system by the member is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members so long as the amount to be transferred is equal to or less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee. In the event that the amount required to be transferred is greater than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee shall be transferred to the system, and the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system the additional funds needed to satisfy the requirements of the calculation in this paragraph. If the amount required to be transferred is less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority may retain the amount not needed for transfer. (3) If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before July 1, 1992, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or may request that the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by September 30, 1992. If the member dies after June 30, 1992, without making the transfer or without requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), neither the member nor his estate shall receive credit for the prior service. (4) Any person who became employed by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority between July 10, 1989, and passage of this act and who becomes a State employee, as defined in section 5102, and an active member of the system shall be eligible to obtain retirement credit for service from the date of employment with the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, provided that the contributions are made in accordance with sections 5501, 5504, 5505.1 and 5506. (f) Transfer of certain pension service credit; Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network.-- (1) An active member who is an employee of the Office of Attorney General and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network on December 31, 1992, shall be eligible to obtain State service credit for service with the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network for the period December 1, 1988, to July 31, 1991, upon payment of the required contributions by the member and Office of Attorney General and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network if the provisions of this subsection are satisfied. (2) The employee shall elect to receive the credit by filing an application with the board while an active member no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act. (3) Contributions to be paid by an active member for credit for New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be sufficient to provide an amount equal to the regular and additional accumulated deductions which would have been standing to the credit of the member for such service had regular and additional member contributions been made to the board with full coverage as a Class A member during the period of New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and had these regular and additional accumulated deductions been credited with statutory interest up to the date of purchase. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account. The amount of members' contributions so determined by the board shall be the obligation of the member who requested credit for New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and in no event shall such amount be an obligation of the Office of Attorney General and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network or the State of New Jersey Retirement System. (4) Contributions to be paid by either the Office of Attorney General or the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network on account of credit for service as an employee of the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network during the period of December 1, 1988, through July 31, 1991, shall be equal to the full actuarial cost of the increased benefit obtained by virtue of the service, reduced by the member's contribution payable in a lump sum as calculated under paragraph (3). Contributions paid by the Office of Attorney General shall be made out of Regional Information Sharing Systems Program grants and Federal funds received from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, United States Department of Justice, and in no event shall the contributions be the obligation of any other fund of the Commonwealth. The contributions shall not be considered compensation for purposes of this part. The full actuarial cost of the increased benefit attributable to the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be the difference between subparagraphs (i) and (ii) less the member's contribution: (i) the present value of a standard single life annuity, beginning at the earliest possible superannuation age, calculated assuming a 6.5% future salary increase, a 9% interest rate and standard postretirement mortality, assuming credit for the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service to be purchased; and (ii) the present value of a standard single life annuity, beginning at the earliest possible superannuation age, calculated assuming a 6.5% future salary increase, a 9% interest rate, standard postretirement mortality, excluding credit for the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service to be purchased. (5) The earliest possible superannuation age shall be the age at which the member becomes first eligible for superannuation retirement assuming continued full-time service and credit for the amount of service which the member has elected to purchase or the current attained age of the member, whichever is later. (6) The payment shall be made in lump sum by either the Office of Attorney General or the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network within 90 days of certification by the board of the required contribution amount and shall be credited to the State accumulation account. (7) In the event neither the Office of Attorney General nor the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network makes the required contributions within the specified time, the State service credited shall be canceled, and any member contributions made pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be refunded to the member. (8) In no event shall New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service be creditable if the member has received, is entitled to receive, eligible to receive now or in the future or is receiving retirement benefits for such service or has retirement credit or has now or acquires in the future retirement credit under a retirement system administered and wholly or partially paid for by any other governmental agency or by any private employer or a retirement program approved by the employer in accordance with section 5301(a)(12). In the event that State service credit is granted for New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and the member subsequently receives credit for such service that is prohibited by this paragraph, the State service credited shall be canceled and any member contributions made pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be refunded to the member. (9) In the event the member is or was an annuitant, any annuity paid or payable during the period of such service with the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network shall be canceled retroactive to the date the member began service with the New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network, any such annuity payments made to the member shall be repaid by the member, and the provisions of section 5706 (relating to termination of annuities) shall apply if applicable. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account. The amount of annuity repayments so determined by the board shall be the obligation of the member who requested credit for New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service, and in no event shall such amount be an obligation of the Office of Attorney General and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network. (10) In no event shall a member be eligible to receive credit for service to the State of New Jersey or service credited in the New Jersey Retirement System other than service rendered to the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network. (g) Credit for employees of Juvenile Court Judges' Commission.-- An employee of the Juvenile Court Judges' Commission who elects membership in an independent retirement program approved by the employer under section 5301(f) shall have all service credited pursuant to section 5302(a) (relating to credited State service) for State service with the Juvenile Court Judges' Commission on or after the effective date of the interagency transfer canceled and thereafter ineligible to be credited as State service. Additionally, all creditable State service and nonstate service reinstated or purchased while an employee of the Juvenile Court Judges' Commission shall be canceled.

(a) General rule.-- In order to operate a limousine service within a city of the first class, the limousine service must have a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority under section 5741.1 (relating to power of authority). The authority may grant a certificate of public convenience to provide limousine service if the authority determines that the applicant is capable of providing safe, adequate, lawful and dependable service to the public. The authority may by regulation define categories of limousine service. The authority may separately grant certificates of public convenience for each category of limousine service and specify the rights associated with the certificates of public convenience by category of limousine service. (a.1) Advance reservation limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service within a city of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon advance reservation: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate issued; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as part of a continuous trip. (a.2) Other limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide nonexclusive, scheduled limousine service may transport persons and their baggage to or from any airport, railroad station or hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class without advance reservation in accordance with rules and regulations established by the authority. (a.3) Commission limousine certificate holders.-- A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service in a city of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the commission authorizing limousine service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and their baggage: (1) to a city of the first class upon advance reservation and in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (2) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond the city of the first class upon advance reservation in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience, excluding service from any airport, railroad station and hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class. (b) Enforcement.-- (1) The provisions of this subchapter and the rules and regulations promulgated by the authority pursuant to this subchapter shall be enforced within cities of the first class by authority personnel. (2) The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission may initiate actions before the authority.

(2) A limousine service provider operating pursuant to an authority-issued certificate of public convenience and a filed tariff permitting the limousine service provider to charge mileage-based rates on the effective date of this paragraph shall be permitted to continue to charge mileage-based rates and to be regulated in the same manner as traditional limousine service providers. (d) Penalties involving certified limousines.-- Operating a certificated limousine in violation of this subchapter and authority regulations with regard to limousine service in a city of the first class or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745 (relating to civil penalties). (e) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a limousine or giving the appearance of offering limousine service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience, is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each subsequent offense. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as a limousine without a certificate of public convenience are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (f) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) In addition to penalties provided for in subsections (d) and (e), the authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles and equipment which are utilized to provide limousine service without a proper certificate of public convenience in a city of the first class or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and equipment and payment of the authority's costs associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction.

(a) General rule.-- Where two or more political subdivisions have entered into an agreement as provided by section 7513 (relating to agreements among political subdivisions), all bills and claims for expenses incurred by or for the local organization shall thereafter be paid in the first instance by the political subdivision named as agent in the agreement in the manner provided in section 7514 (relating to payments involving one political subdivision) as though the organization were coterminous with the political subdivision, and the organization shall be subject to all of the laws governing the making of contracts or purchases, the employment of persons or otherwise incurring financial obligations which apply to the political subdivision. (b) Accounting by agent.-- The political subdivision designated as agent shall, not later than the fifteenth day of each month, submit an itemized account of the expenses of the organization paid by it during the preceding calendar month to each of the other political subdivisions party to the agreement, together with a request for reimbursement of the proportionate share of expenses agreed to be paid by each of the other political subdivisions. (c) Reimbursement of agent.-- Each political subdivision requested to make reimbursement shall do so within 30 days after the request from the appropriation made for the payment of the expenses of the organization and, in the event of failure to do so, mandamus shall lie to compel the officers of the political subdivision to pay the agreed-upon proportionate share of the proper expenses of the organization out of the first moneys thereafter in the treasury of the political subdivision and not previously pledged to any other purpose. No political subdivision may be compelled to pay for any one year an amount greater than the amount estimated in the agreement as its proportionate share.

If the gift or grant of money is made to the organization, it shall be deposited in the treasury of the political subdivision named as agent in the agreement and shall be appropriated by the political subdivision for the purpose for which the gift or grant was made. Any expenditure made by the agent political subdivision from any gift or grant deposited in its treasury or reimbursed from any gift or grant deposited in the treasury of any other political subdivision shall not be included in computing the reimbursement requested from any other political subdivision under the agreement.",

      "text": "§ 7601. Compact enacted. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: Article I Purpose and Authorities This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this compact, the term \"states\" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and all U.S. territorial possessions. The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack. This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states. Article II General Implementation Each party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist. The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood. On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact. Article III Party State Responsibilities A. It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall: 1. review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resources shortages, civil disorders, insurgency or enemy attack; 2. review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency; 3. develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans; 4. assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries; 5. protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material; 6. inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness; and 7. provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities. B. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance to another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this compact shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information: 1. a description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, including, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building, inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue; 2. the amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed; and 3. the specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location. C. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities. Article IV Limitations Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer. Article V Licenses and Permits Whenever any person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise. Article VI Liability Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes. No party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness. Article VII Supplementary Agreements Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein shall preclude any state entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies. Article VIII Compensation Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state. Article IX Reimbursement Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense or other cost or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this article. Article X Evacuation Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees. Article XI Implementation A. This compact shall become effective immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon enactment by such state. B. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until 30 days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. C. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States Government. Article XII Validity This compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected. Article XIII Additional Provisions Nothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into Federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under section 1385 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

(c) Change in purpose of nonelectoral general obligation debt.-- In the case of nonelectoral general obligation debt, the purpose may be changed by similar action at any time.

(a) Liability of owner.-- (1) If an operator of a vehicle fails to pay the prescribed toll at any location where tolls are collected by means of electronic toll collection, the owner of the vehicle shall be liable to the commission for failure of the operator of the vehicle to comply with this section if the violation is evidenced by information obtained from a toll collection system. (2) The registration plate number of the vehicle as recorded by a toll collection system shall establish an inference that the owner of the vehicle was then operating the vehicle. The inference shall be overcome if the owner provides a written statement indicating the following: (i) that the owner was not operating the vehicle at the time of travel; and (ii) (Deleted by amendment). (iii) (Deleted by amendment). (iv) the name and residence address of the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel. (3) Failure to send the required information within 30 days of the original invoice date shall result in the owner being liable for the total amount due. (4) If the inference is overcome, the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel may be held liable under this section for failure to pay the prescribed toll in the same manner as if the operator were the owner of the vehicle. (b) Imposition of liability.-- Liability under this section shall be imposed upon an owner for failure to pay the prescribed toll charges assessed under this section or the regulations of the commission occurring within the territorial limits of this Commonwealth. Based on evidence obtained by a toll collection system, the following shall apply: (1) The commission or an authorized agent or employee must prepare and mail an invoice assessing the toll charges incurred as follows: (i) The invoice must be sent by first class mail to each person alleged to be liable as an owner. (ii) The invoice must be mailed at the address shown on the vehicle registration or at the address of the operator, as applicable. The invoice must be mailed no later than 60 days after: (A) the date of travel; or (B) the date the inference is overcome under subsection (a)(2). (iii) Personal service is not required. (iv) The invoice must contain all of the following: (A) Information advising the person charged of the manner and time in which the toll charges in the invoice may be contested. (B) A warning advising the person charged that failure to contest the invoice in the manner and time provided shall be deemed an admission of liability for the total amount due. (1.1) A manual or automatic record of mailing prepared in the ordinary course of business shall be prima facie evidence of the mailing of the invoice. (1.2) If mail, other than unclaimed mail, is returned undelivered, the commission may obtain address information from sources, such as the United States Postal Service, debt collection services, reviews of telephone directories or related skip-tracing practices, to locate an alternative address for the vehicle owner or the address of the operator, as applicable. (2) If an owner of a vehicle or an owner that is a lessor of a vehicle receives an invoice under this section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to a police department as having been stolen, it shall be a defense to the allegation of liability that the vehicle had been reported to the police as having been stolen prior to the time the travel occurred and that the vehicle had not been recovered by the time of the travel. For purposes of asserting the defense under this paragraph, it shall be sufficient that a certified copy of the police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by first class mail to the commission within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the owner or lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section. (3) An owner that is a lessor of a vehicle as to which an invoice was issued under paragraph (1) shall not be liable for tolls assessed in the invoice if the owner sends to the commission a copy of the rental, lease or other contract document covering the vehicle on the date of travel, with the name and address of the lessee clearly legible to the commission, within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section. If the lessor complies with the provisions of this section, the lessee of the vehicle on the date of travel shall be deemed to be the owner of the vehicle for purposes of this section and shall be subject to liability for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice under this section. (4) A certified report or a facsimile report of an authorized agent or employee of the commission reporting a violation of this section or regulations of the commission based upon the recorded information obtained from a toll collection system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in the report and shall be admissible as an official record kept in the ordinary course of business in any proceeding charging a violation of this section or the toll collection regulations of the commission. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, videotapes, photographs, microphotographs, other recorded images, written records, reports or facsimiles prepared pursuant to this section shall be for the exclusive use of the commission, its authorized agents, its employees and law enforcement officials for the purpose of discharging duties under this section and the regulations of the commission. The information shall not be deemed a public record under the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law. The information shall not be discoverable by court order or otherwise; nor shall it be offered in evidence in any action or proceeding which is not directly related to a violation of this section, the regulations of the commission or indemnification for liability imposed pursuant to this section. The restrictions set forth in this paragraph: (i) shall not be deemed to preclude a court of competent jurisdiction from issuing an order directing that the information be provided to law enforcement officials if the information is reasonably described and is requested solely in connection with a criminal law enforcement action; (ii) shall not be deemed to preclude the exchange of the information between any entities with jurisdiction over or which operate a toll collection system in this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction; and (iii) shall not be deemed to prohibit the use of information exclusively for the purpose of billing electronic toll collection accounts, deducting toll charges from accounts, enforcing toll collection laws and related regulations or enforcing the provisions of accounts. (6) An imposition of liability under this section must be based upon a preponderance of evidence. (7) An imposition of liability pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a conviction of an owner and shall not be made part of the motor vehicle operating record of the person upon whom the liability is imposed, nor shall it be considered in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage. (8) An owner that admits, is found liable or fails to pay the invoice resulting in a violation of this section shall be civilly liable to the commission for all of the following: (i) Either: (A) the amount of the toll evaded or attempted to be evaded if the amount can be determined; or (B) the maximum toll from the farthest point of entry on the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the actual point of exit if the amount of the toll evaded or attempted to be evaded cannot be determined. (ii) A reasonable administrative fee not to exceed $35 per notification. (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of the operator of a vehicle for a violation of this section or of the regulations of the commission. (c) Placement of electronic toll collection device.-- An electronic toll collection device which is affixed to the front windshield of a vehicle in accordance with the regulations of the commission shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 4524 (relating to windshield obstructions and wipers). (d) Privacy of electronic toll collection information.-- (1) Except as set forth under paragraph (2), notwithstanding any other provision of law, all of the following apply to information kept by the commission, its authorized agents or its employees which is related to an account for electronic toll collection and any information collected by a toll collection system: (i) The information shall be for the exclusive use of the commission, its authorized agents, its employees and law enforcement officials for the purpose of discharging their duties pursuant to this section and the regulations of the commission. This subparagraph includes names, addresses, account numbers, account balances, personal financial information, vehicle movement records and other information compiled by a toll collection system. (ii) The information shall not be deemed a public record under the Right-to-Know Law, nor shall it be discoverable by court order or otherwise or be offered in evidence in any action or proceeding which is not directly related to the discharge of duties under this section, the regulations of the commission or a violation of the terms in an account. (2) Paragraph (1) shall not be deemed to do any of the following: (i) Preclude a court of competent jurisdiction from issuing an order directing that the information be provided to law enforcement officials if the information is reasonably described and is requested solely in connection with a criminal law enforcement action. (ii) Preclude the exchange of the information between any entities with jurisdiction over or which operate a toll collection system in this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction. (iii) Prohibit the use of the information exclusively for the purpose of billing electronic toll collection accounts, deducting toll charges from an account, enforcing toll collection laws and related regulations or enforcing the provisions of an account. (d.1) Notice for posting video toll or flat video toll to customer account.-- (1) The commission shall indicate on an account statement if a video toll has been posted to the customer's account, including the date and the dollar amount of the video toll.

The notification shall include: (i) Information on proper placement of the electronic toll collection device. (ii) Information regarding replacement of the electronic toll collection device. (iii) Notice that failure to respond may result in additional flat video tolls and administrative fees posted to the account. (iv) Other information as determined by the commission. (4) The commission shall provide for an appeal process.

(a) General rule.-- All tax anticipation notes issued in a single fiscal year shall be equally and ratably secured by the pledge of, security interest in and a lien and charge on the taxes or revenues, or both, of the local government unit specified in the authorizing resolution to be received during the period when the notes will be outstanding. The pledge, lien and charge shall be fully perfected as against the local government unit, all creditors thereof and all third parties in accordance with the terms of the resolution from and after the filing of any financing statement or statements required under Title 13 (relating to commercial code). For the purpose of this filing, the sinking fund depository, if any, otherwise, the fiscal agent or paying agent designated in the notes, may act as the representative of noteholders and, in such capacity, execute and file the financing statement and any continuation or termination statements as secured party. The authorizing resolution may establish one or more sinking funds and provide for periodic or other deposits therein and may contain covenants or other provisions as the local government unit determines. The amount of any tax anticipation notes issued in compliance with this subpart shall be general obligations of the local government unit and, if the amounts are not paid within the fiscal year in which the notes were issued, they shall be deemed to be nonelectoral debt enforceable in the manner of a general obligation which, unless funded pursuant to this subpart, shall be included in the budget of the local government unit for the ensuing fiscal year and shall be payable from the taxes and revenues of the ensuing year, notwithstanding that the amount thereof shall cause the nonelectoral debt of the local government unit to exceed the limitations of Subchapter B of Chapter 80 (relating to limitations on debt of local government units). (b) First class school districts.-- The holder of the tax anticipation notes issued by a first class school district or the sinking fund depository of the applicable sinking fund, if any, shall have the right to enforce the pledge of security interest in and lien and charge on the pledged taxes and revenues of the first class school district against all Commonwealth and local public officials in possession of any of the taxes and revenues at any time which may be collected directly from the officials upon notice by the holder or depository for application to the payment as and when due or for deposit in the applicable sinking fund at the times and in the amounts specified in the tax anticipation notes. Any Commonwealth or local public official in possession of any of the taxes and revenues shall make payment, against receipt therefor, directly to the holder of the tax anticipation notes or to the depository upon the notice and shall thereby be discharged from any further liability or responsibility for the taxes and revenues. If the payment is to a holder of tax anticipation notes, it shall be made against surrender of the notes to the payor for delivery to the first class school district in the case of payment in full; otherwise, it shall be made against production of the notes for notation thereon of the amount of the payment. The provisions of this subsection with respect to the enforceability and collection of taxes and revenues which secure tax anticipation notes of a first class school district shall supersede any contrary or inconsistent statutory provision or rule of law. This subsection shall be construed and applied to fulfill the legislative purpose of clarifying and facilitating temporary borrowings by a first class school district by assuring to holders of tax anticipation notes the full and immediate benefit of the security therefor without delay, diminishment or interference based on any statute, decision, ordinance or administrative rule or practice.

(a) General rule.-- Whenever the governing body of a local government unit shall be of the opinion that it has outstanding unfunded debt, it may, by petition to the court of common pleas setting forth the facts, request approval for the issuance of bonds or notes to fund the unfunded debt. After hearing, on such notice to the local government unit and its taxpayers as the court may prescribe, the court shall make an order granting authority to fund all or a part of the unfunded debt if the court finds that the unfunded debt is a lawful obligation of the local government unit; that there has been an unforeseeable decline in revenues or that taxes levied have not produced the revenues anticipated or that it was not reasonable to foresee the obligation; that paying the debt by curtailing municipal services will be dangerous to the public health, safety or education; and that it is not feasible or not in the public interest to levy additional taxes in the current fiscal year. The funding debt so approved shall be stated to mature in the amounts and over the number of years, not exceeding ten, as the court finds will accomplish the payment of the debt without endangering the rendering of municipal services or requiring the levying of excessive taxes. If the funding of the unfunded debt has not been approved by a vote of the electors, the order of the court upon cause shown may fix the portion, if any, which shall not be charged against the nonelectoral debt limitations of the local government unit under sections 8022 (relating to limitations on incurring of other debt) and 8125 (relating to security for tax anticipation notes and sinking fund) during the time the funding debt is outstanding. (b) Issuance and sale of bonds or notes.-- The bonds or notes representing funding debt so authorized by the court shall be issued and sold by the governing body as provided by other provisions of this subpart in respect of general obligation bonds except as these provisions are modified by this section or by orders of the court issued under this section, and the proceedings filed by the local government unit in respect of the funding bonds under section 8201 (relating to certification to department of bond or note transcript or lease, guaranty, subsidy contract or other agreement) shall include certified copies of the petition and of the order of the court.

(a) General rule.-- No bonds or notes shall be issued with a stated maturity date exceeding the sooner to occur of: (1) Forty years from the date of the series of any bonds or notes issued to evidence debt for the purpose of financing the cost of actually constructing, acquiring or improving a project or a separately financed portion of a project or funding an unfunded actuarial accrued liability. (2) (i) The useful life of the project being financed as stated in the ordinance of the local government unit enacted in connection with the series of bonds or notes to be issued for the project, which statement in the ordinance shall be conclusive for all purposes. If projects have been combined for financing pursuant to section 8101 (relating to combining projects for financing or series of bonds or notes for sale) and the projects have different useful lives, it is sufficient for this section if an aggregate principal amount of bonds or notes equal to the separate cost of each project having a shorter useful life have been stated to mature prior to the end of the useful life, and the balance prior to the end of the longest useful life. For the purpose of this paragraph, the inclusion of furnishings, machinery, apparatus or equipment for a construction or acquisition project shall not be deemed to be the combining of projects, but the useful life of the project shall be that of the building, structure or improvement constructed or acquired. (ii) Where capital budgeting is practiced and bonds are issued to fund the current portion of a capital budget involving projects of varying useful lives, a uniform term of 30 years may be used. (iii) Where the project being financed is a countywide revision of assessment of real property, the useful life shall be a term of no more than ten years. (iv) Where a project consists of the funding of all or a portion of a reserve, or a contribution toward a combined reserve, pool or other arrangement, relating to self-insurance, the useful life shall be the term specified in the ordinance of the local government unit, not to exceed 20 years, or, if none is specified, then the useful life shall be deemed to be 20 years. (b) Mandatory redemption and stated maturities or installments.-- Bonds or notes may be serial bonds or notes or term bonds or notes or any combination thereof that may be selected by the governing body of the issuing local government unit. Except for bonds or notes issued to fund an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, if term bonds or notes are issued, the bonds or notes shall be subject to mandatory redemption, and, if serial or installment bonds or notes, the amounts of the stated maturities or installments shall be fixed: (1) so as to amortize the issue on at least an approximately level annual debt service plan during the period specified for the payment of principal in subsection (c); or (2) so that the debt service on outstanding debt of the same classification, and for this purpose lease rental debt shall be considered as the same classification as general obligation debt, will be brought more nearly into an overall level annual debt service plan. (c) Deferral of stated installments or maturities or mandatory redemption.-- Except as provided by subsection (e), stated installments or maturities of principal of any series of bonds or notes or the mandatory redemption of the principal may not be deferred beyond the later of two years from date of issue or one year after estimated completion of construction. In the case of revenue or guaranteed revenue bonds, this provision will be satisfied by a covenant for the mandatory application to term bonds of such revenues as may remain after payment of interest and operating expenses up to a fixed amount conforming to subsection (b) as shall be specified in the ordinance pursuant to which the bonds or notes are issued. (d) Fixing earlier maturity dates.-- This section does not prevent the fixing of the amount of stated maturity dates so that a greater percentage of a series will mature on earlier dates than those allowable by this subpart. (e) Maturity dates for different series.-- This section does not prevent the authorization of bonds or notes of an issue for sale in one or more series, in which case the first stated maturity of a later series may be later than, but not more than 15 months later than, the last stated maturity of the next preceding series.",
