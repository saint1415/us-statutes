If a 911 service provider's service location does not match the PSAPs' GIS data for address validation, the 911 service provider must provide the PSAP and appropriate addressing authority any known information about the service location.\n\n(3) A wireless provider shall provide the telephone number and geographical location of the wireless device, as required under the FCC E-911 Order, 47 CFR (relating to telecommunication) and any other applicable Federal law, to PSAPs for use in responding to 911 calls.

      "text": "(a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other law, in a response to a request under the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law, the agency or a PSAP may not release individual identifying information of an individual contacting a 911 center, victim or witness. Information includes, but is not limited to, voice, video and data provided through the use of next generation 911 technology or other forms of communication.\n\n(a.1) Call processing records.--A call processing record created by a PSAP shall be confidential, and the agency may not release the call processing record. The agency shall have access to a call processing record for troubleshooting and monitoring performance of the next generation 911 service or PSAP. The agency may analyze the data in a call processing record to assist with emergency management response and recovery operations. Aggregated statistical reports detailing next generation 911 service or PSAP usage and performance shall not be confidential. Nothing in this section shall be construed to rescind the duty of a PSAP to comply with the Right-to-Know Law.\n\n(b) Applicability.--This section shall not apply if the PSAP or a court determines that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the interest in nondisclosure.\n\n(c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \"identifying information\" includes, but is not limited to, name, telephone number, home address, voice, appearance or other data provided in 911 communications service that can be used to identify an individual. The term does not include:\n\n(1) The location of the incident, unless the location is the caller's, victim's or witness's home address or the disclosure of the location would compromise the identity of the caller, victim or witness.\n\n(2) The street block identifier, the cross street or the mile marker nearest the scene of the incident, which shall be public.\n\n(May 24, 2016, P.L.228, No.30, eff. 60 days; Nov. 18, 2024, P.L.1186, No.147, eff. imd.)",
