The department shall establish payment procedures that substantially coincide with the payment procedures of Article II of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, except the department may require the filing of returns and the payment of the surcharge by electronic means.\n\n(7) The assessment, audit, appeal, collection and enforcement procedures and other provisions of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 shall apply to the surcharge collected and remitted under this section.\n\n(8) The provision of section 5311.1 (relating to immunity) shall apply to prepaid wireless providers and sellers.\n\n(9) The surcharge shall be the only 911 funding obligation imposed regarding prepaid wireless telecommunications service in this Commonwealth.

Information includes, but is not limited to, voice, video and data provided through the use of next generation 911 technology or other forms of communication.\n\n(a.1) Call processing records.--A call processing record created by a PSAP shall be confidential, and the agency may not release the call processing record. The agency shall have access to a call processing record for troubleshooting and monitoring performance of the next generation 911 service or PSAP. The agency may analyze the data in a call processing record to assist with emergency management response and recovery operations. Aggregated statistical reports detailing next generation 911 service or PSAP usage and performance shall not be confidential. Nothing in this section shall be construed to rescind the duty of a PSAP to comply with the Right-to-Know Law.\n\n(b) Applicability.--This section shall not apply if the PSAP or a court determines that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the interest in nondisclosure.\n\n(c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \"identifying information\" includes, but is not limited to, name, telephone number, home address, voice, appearance or other data provided in 911 communications service that can be used to identify an individual. The term does not include:\n\n(1) The location of the incident, unless the location is the caller's, victim's or witness's home address or the disclosure of the location would compromise the identity of the caller, victim or witness.\n\n(2) The street block identifier, the cross street or the mile marker nearest the scene of the incident, which shall be public.\n\n(May 24, 2016, P.L.228, No.30, eff. 60 days; Nov. 18, 2024, P.L.1186, No.147, eff. imd.)",
