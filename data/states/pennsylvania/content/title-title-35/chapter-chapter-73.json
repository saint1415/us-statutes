The General Assembly further finds that the use of up to $50,000,000 of such indebtedness to expand the existing program providing for loans to volunteer fire companies, volunteer ambulance services and volunteer rescue squads as authorized under this subchapter is an appropriate use of such indebtedness.\n\n(b) Purpose.--The General Assembly has determined that fire companies and emergency medical services companies are most in need of loans. The General Assembly intends that the loans provided under this subchapter be used to replace outmoded or unsafe equipment and buildings of fire companies and emergency medical services companies to meet an increasing demand for a higher level of service in the communities which they serve.\n\n(Oct. 29, 2020, P.L.739, No.91, eff. 60 days)\n\n2020 Amendment.Act 91 amended subsec.
