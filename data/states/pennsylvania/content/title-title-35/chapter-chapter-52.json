Each practitioner or other person authorized by the secretary to accept a voluntary nonopioid directive form for filing shall date and affix his signature to the form in the presence of the patient as evidence of acceptance and shall provide a signed copy of the form to the patient.\n\n(2) The patient executing and filing a voluntary nonopioid directive form with a practitioner shall sign and date the form in the presence of the practitioner, a designee of the practitioner or other person authorized by the secretary to accept a voluntary nonopioid directive form for filing. In the case of a patient who is unable to execute and file a voluntary nonopioid form, the patient may designate a duly authorized guardian or health care proxy to execute and file the form in accordance with paragraph (1).\n\n(3) A patient may revoke the voluntary nonopioid directive form for any reason and may do so by written or oral means.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), before signing a voluntary nonopioid directive form a practitioner may, if deemed appropriate, assess the patient's personal and family history of alcohol or drug abuse and evaluate the patient's risk for medication misuse or abuse. In evaluating such risks, the practitioner shall access the system to determine whether an unusual or suspect pattern for the prescribing of controlled substances containing opioids to the patient has been reported to the system. If a practitioner reasonably believes that a patient is at risk for substance misuse or abuse or a practitioner believes in the practitioner's expert medical opinion that for any other reason the nonopioid directive is appropriate, the practitioner shall sign the form. The practitioner signing the nonopioid directive form shall note doing so in the patient's medical record.",
