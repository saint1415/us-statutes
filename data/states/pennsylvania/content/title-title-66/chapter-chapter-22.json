In its restructuring filing, the natural gas distribution company shall establish system reliability standards and capacity contract mitigation parameters and address the unbundling of commodity, capacity, storage, balancing and aggregator services. The commission may address the unbundling of other services only through a rulemaking. In conducting the rulemaking, the commission shall consider the impact of such unbundling on the labor force, the creation of stranded costs, safety, reliability, consumer protections, universal service and the potential for unbundling to offer savings, new products and additional choices or services to retail gas customers. The commission's decisions shall assure that standards and procedures for safety and reliability, consumer protections and universal service are maintained at levels consistent with this chapter.\n\n(4) Consistent with the provisions of section 2204, the commission shall require that a natural gas distribution company that owns or operates jurisdictional distribution facilities shall provide distribution service to all retail gas customers in its service territory and to all natural gas suppliers, affiliated or nonaffiliated, on nondiscriminatory rates, terms of access and other conditions.\n\n(5) The commission shall require that restructuring of the natural gas utility industry be implemented in a manner that does not unreasonably discriminate against one customer class for the benefit of another.\n\n(6) After notice and hearings, the commission shall establish for each natural gas distribution company an appropriate nonbypassable, competitively neutral cost-recovery mechanism which is designed to recover fully the natural gas distribution company's universal service and energy conservation costs over the life of these programs. Except as provided in paragraph (10), policies, activities and services under this paragraph shall be funded and spent in each natural gas distribution company's service territory. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit public funding or voluntary funding by third parties of a natural gas distribution company's universal service and energy conservation programs.\n\n(7) The commission shall, at a minimum, continue the level and nature of the consumers protections, policies and services within its jurisdiction that are in existence as of the effective date of this chapter to assist low-income retail gas customers to afford natural gas services.\n\n(8) The commission shall ensure that universal service and energy conservation policies, activities and services are appropriately funded and available in each natural gas distribution service territory.

      "text": "(a) Commencement of customer choice.--Beginning on November 1, 1999, unless the commission for good cause shown extends this period by no more than eight months, consistent with this chapter, all retail gas customers of natural gas distribution companies other than city natural gas distribution operations shall have the opportunity to purchase natural gas supply services from a natural gas supplier or their natural gas distribution company to the extent it offers such services. The choice of natural gas suppliers shall rest with the retail gas customer. The commission shall adopt orders, rules, regulations and policies as shall be necessary and appropriate to implement fully this chapter within the time frames specified in this chapter, provided that the commission may, in the context of each natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, establish the time frames for implementation of specific components of each natural gas distribution company's restructuring plan.\n\n(b) Restructuring filings.--All natural gas distribution companies in this Commonwealth, except city natural gas distribution operations, shall file with the commission, pursuant to a schedule to be determined by the commission in consultation with the natural gas distribution companies, a restructuring filing consistent with this chapter and with any orders, rules or regulations adopted by the commission. A city natural gas distribution operation shall file with the commission its restructuring filing pursuant to section 2212 (relating to city natural gas distribution operations).\n\n(c) Commission review.--\n\n(1) The commission shall review the restructuring filing of each natural gas distribution company and shall, after open evidentiary hearings with proper notice and opportunity for all parties to cross-examine witnesses and brief issues, issue an order accepting, modifying or rejecting such filing at the earliest date possible, but no later than nine months from the filing date.\n\n(2) In issuing the restructuring order, the commission may consider the results of any collaborative process previously engaged in during or prior to the restructuring proceeding.\n\n(3) If the commission modifies or rejects a restructuring filing, it shall state the specific reasons for modification or rejection and direct the natural gas distribution company to address such objections with another filing within 30 days of the entry date of the commission order modifying or rejecting the prior filing.\n\n(4) The commission shall review the alternative filing, solicit comments and reply comments from interested parties and issue a final order within 45 days of the revised filing.\n\n(5) The restructuring filing for a city natural gas distribution operation shall also include an initial tariff filing.\n\n(d) Release, assignment or transfer of capacity.--\n\n(1) A natural gas distribution company holding contracts for firm storage or transportation capacity, including gas supply contracts with Pennsylvania producers, on the effective date of this chapter, or a city natural gas distribution operation on the date the commission assumes jurisdiction over such city natural gas distribution operation, may at its option release, assign or otherwise transfer such capacity or Pennsylvania supply, in whole or part, associated with those contracts on a nondiscriminatory basis to licensed natural gas suppliers or large commercial or industrial customers on its system.\n\n(2) Contracts which by their terms must be renewed within 150 days after the effective date of this chapter or, with respect to a city natural gas distribution operation, within 90 days after the date the commission assumes jurisdiction over such city natural gas distribution operation or contracts for which the last day for notice of renewal or nonrenewal pursuant to the notice provision of the contract has occurred or is within 150 days after the effective date of this chapter or, with respect to a city natural gas distribution operation, within 90 days after the date the commission assumes jurisdiction over such city natural gas distribution operation and which are renewed pursuant to such notice requirements shall also be subject to the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(3) Such release, assignment or transfer shall be at the applicable contract rate for such capacity or Pennsylvania supply and shall be subject to applicable contractual arrangements and tariffs. The amount so released, assigned or transferred shall be sufficient to serve the level of the customers' requirements for which the natural gas distribution company has procured such capacity, determined in accordance with the natural gas distribution company's tariff or procedures approved in its restructuring proceedings.\n\n(4) The licensed natural gas supplier shall accept such release, assignment or transfer of that capacity or Pennsylvania supply and enter into all applicable contracts or agreements as a condition of serving retail gas customers on the natural gas distribution company's system.\n\n(5) On or after July 1, 2002, or, in the case of a city natural gas distribution operation, March 1, 2005, the commission shall have the authority to prevent such assignments, releases or transfers under either of the following circumstances:\n\n(i) the natural gas distribution company, alone or together with one or more natural gas suppliers, voluntarily proposes an alternative to such assignments, releases or transfers and the commission finds such alternative to be in the public interest; or\n\n(ii) upon the petition of the licensed natural gas supplier who desires to use alternate interstate storage or transportation capacity to serve its customers on the natural gas distribution company's system, the commission makes the following findings and issues a final order as to which all appeals have been exhausted in which:\n\n(A) The commission finds that the alternate capacity which the natural gas supplier seeks to utilize meets the operational needs and reliability standards of the natural gas distribution company.\n\n(B) The commission confirms that the natural gas distribution company's specific transportation and storage capacity contracts to be displaced are no longer needed to serve firm customers of the natural gas distribution company.\n\n(C) The commission authorizes the natural gas distribution company to follow a specific, written mitigation plan approved by the commission or, if such a plan is not approved or applicable, to post the displaced capacity for release in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and applicable requirements of interstate pipelines.\n\n(D) The commission authorizes the natural gas distribution company to recover the difference between the amount the natural gas distribution company is required to pay under the applicable contract terms for the capacity released, assigned or transferred pursuant to clause (C) and the amount the natural gas distribution company receives from an entity, if any, that acquires such capacity. Under no circumstances, however, shall such recovery result in shifting of costs between customer classes or in any increase in rates to customers who continue to purchase natural gas supplies from the natural gas distribution company acting in its supplier of last resort function.\n\n(6) Prior to making the filing provided for in paragraph (5), the natural gas supplier shall meet with the natural gas distribution company to discuss the natural gas supplier's proposed alternatives to the existing gas supply or capacity contracts or to their mandatory assignment.\n\n(7) Those natural gas distribution companies having gas supply contracts with Pennsylvania producers may address the issue of post-July 1, 2002, assignment of such contracts in their restructuring proceeding or thereafter.\n\n(e) New and renewed capacity.--\n\n(1) Subject to the service obligations imposed by this title, and to the extent such capacity is not needed to meet the natural gas distribution company's least-cost fuel procurement and other applicable standards pursuant to this title, prior to entering into new or renewed contracts for firm storage or transportation capacity not subject to subsection (d)(1), (2), (3) or (4), each natural gas distribution company shall offer on a nondiscriminatory basis to each natural gas supplier licensed to do business on its system, and to large volume industrial or commercial customers of the natural gas distribution company being served by such contracts, the opportunity to renew such contracts, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or to enter into other contracts for capacity.\n\n(2) The capacity shall meet the reliability criteria of the natural gas distribution company and, in the case of large volume industrial and commercial customers being served by such contracts, shall meet their current requirements.\n\n(3) Each natural gas distribution company shall utilize the collaborative process established pursuant to subsection (f) to address its capacity requirements.\n\n(4) Absent the natural gas supplier or large volume industrial or commercial customer taking or providing such capacity, the natural gas distribution company shall file with and obtain approval from the commission for such contracts necessary to ensure sufficient capacity to meet current and projected customer requirements considering the commitments of natural gas suppliers.\n\n(5) Prior to being displaced by a natural gas supplier's alternate interstate storage or transportation capacity, contracts renewed or entered into by the natural gas distribution company pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the process set forth in subsection (d).\n\n(f) Working group and collaborative process.--In its restructuring proceeding, a natural gas distribution company shall set forth a process to establish a working group of licensed natural gas suppliers having customers on the natural gas distribution company's system and representatives of the residential, commercial and industrial customer classes to:\n\n(1) Meet on a scheduled basis.\n\n(2) Seek resolution of operational and capacity issues related to customer choice.\n\nThe final determination of operational and reliability issues resides with the natural gas distribution company. In addition, the natural gas distribution company shall include in its restructuring filing a collaborative process to address broader issues relating to unbundling, customer choice and deregulation.\n\n(g) Investigation and report to General Assembly.--Five years after the effective date of this chapter, the commission shall initiate an investigation or other appropriate proceeding, in which all interested parties are invited to participate, to determine whether effective competition for natural gas supply services exists on the natural gas distribution companies' systems in this Commonwealth. The commission shall report its findings to the General Assembly. Should the commission conclude that effective competition does not exist, the commission shall reconvene the stakeholders in the natural gas industry in this Commonwealth to explore avenues, including legislative, for encouraging increased competition in this Commonwealth.\n\n(h) Displaced employee program.--The Department of Labor and Industry shall establish and implement a program to assist the natural gas distribution company employees who are displaced by the transition to retail competition precipitated by this chapter. The program shall be designed to assist employees in obtaining employment and shall consist of utilizing the Federal funds available for the purpose of retraining and outplacement services for such employees.\n\n(i) Audit requirement.--Prior to the commencement of the restructuring proceeding of a city natural gas distribution operation, the commission shall provide for an independent management audit of all employees, records, equipment, contracts, assets, liabilities, appropriations and obligations related to a city natural gas distribution operation pursuant to section 516 (relating to audits of certain utilities). The city natural gas distribution operation shall have a 60-day period to submit written comments on the audit report to the commission.\n\nCross References.Section 2204 is referred to in sections 2203, 2206, 2211, 2212 of this title.",

Either party may request that the commission consider the appropriate level of the fee. In doing so, the commission shall consider fees charged by other natural gas distribution companies for similar services. The commission shall either permit the fee to continue as set or shall establish an alternative mechanism to permit full recovery of unrecovered just and reasonable costs from the supplier or the supplier's customers. Nothing in this section shall permit the recovery of such costs from natural gas supply service customers of the natural gas distribution company.\n\n(4) If services are provided by an entity other than the natural gas distribution company, the entity that provided those services shall furnish to the natural gas distribution company billing data sufficient to enable the natural gas distribution company to timely bill retail gas customers.

Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service) and to all universal service obligations.\n\n(c) Natural gas distribution company.--The natural gas distribution company shall deliver natural gas to the extent that it is provided by all natural gas suppliers, or suppliers of last resort, as the case may be, in accordance with the natural gas distribution company's tariff.\n\n(d) Standards of service.--Consistent with the standards set forth in section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities) and applicable orders of the commission, a supplier of last resort under subsection (a)(2)(iii) shall provide sufficient supplies as to quantity, quality, pressure and location to meet the operational reliability requirements of the natural gas distribution company's system, including, but not limited to, a failure of one or more natural gas suppliers to:\n\n(1) supply natural gas to their retail gas customers in conformance with their contractual obligations to such customers; or\n\n(2) satisfy applicable reliability standards and obligations.\n\n(e) Discontinuation of service.--The natural gas distribution company shall continue providing services as the supplier of last resort to all of its customers for all of the natural gas supply services described in subsection (a)(2) unless, at its discretion, it requests and receives commission approval to discontinue providing one or more such supplier of last resort obligation. In approving such a petition, the commission shall also approve another party as the alternative supplier of last resort for each customer or customer group for which the natural gas distribution company no longer provides such natural gas supply services.\n\n(f) Regulations.--The commission shall promulgate regulations setting forth the standards for approving an alternative supplier of last resort consistent with the provisions of this title, including a mechanism to ensure that the rates charged by any alternate supplier of last resort are just and reasonable.\n\n(g) Organized labor.--During the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, approval of an alternative supplier of last resort pursuant to subsection (e) shall not be granted unless the entity designated by the commission to succeed the natural gas distribution company in the provision of service to these customers agrees to recognize relevant union and collective bargaining agreements of the natural gas distribution company then in place.\n\n(h) Petition to become supplier of last resort.--After the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, any party may petition the commission to become the supplier of last resort to some or all customers except for those customers identified in subsection (a)(2)(i).\n\n(i) Notice required prior to market exit.--\n\n(1) A natural gas supplier may not exit the market without providing notice as determined by the commission in the restructuring proceeding of the natural gas distribution company to its customers, the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company.\n\n(2) If firm gas supply contracts with Pennsylvania natural gas producers or storage or transportation capacity contracts used by the natural gas supplier to serve such retail gas customers were either assigned or released to the natural gas supplier or constitute capacity which was acquired by the natural gas supplier as the result of nonrenewal of a storage or transportation capacity contract previously held by the natural gas distribution company, the natural gas supplier shall offer the supplier of last resort or successor natural gas supplier a right of first refusal to utilize such Pennsylvania supply contracts or storage or transportation capacity contracts at its contract cost as long as needed to serve those customers.\n\n(3) If the storage or transportation capacity contracts held by the natural gas supplier were acquired in another manner, and there was not sufficient notice given to the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company, or if there is not alternative storage or transportation capacity available which is operationally sufficient to serve the market the natural gas supplier was serving, then the supplier of last resort shall be provided with a right to use such storage or transportation capacity as designated by the natural gas supplier, at the contract cost, until the supplier of last resort is able to acquire replacement capacity sufficient to serve its customers using reasonable and diligent efforts to do so.\n\n(4) If a dispute arises under this subsection, the aggrieved party may file a complaint with the commission for resolution within 45 days.\n\n(j) Duty involving lost customers.--To the extent that a natural gas supplier loses retail gas customers such that its capacity requirements to a natural gas distribution company are reduced below the level established by the commission for such purpose in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, the natural gas supplier shall have the same obligations set forth in subsection (i).\n\n(k) Rate after service discontinued.--In the event the natural gas supplier discontinues service or defaults before its contract with the customer expires, the retail gas customer shall be served by the supplier of last resort at the commission-approved supplier of last resort rate commencing with the next billing cycle. However, the retail gas customer shall continue to be charged the rate the customer negotiated with the discontinuing or defaulting natural gas supplier for the remainder of the billing cycle. Any difference between the cost incurred by the supplier of last resort and the amount payable by the retail gas customer shall be recovered from the natural gas supplier or from the bond or other security provided by the natural gas supplier without recourse to any retail gas customer not otherwise contractually committed for the difference.\n\nCross References.Section 2207 is referred to in section 2208 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) License requirements.--No entity shall engage in the business of a natural gas supplier unless it holds a license issued by the commission. To the extent that a natural gas distribution company provides natural gas supply service outside of its chartered or certificated territory, it also must hold a license. A license shall not be required for customers who make de minimis incidental sales or resales to themselves, an affiliate or other nonresidential retail gas customers.\n\n(b) License application and issuance.--An application for a natural gas supplier license shall be made to the commission in writing, be verified by oath or affirmation and be in such form and contain such information as the commission may, by rule or order, require. A license shall be issued to any applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the service covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing and able to perform properly the service proposed and to conform to the applicable provisions of this title and the orders and regulations of the commission, including those concerning standards and billing practices, and that the proposed service, to the extent authorized by the license, will be consistent with the public interest. Otherwise, such application shall be denied.\n\n(c) Financial fitness.--\n\n(1) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the natural gas supply service in this Commonwealth, no natural gas supplier license shall be issued or remain in force unless the applicant or holder, as the case may be, complies with all of the following:\n\n(i) Furnishes a bond or other security in a form and amount to ensure the financial responsibility of the natural gas supplier. The criteria each natural gas distribution company shall use to determine the amount and form of such bond or other security shall be set forth in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring filing. In approving the criteria, commission considerations shall include, but not be limited to, the financial impact on the natural gas distribution company or an alternative supplier of last resort of a default or subsequent bankruptcy of a natural gas supplier. The commission shall periodically review the criteria upon petition by any party. The amount and form of the bond or other security may be mutually agreed to between the natural gas distribution company or the alternate supplier of last resort and the natural gas supplier or, failing that, shall be determined by criteria approved by the commission.\n\n(ii) Provides the commission with the address of the participant's principal office in this Commonwealth or the address of the participant's registered agent in this Commonwealth, the latter being the address at which the participant may be served process.\n\n(2) Failure of a natural gas supplier to comply with any provision of this chapter or the rules, regulations, orders or directives of the Department of Revenue or of the commission, including, but not limited to, engaging in anticompetitive behavior, shall be cause for the commission to revoke the license of the natural gas supplier.\n\n(d) Transferability of licenses.--No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without prior commission approval.\n\n(e) Form of regulation of natural gas suppliers.--Except where a natural gas supplier serves as a supplier of last resort, the commission may forbear from extending its regulation of natural gas suppliers beyond licensing, bonding, reliability and consumer services and protections, including all applicable portions of 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service). Subject to the provisions of section 2207 (relating to obligation to serve), nothing in this section shall preclude a natural gas supplier, upon appropriate and reasonable notice to the retail gas customer, supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company, from canceling its contract with any customer for legal cause, subject to the customer's right to have continued service from the supplier of last resort.\n\n(f) Availability of the service of natural gas suppliers.--Prior to licensing any natural gas supplier, the commission shall set forth standards to ensure that all customer classes may choose to purchase natural gas from a natural gas supplier. The commission shall also ensure that natural gas suppliers comply with applicable provisions of 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56.\n\n(g) Open and nondiscriminatory access.--In addition to meeting the license requirements applicable to applicants under subsection (b), a municipal corporation shall, before it is permitted to provide natural gas supply services as a natural gas supplier, demonstrate, and the commission shall determine, that, by the date of the issuance of the license, it will provide other natural gas suppliers open and nondiscriminatory access to its gas distribution system under standards that are comparable to this title, taking into consideration the particular circumstances of the municipal corporation's ownership and/or operation of the gas distribution system.\n\n(h) Annual fees.--The commission may establish, by order or rule, on a reasonable cost basis, fees to be charged for annual activities related to the oversight of natural gas suppliers.\n\n(Oct. 22, 2014, P.L.2545, No.155, eff. 60 days)\n\n2014 Amendment.Act 155 added subsec.

The commission shall neither favor nor disfavor conduct or operations by and between a natural gas distribution company and an affiliated natural gas supplier or a nonaffiliated natural gas supplier.\n\n(c) Contents of standards.--Standards of conduct shall provide for:\n\n(1) No discrimination against or preferential treatment of any natural gas supplier, including an affiliated natural gas supplier.\n\n(2) No disclosure or preferential sharing of any confidential information to or with any individual natural gas supplier.\n\n(3) Adequate rules prohibiting cross-subsidization of an affiliated natural gas supplier by a natural gas distribution company.\n\n(4) Maintenance of separate books and records by the natural gas distribution company and its affiliated natural gas supplier.\n\n(5) Sufficient physical and operational separation, but not including legal divestiture, to accomplish paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4).\n\n(6) An informal dispute resolution procedure.\n\n(7) A system of penalties for noncompliance with the final set of standards of conduct consistent with existing commission regulations.\n\n(d) Limitation.--The standards shall not prohibit the natural gas distribution company and its affiliated natural gas supplier from using or sharing similar corporate names, trademarks, trade dress or service marks.\n\n(e) Initiation of investigations.--Upon complaint or upon its own motion, for good cause shown, the commission shall conduct an investigation of the impact on the proper functioning of a fully competitive retail natural gas market of mergers, consolidations, acquisition or disposition of assets or securities of natural gas suppliers and anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct affecting the retail distribution of natural gas.\n\n(f) Conduct of investigations.--\n\n(1) The commission may require a natural gas supplier to provide information, including documents and testimony, in accordance with the commission's regulations regarding the discovery of information.\n\n(2) Material which the commission determines to be confidential, proprietary or trade secret information provided under this subsection shall not be disclosed to any person not directly employed or retained by the commission to conduct the investigation without the consent of the party providing the information.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the prohibition on disclosure of information in paragraph (2), the commission shall disclose information obtained under this subsection to the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate under an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The commission may disclose the information to appropriate Federal or State law enforcement officials if it determines that the disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent or restrain a violation of Federal or State law and it provides the party that provided the information with reasonable notice and opportunity to prevent or limit disclosure.\n\n(g) Referrals and investigation.--If, as a result of the investigation conducted under this section, the commission has reason to believe that anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, is preventing the retail gas customers from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and effectively competitive retail natural gas market, the commission, pursuant to its regulations, shall:\n\n(1) Refer its findings to the Attorney General, the United States Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\n(2) Subject to subsection (c)(3), disclose any information it has obtained in the course of its investigation to the agency or agencies to which it had made a referral under paragraph (1).\n\n(3) Intervene, as provided and permitted by law or regulation, in any proceedings initiated as a result of a referral made under paragraph (1).\n\n(h) Marketing standards.--As part of each natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, the commission may, in its discretion, develop and apply different standards of conduct to the natural gas distribution company's marketing activities related to natural gas supply services. No such standards shall apply to the natural gas distribution company's marketing division or operations until the commission issues an order in the context of that natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding.\n\n(i) Definition.--Subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (h), for the purposes of this section, the term \"affiliated natural gas supplier\" includes marketing activities related to natural gas supply services by the marketing division or the marketing operation of a natural gas distribution company.",

The amortization shall commence at the time when restructuring orders are issued. The natural gas distribution company may seek recovery of the unamortized balance of such costs in a future rate proceeding, and the commission shall allow recovery of such costs provided that the commission determines that such costs are reasonable and that the resulting rates are just and reasonable.\n\n(c) Deferral of costs.--Costs recoverable under sections 2203(6) (relating to standards for restructuring of natural gas utility industry) and 2206(e) (relating to consumer protections and customer service) in excess of amounts already reflected in a natural gas distribution company's rates, which are incurred between the date of entry of the commission's restructuring order and the earlier of the date on which the commission authorizes commencement of recovery or June 30, 2002, may be deferred for recovery in the future. Such deferrals shall be without interest.\n\n(d) Circumstances for exceptions.--A natural gas distribution company may seek and the commission may approve an exception to the limitations set forth in this section under any of the following circumstances:\n\n(1) The natural gas distribution company meets the requirements for extraordinary relief under section 1308(e) (relating to voluntary changes in rates).\n\n(2) The natural gas distribution company demonstrates that a rate increase is necessary in order to preserve the reliability of the natural gas distribution system.\n\n(3) The natural gas distribution company is subject to significant increases in the rate of Federal taxes or other significant increases in costs resulting from changes in law or regulations that would not allow the natural gas distribution company to earn a fair rate of return.\n\n(e) Interclass and intraclass cost shifts.--Except as provided in section 2212, for the period from the effective date of this chapter until January 1, 2001, interclass or intraclass cost shifts are prohibited. This prohibition against cost shifting may be accomplished by maintaining the cost allocation methodology accepted by the commission for each natural gas distribution company in the company's most recent base rate proceeding.\n\n(f) State tax adjustment surcharge.--The natural gas distribution company, other than a city natural gas distribution operation, shall remain subject to the State tax adjustment surcharge and shall be permitted to adjust its State tax adjustment surcharge mechanism to reflect State tax changes or additions. The natural gas distribution company shall also remain subject to existing riders or surcharges for the collection of nongas transition costs pursuant to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decisions.\n\n(g) Provisions relating to interstate pipelines.--\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if a natural gas distribution company's current base rate revenues reflect the margins realized through the utilization of firm interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to serve the interruptible market when such capacity is not needed to make firm retail deliveries, then the natural gas distribution company shall be permitted to increase base rates and, at the same time, reduce purchased gas cost rates, as described in this chapter.\n\n(2) The natural gas distribution company may propose such a change in treatment, consistent with the following requirements:\n\n(i) Base rates of customers who pay purchased gas cost rates pursuant to section 1307(f) (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) shall be increased by an amount equal to the margin received for service provided to existing interruptible sales and transportation service customers using capacity reflected in rates established under section 1307(f) based upon the revenue for such services for the most recent 12-month period immediately preceding the application.\n\n(ii) Purchased gas cost rates established pursuant to section 1307(f) shall be decreased by an amount equal to the amount by which base rates are increased in subparagraph (i).\n\n(iii) Purchased gas cost rates established pursuant to section 1307(f) shall thereafter be reconciled to reflect the margins realized from interruptible sales and interruptible transportation customers utilizing capacity reflected in rates established under section 1307(f).\n\n(h) Interstate pipeline transportation.--\n\n(1) Except as specifically set forth in this subsection, nothing in this section or section 2204(d) (relating to implementation) shall prevent a natural gas distribution company from recovering costs paid under the terms of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts which are not fully recovered through a release, assignment or transfer of such capacity to another natural gas supplier if such unrecovered costs arise under the terms of a natural gas transportation pilot program approved by the commission for such company on or before February 1, 1999.\n\n(2) Such unrecovered interstate pipeline transportation and capacity costs incurred under such programs through October 31, 2004, may be recovered from a class or classes of customers in accordance with such program provided that the total volumetric charge for such costs does not exceed 1% of the volumetric charge for residential natural gas sales service set forth in the natural gas distribution company's tariff in effect at the time.\n\n(3) With respect to such pilot programs, the commission may determine to extend such programs to include all customers of that company pursuant to the requirements of this chapter, and nothing in this section or section 2204(d) shall prevent unrecovered interstate pipeline and transportation capacity costs incurred through October 31, 2004, under such programs from being recovered in accordance with such programs provided that the total volumetric charge for such costs does not exceed the 1% limit specified in paragraph (2) for pilot programs.",

Chapter 11 shall apply to a city natural gas distribution operation to the extent it seeks to provide natural gas distribution services outside of its corporate or municipal limits. Chapter 19 shall apply to issuances of securities for the benefit of a city natural gas distribution operation by an issuer other than a city to the extent provided in subsection (e) but shall not apply to issuances of securities by a city.\n\n(d) Continuation of tariff.--For purposes of this section, prior tariff means the tariff, rate schedule and riders incorporated into the tariff of a city natural gas distribution operation on the date the commission assumes jurisdiction over such city natural gas distribution operation. A city natural gas distribution operation shall continue to provide natural gas supply and natural gas distribution services to its customers under the prior tariff and the policies or programs existing on the date that the commission assumes jurisdiction over the city natural gas distribution operation until the effective date of the final order entered by the commission approving the restructuring plan and new tariff of the city natural gas distribution operations unless such effective date has been stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, in which event the prior tariff will continue in force until such stay has been dissolved. Where the prior tariff refers to, incorporates or includes a local commission, it shall be interpreted as referring to, incorporating or including the commission. Subject to subsection (s), the commission shall resolve all questions, disputes or conflicts arising under the prior tariff. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent a city natural gas distribution operation from requesting or, if so requested, the commission from approving modifications to the prior tariff at any time prior to the effective date of the final order approving the restructuring plan and new tariff.\n\n(e) Securities of city natural gas distribution operations.--Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, in determining the city natural gas distribution operation's revenue requirement and approving overall rates and charges, the commission shall follow the same ratemaking methodology and requirements that were applicable to the city natural gas distribution operation prior to the assumption of jurisdiction by the commission, and such obligation shall continue until the date on which all approved bonds have been retired, redeemed, advance refunded or otherwise defeased. However, this section shall not prevent the commission from approving changes in the rates payable by any class of ratepayers of the city natural gas distribution operation so long as the revenue requirement and the overall rates and charges are not adversely affected by such changes. Notwithstanding any provision in this title to the contrary, the commission shall permit the city natural gas distribution operation to impose, charge or collect rates or charges as necessary to permit the city or municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) that issued bonds on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation to comply with its covenants to the holders of any approved bonds. Notwithstanding any provision in this title to the contrary, the commission shall not require a city natural gas distribution operation to take action, or omit taking any actions, pursuant to this title if such action or omission would have the effect of causing the interest on tax-exempt bonds issued by a city or municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation to be includable in the gross income of the holders of such bonds for Federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this section, approved bonds shall mean all bonds:\n\n(1) issued by a city on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation under the act of October 18, 1972 (P.L.955, No.234), known as The First Class City Revenue Bond Act, or the act of December 7, 1982 (P.L.827, No.231), known as The City of Philadelphia Municipal Utility Inventory and Receivables Financing Act, that were issued and outstanding on the date the commission assumed jurisdiction over the city natural gas distribution operation;\n\n(2) issued by the city after the date the commission assumed jurisdiction over the city natural gas distribution operation unless the governing body of the city, at the time of approval of the bond issuance, determines that such bonds shall not be approved bonds;\n\n(3) issued by the city or a municipal authority, nonprofit corporation or public corporation formed pursuant to subsection (m) for the purpose of refunding, redeeming, repaying or otherwise defeasing approved bonds; or\n\n(4) issued by a municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) for purposes other than refunding, redeeming, repaying or otherwise defeasing approved bonds unless the commission determines, at the time of the registration of a securities certificate pursuant to section 1903 (relating to registration or rejection of securities certificates), that the bonds should not be approved bonds.\n\nNotwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, a city owning a city natural gas distribution operation may continue to issue bonds on behalf of the city natural gas distribution operation pursuant to The First Class City Revenue Bond Act and under The City of Philadelphia Municipal Utility Inventory and Receivables Financing Act, and any municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) may issue bonds on behalf of the city natural gas distribution operation pursuant to the act of May 2, 1945 (P.L.382, No.164), known as the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945, and as otherwise provided by law. All documents that are required to be submitted to the governing body of the city by The First Class City Revenue Bond Act or The City of Philadelphia Municipal Utility Inventory and Receivables Financing Act or, in the case of an issuance of securities by a municipal authority, the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945 shall also be submitted to the commission for its information. Any issuance of securities by a municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation, other than issuances of bonds for the purpose of refunding, redeeming, repaying or otherwise defeasing approved bonds, shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 19 provided that commission determinations with respect to the registration of a securities certificate under Chapter 19 for the issuance of securities by a municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) shall be determinations with respect to public debt and the commission shall employ its abbreviated securities certificate process to such issuances.\n\n(f) Transfers to city.--The commission shall permit the city natural gas distribution operation to impose, charge or collect rates and charges as necessary to permit the city natural gas distribution operation to transfer or pay to the city that is the owner of the city natural gas distribution operation, on an annual basis, such amount as may be specified from time to time in the applicable ordinances of the city or agreements of the city approved by ordinances. If the amount so specified shall exceed 110% of the amount that was authorized for transfer or payment to the city at the close of the fiscal year of the city ending June 30, 2000, such additional amount shall be subject to review and approval of the commission, which approval shall be given unless such additional amount would not be just and reasonable.\n\n(g) Restructuring and tariff filings.--A city natural gas distribution operation shall file with the commission an initial tariff and a restructuring filing consistent with this chapter, and with any orders, rules or regulations adopted by the commission after the effective date of this chapter no later than July 1, 2002, and, unless the city natural gas operation agrees, no earlier than December 31, 2001, pursuant to a schedule to be determined by the commission in consultation with a city natural gas distribution operation. The commission shall conduct an initial rate proceeding pursuant to its procedures for such filings. Hearings on the tariff and restructuring filings shall be held within the municipal limits of the city in which the city natural gas distribution operation is located to the extent practicable.\n\n(h) Restructuring proceedings.--In the restructuring proceeding of a city natural gas distribution operation, in addition to the requirements of section 2204(c) (relating to implementation):\n\n(1) The city natural gas distribution operation shall file a plan to convert its existing information technology, accounting, billing, collection, gas purchasing and other operating systems and procedures to comply with the requirements applicable to jurisdictional natural gas utilities under this title and the applicable rules, regulations and orders. The commission shall examine the cost and burdens of converting existing systems and procedures of a city natural gas distribution operation to meet the requirements of this title generally applicable to natural gas distribution companies. If requested by the city natural gas distribution operation, the commission shall determine whether the cost of conversion of any system or procedure is prudent in light of the benefits to be obtained. In the event that the commission determines that the costs would not be prudent, it may waive application to the city natural gas distribution operation of any provision of this title or the commission's rules, regulations and orders as appropriate. In the event that the commission determines that such costs should be incurred, the commission shall permit the city natural gas distribution operation to fully recover such costs through a nonbypassable charge imbedded in the distribution rates of the city natural gas distribution operation.\n\n(2) In its restructuring proceeding, a city natural gas distribution operation may propose an automatic adjustment mechanism or mechanisms in lieu of or as a supplement to section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) to adjust rates for fluctuations in gas and nongas costs, including, but not limited to, an automatic adjustment mechanism or mechanisms to recover the costs of providing programs for low-income ratepayers and other assisted ratepayers. The commission may approve or modify the automatic adjustment mechanism or mechanisms proposed by the city natural gas distribution operation, or the commission may approve a section 1307 adjustment for a city natural gas distribution operation. However, the automatic adjustment mechanism, whether section 1307 or any alternative proposed by the city natural gas distribution operation, utilized for city natural gas distribution operations must enable the city or municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) that issued bonds on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation to fully comply at all times with its covenants to the holders of any approved bonds.\n\n(i) Powers of the Consumer Advocate; Small Business Advocate.--The Consumer Advocate shall represent the interests of consumers as a party, or otherwise participate for the purpose of representing an interest of consumers, before the commission in any matter properly before the commission relating to a city natural gas distribution operation.

The Small Business Advocate shall represent the interest of small business consumers as a party, or otherwise participate for the purpose of representing an interest of small business consumers, before the commission in any matter properly before the commission relating to a city natural gas distribution operation. The Small Business Advocate is authorized, in addition to any other authority conferred on him, to represent an interest of small business consumers which is presented to him for his consideration upon petition in writing by a substantial number of small business consumers who make, direct, use or are ultimate recipients of a product or services supplied by a city natural gas distribution operation.\n\n(j) Commencement of customer choice.--Beginning with the commencement of the first fiscal year of a city natural gas distribution operation after the order approving the restructuring plan of a city natural gas distribution operation becomes effective, all retail gas customers of city natural gas distribution operations shall have the opportunity to purchase natural gas supply services from a natural gas supplier or the city natural gas distribution operation to the extent it offers the service. After that date, the choice of natural gas suppliers shall rest with the retail gas customer.\n\n(k) City instrumentality.--Unless and until the governing body of a city that owns a city natural gas distribution operation otherwise provides:\n\n(1) a city natural gas distribution operation shall be deemed an instrumentality of the city that owns it and independently authorized to establish and maintain pension, welfare and other employee benefit plans for the benefit of those individuals who render services in connection with its operations; and\n\n(2) for the purpose of being a participant in such plans or programs, those individuals who render services exclusively and directly related to the operations of the city natural gas distribution operation shall be deemed employees of the city natural gas distribution operation as a distinct entity from the city. If any pension plan established and maintained by or on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation is or becomes subject to the act of December 18, 1984 (P.L.1005, No.205), known as the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act, the provisions of Chapters 5 and 6 of that act (relating to financially distressed municipal pension system recovery programs) shall not require any pension plan of a city natural gas distribution operation to be aggregated with any pension plan established and maintained by the city.\n\n(l) Assisted cities.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, no assisted city shall be required to take any action under this title if the effect of the action is to cause a variation in the financial plan of such assisted city approved pursuant to section 209 of the act of June 5, 1991 (P.L.9, No.6), known as the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority Act for Cities of the First Class.

Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c), if a city forms an entity pursuant to this section to provide natural gas supply services, whether inside or outside of the city, the entity shall be deemed an affiliated interest of the city natural gas distribution operation, and Chapter 21 shall apply with respect to that affiliated interest. A municipal authority formed pursuant to the authorization of this section shall not exercise the power of eminent domain outside of the municipal limits of the city in which it is seated.

Subject to the requirement that it qualify for and obtain a natural gas supplier's license under section 2208, a city natural gas distribution operation is authorized to engage in the business of a natural gas supplier outside its municipal or corporate limits.\n\n(q) Commission assessment.--In order to ensure that the commission will be able to carry out its obligations with respect to city natural gas operations, the chief executive officer of a city natural gas distribution operation shall file, no later than March 31, 2000, a sworn statement showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the immediately preceding fiscal year in the same manner as required by section 510(b) (relating to assessment for regulatory expenses upon public utilities). The commission shall use such revenues in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 510(b) and shall bill, no earlier than July 1, 2000, each city natural gas distribution operation its proportional share of the commission's expenses pursuant to section 510(b)(4). A city natural gas distribution operation shall pay the resulting assessment in accordance with and subject to the provisions contained in section 510.\n\n(r) Senior citizens.--\n\n(1) The commission may approve a program designed to provide discounted rates for natural gas distribution and supply services to senior citizens residing in the service territory of a city natural gas distribution operation provided that such rates and the terms of such program are just and reasonable.\n\n(2) Individual ratepayers who, as of the date the initial tariff of a city natural gas distribution operation becomes effective pursuant to subsection (d), are properly receiving discounted gas rates pursuant to the terms of a program specifically designed to provide assistance to senior citizens contained in the prior tariff shall be entitled to continue to receive such discount under the terms of the prior tariff unless and until the program is modified by ordinance of the governing body of the city, in which event such individuals shall be entitled to receive only the discount provided under the terms of the modified program, as it may be further modified by ordinance from time to time thereafter.\n\n(3) Nothing in this title shall require the commission to approve the continuation of the program identified in paragraph (2) in whole or part for any person other than an individual identified in paragraph (2).\n\n(s) Powers preserved.--Nothing contained in this title shall be construed to abrogate or limit the executive or legislative powers of a city that owns a city natural gas distribution operation to legislate or otherwise determine the powers, functions, budgets, activities and mission of the city natural gas distribution operation or any related entity created under subsection (m), including, but not limited to, the ownership, governance, management or control thereof. Nothing in this title shall limit or prevent the proper city officials and agencies from conducting audits and examinations of the financial affairs of the city natural gas distribution operation in accordance with their official duties.\n\n(t) Proprietary information.--Proprietary information, trade secrets and competitively sensitive information of a city natural gas distribution operation shall not be public records for purposes of the act of June 21, 1957 (P.L.390, No.212), referred to as the Right-to-Know Law, and shall not be subject to mandatory public disclosure.
