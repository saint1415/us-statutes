      "text": "(a) Determination of assessment.--Before November 1 of each year, the commission shall estimate its total expenditures in the administration of this part for the fiscal year beginning July of the following year, which estimate shall not exceed three-tenths of 1% of the total gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utilities and licensed entities under its jurisdiction for the preceding calendar year, except that the estimate may exceed this amount to reflect Federal funds received by the commission and funds received from other sources to perform functions that are unrelated to the regulation of public utilities and licensed entities. Such estimate shall be submitted to the Governor in accordance with section 610 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929. At the same time the commission submits its estimate to the Governor, the commission shall also submit that estimate to the General Assembly. The commission or its designated representatives shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Governor and the Senate and House Appropriations Committees regarding their estimates. The commission shall subtract from the final estimate:\n\n(1) The estimated fees to be collected pursuant to section 317 (relating to fees for services rendered by commission) during such fiscal year.\n\n(2) The estimated balance of the appropriation, specified in section 511 (relating to disposition, appropriation and disbursement of assessments and fees), to be carried over into such fiscal year from the preceding one.\n\nThe remainder so determined, herein called the total assessment, shall be allocated to, and paid by, such public utilities in the manner prescribed. If the General Assembly fails to approve the commission's budget for the purposes of this part, by March 30, the commission shall assess public utilities on the basis of the last approved operating budget. At such time as the General Assembly approves the proposed budget the commission shall have the authority to make an adjustment in the assessments to reflect the approved budget. If, subsequent to the approval of the budget, the commission determines that a supplemental budget may be needed, the commission shall submit its request for that supplemental budget simultaneously to the Governor and the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.\n\n(b) Allocation of assessment.--On or before March 31 of each year, every public utility shall file with the commission a statement under oath showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the preceding calendar year. If any public utility shall fail to file such statement on or before March 31, the commission shall estimate such revenues, which estimate shall be binding upon the public utility for the purposes of this section. For each fiscal year, the allocation shall be made as follows:\n\n(1) The commission shall determine for the preceding calendar year the amount of its expenditures directly attributable to the regulation of each group of utilities furnishing the same kind of service, and debit the amount so determined to such group. The commission may, for purposes of the assessment, deem utilities rendering water, sewer or water and sewer service, as defined in the definition of \"public utility\" in section 102 (relating to definitions), as a utility group.\n\n(2) The commission shall also determine for the preceding calendar year the balance of its expenditures, not debited as aforesaid, and allocate such balance to each group in the proportion which the gross intrastate operating revenues of such group for that year bear to the gross intrastate operating revenues of all groups for that year.\n\n(3) The commission shall then allocate the total assessment prescribed by subsection (a) to each group in the proportion which the sum of the debits made to it bears to the sum of the debits made to all groups.\n\n(4) Each public utility within a group shall then be assessed for and shall pay to the commission such proportion of the amount allocated to its group as the gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utility for the preceding calendar year bear to the total gross intrastate operating revenues of its group for that year.\n\n(5) (Repealed).\n\n(c) Notice, hearing and payment.--The commission shall give notice by registered or certified mail to each public utility of the amount lawfully charged against it under the provisions of this section, which amount shall be paid by the public utility within 30 days of receipt of such notice, unless the commission specifies on the notices sent to all public utilities an installment plan of payment, in which case each public utility shall pay each installment on or before the date specified therefor by the commission. Within 15 days after receipt of such notice, the public utility against which such assessment has been made may file with the commission objections setting out in detail the grounds upon which the objector regards such assessment to be excessive, erroneous, unlawful or invalid. The commission, after notice to the objector, shall hold a hearing upon such objections. After such hearing, the commission shall record upon its minutes its findings on the objections and shall transmit to the objector, by registered or certified mail, notice of the amount, if any, charged against it in accordance with such findings, which amount or any installment thereof then due, shall be paid by the objector within ten days after receipt of notice of the findings of the commission with respect to such objections. If any payment prescribed by this subsection is not made as aforesaid, the commission may suspend or revoke certificates of public convenience, certify automobile registrations to the Department of Transportation for suspension or revocation or, through the Department of Justice, may institute an appropriate action at law for the amount lawfully assessed, together with any additional cost incurred by the commission or the Department of Justice by virtue of such failure to pay.\n\n(d) Suits by public utilities.--No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the purpose of restraining or in anywise delaying the collection or payment of any assessment made under subsections (a), (b) and (c), but every public utility against which an assessment is made shall pay the same as provided in subsection (c). Any public utility making any such payment may, at any time within two years from the date of payment, sue the Commonwealth in an action at law to recover the amount paid, or any part thereof, upon the ground that the assessment was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, in whole or in part, provided objections, as hereinbefore provided, were filed with the commission, and payment of the assessment was made under protest either as to all or part thereof. In any action for recovery of any payments made under this section, the claimant shall be entitled to raise every relevant issue of law, but the findings of fact made by the commission, pursuant to this section, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. Any records, books, data, documents, and memoranda relating to the expenses of the commission shall be admissible in evidence in any court and shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of their contents. If it is finally determined in any such action that all or any part of the assessment for which payment was made under protest was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, the commission shall make a refund to the claimant out of the appropriation specified in section 511 as directed by the court.\n\n(e) Certain provisions not applicable.--The provisions of this part relating to the judicial review of orders and determinations of the commission shall not be applicable to any findings, determinations, or assessments made under this section. The procedure in this section providing for the determination of the lawfulness of assessments and the recovery back of payments made pursuant to such assessment shall be exclusive of all other remedies and procedures.\n\n(f) Intent of section.--It is the intent and purpose of this section that each public utility subject to this part shall advance to the commission its reasonable share of the cost of administering this part. The commission shall keep records of the costs incurred in connection with the administration and enforcement of this part or any other statute. The commission shall also keep a record of the manner in which it shall have computed the amount assessed against every public utility. Such records shall be open to inspection by all interested parties. The determination of such costs and assessments by the commission, and the records and data upon which the same are made, shall be considered prima facie correct; and in any proceeding instituted to challenge the reasonableness or correctness of any assessment under this section, the party challenging the same shall have the burden of proof.\n\n(g) Saving provision.--This section does not affect or repeal any of the provisions of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), known as the \"Commonwealth Documents Law.\"\n\n(Dec. 18, 1980, P.L.1247, No.226, eff. imd.; July 10, 1986, P.L.1238, No.114, eff. imd.; Apr. 4, 1990, P.L.93, No.21, eff. 90 days; June 22, 1990, P.L.241, No.56, eff. 60 days; Dec. 30, 2002, P.L.2001, No.230, eff. 60 days; July 16, 2004, P.L.758, No.94; Oct. 22, 2014, P.L.2545, No.155, eff. 60 days)\n\n2014 Amendment.Act 155 amended subsec.

      "text": "(a) General rule.--The commission shall provide for audits of any electric, gas, telephone or water utility whose plant in service is valued at not less than $10,000,000. The audits shall include an examination of management effectiveness and operating efficiency. The commission shall establish procedures for audits of the operations of utilities as provided in this section. Audits shall be conducted at least once every five years unless the commission finds that a specific audit is unnecessary, but in no event shall audits be conducted less than once every eight years. A summary of the audits mandated by this subsection shall be released to the public, and a complete copy of the audits shall be provided to the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate.\n\n(b) Management efficiency investigations.--In addition to the audits mandated by subsection (a), the commission shall appoint a management efficiency investigator who shall periodically examine the management effectiveness and operating efficiency of all utilities required to be audited under subsection (a) and monitor the utility company responses to the audits required by subsection (a). For the purposes of carrying out the periodic audit required by this subsection and for carrying out the monitoring of audits required by subsection (a), the commission is hereby empowered to direct the management efficiency investigator to conduct such investigations through and with teams made up of commission staff and/or independent consulting firms; further, the commission may designate specific items of management effectiveness and operating efficiency to be investigated. The management efficiency investigator shall provide an annual report to the commission, the affected utility, the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate detailing the findings of such investigations.\n\n(c) Use of independent auditing firms.--The commission may require an audit under subsection (a) or (b) to be performed by an independent consulting firm. When the commission, under either subsection (a) or (b), orders an audit to be performed by an independent consulting firm, the commission, after consultation with the utility, shall select the firm and require the utility to enter into a contract with the firm providing for payment of the firm by the utility. The terms of the contract shall include all reasonable expenses directly related to the performance of the audit or to the management efficiency investigation activities of independent consulting firms at the utility, as well as their preparation and presentation of testimony in any contested litigation which may be undertaken as a result of the audit findings under subsection (a) or (b). That contract shall require the audit firm to work under the direction of the commission.\n\n(d) Other powers of commission unaffected.--This section is not intended to alter or repeal any existing powers of the commission.\n\n(Dec. 21, 1984, P.L.1240, No.234, eff. 60 days; July 10, 1986, P.L.1238, No.114, eff. imd.)\n\nCross References.Section 516 is referred to in sections 523, 2204 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Legislative findings.--The General Assembly hereby finds as follows:\n\n(1) Potential qualifying facilities which would generate electricity from United States energy sources are, and will for the foreseeable future continue to be, able to supplement adequately the capacity needs of public utilities in this Commonwealth.\n\n(2) Some of those qualifying facilities offer the multiple benefits of supplying electricity to Pennsylvania ratepayers at a reasonable price, creating jobs in areas of high unemployment in this Commonwealth and helping to clean up this Commonwealth's environment.\n\n(3) Although Federal law places a duty on public utilities to buy electricity generated by qualifying facilities, Federal law does not dictate how the price paid by public utilities and the charges to ratepayers for that electricity are to be calculated.\n\n(4) The energy source used by a qualifying facility is a significant factor in determining if a qualifying facility would be able to meet its commitment to supply electricity to a public utility at a reasonable price.\n\n(5) Coal mined in a foreign country is subject to major supply interruptions, price increases and quality reductions which are unpredictable and which may result not only from market factors, but also from foreign policy decisions of the United States Government or one or more foreign governments or from domestic policy changes in the foreign country in which the coal is mined.\n\n(6) It is much easier for a public utility and the commission to predict the reliability of a qualifying facility and the reasonableness of the price of the electricity to be supplied by that qualifying facility if United States energy sources are to be used than if coal mined in a foreign country is to be used.\n\n(7) A qualifying facility which would burn coal mined in a foreign country is too potentially unreliable to justify a public utility in foregoing alternative capacity commitments and in paying the qualifying facility a price which includes any capacity credit.\n\n(b) General rule.--The price paid by a public utility to a qualifying facility and the charge imposed on the utility's ratepayers for electricity generated by that qualifying facility shall not include any capacity credit if that qualifying facility burns coal mined in a foreign country.\n\n(c) Restriction on contract approval.--The commission shall not approve any contract between a public utility and a qualifying facility which burns coal mined in a foreign country for the purchase by the utility of electricity generated by the qualifying facility unless:\n\n(1) the price to be paid by the utility reflects no more than the actual avoided cost of the utility when the payment is made; and\n\n(2) the contract does not exceed five years in duration.\n\n(d) Review of contracts.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a contract in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter between a public utility and a qualifying facility for the purchase by the utility of electricity generated by the qualifying facility shall, after notice and hearing, be subject to review and modification in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) at any time upon complaint or upon the commission's own motion if the qualifying facility burns coal mined in a foreign country.\n\n(e) Recovery from ratepayers.--For the express purpose of implementing the intent of this section, a public utility shall not be permitted to recover from ratepayers pursuant to section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) any of the costs associated with a contract between the utility and a qualifying facility which burns coal mined in a foreign country for the purchase by the utility of electricity generated by the qualifying facility. Any such costs which the commission determines to be reasonable and prudent shall be recoverable only through a base rate proceeding pursuant to Chapter 13 (relating to rates and rate making).\n\n(f) Definition.--For the purposes of this section, \"qualifying facility\" means any cogeneration facility or small power producer which is a qualifying facility pursuant to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's guidelines set forth at 18 CFR §§ 292.101(b)(1) (relating to definitions) and 292.203(a) and (b) (relating to general requirements for qualification).\n\n(g) Severability.--The provisions of this section shall be severable. If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any public utility, qualifying facility or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this section and the application of any provision thereof to any other public utilities, qualifying facilities or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\n(July 6, 1988, P.L.490, No.83, eff. imd.)\n\n1988 Amendment.Act 83 added section 528.",

Such order shall provide for the extension of the service area of the acquiring capable public utility.\n\n(e) Acquisition price.--The price for the acquisition of the small water or sewer utility shall be determined by agreement between the small water or sewer utility and the acquiring capable public utility, subject to a determination by the commission that the price is reasonable. If the small water or sewer utility and the acquiring capable public utility are unable to agree on the acquisition price or the commission disapproves the acquisition price on which the utilities have agreed, the commission shall issue an order directing the acquiring capable public utility to acquire the small water or sewer utility by following the procedure prescribed for exercising the power of eminent domain pursuant to the act of June 22, 1964 (Sp.Sess., P.L.84, No.6), known as the Eminent Domain Code.\n\n(f) Separate tariffs.--The commission may, in its discretion and for a reasonable period of time after the date of acquisition, allow the acquiring capable public utility to charge and collect rates from the customers of the acquired small water or sewer utility pursuant to a separate tariff.\n\n(g) Appointment of receiver.--The commission may, in its discretion, appoint a receiver to protect the interests of the customers of the small water or sewer utility. Any such appointment shall be by order of the commission, which order shall specify the duties and responsibilities of the receiver.\n\n(h) Notice.--The notice required by subsection (a) or any other provision of this section shall be served upon the small water or sewer utility affected, the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate, the Office of Trial Staff, the Department of Environmental Resources, all proximate public utilities providing the same type of service as the small water or sewer utility, all proximate municipalities and municipal authorities providing the same type of service as the small water or sewer utility and the municipalities served by the small water or sewer utility. The commission shall order the affected small water or sewer utility to provide notice to its customers of the initiation of proceedings under this section in the same manner in which the utility is required to notify its customers of proposed general rate increases.\n\n(i) Burden of proof.--The Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement shall have the burden of establishing a prima facie case that the acquisition of the small water or sewer utility would be in the public interest and in compliance with the provisions of this section. Once the commission determines that a prima facie case has been established:\n\n(1) the small water or sewer utility shall have the burden of proving its ability to render adequate, efficient, safe and reasonable service at just and reasonable rates; and\n\n(2) a proximate public utility providing the same type of service as the small water or sewer utility shall have the opportunity and burden of proving its financial, managerial or technical inability to acquire and operate the small water or sewer utility.\n\n(j) Plan for improvements.--Any capable public utility ordered by the commission to acquire a small water or sewer utility shall, prior to acquisition, submit to the commission for approval a plan, including a timetable, for bringing the small water or sewer utility into compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards. The capable public utility shall also provide a copy of the plan to the Department of Environmental Resources and such other State or local agency as the commission may direct. The commission shall give the Department of Environmental Resources adequate opportunity to comment on the plan and shall consider any comments submitted by the department in deciding whether or not to approve the plan. The reasonably and prudently incurred costs of each improvement shall be recoverable in rates only after that improvement becomes used and useful in the public service.\n\n(k) Limitations on liability.--Upon approval by the commission of a plan for improvements submitted pursuant to subsection (j) and the acquisition of a small water or sewer utility by a capable public utility, the acquiring capable public utility shall not be liable for any damages beyond the aggregate amount of $50,000, including a maximum amount of $5,000 per incident, if the cause of those damages is proximately related to identified violations of applicable statutes or regulations by the small water or sewer utility. This subsection shall not apply:\n\n(1) beyond the end of the timetable in the plan for improvements;\n\n(2) whenever the acquiring capable public utility is not in compliance with the plan for improvements; or\n\n(3) if, within 60 days of having received notice of the proposed plan for improvements, the Department of Environmental Resources submitted written objections to the commission and those objections have not subsequently been withdrawn.\n\n(l) Limitations on enforcement actions.--Upon approval by the commission of a plan for improvements submitted pursuant to subsection (j) and the acquisition of a small water or sewer utility by a capable public utility, the acquiring capable public utility shall not be subject to any enforcement actions by State or local agencies which had notice of the plan if the basis of such enforcement action is proximately related to identified violations of applicable statutes or regulations by the small water or sewer utility. This subsection shall not apply:\n\n(1) beyond the end of the timetable in the plan for improvements;\n\n(2) whenever the acquiring capable public utility is not in compliance with the plan for improvements;\n\n(3) if, within 60 days of having received notice of the proposed plan for improvements, the Department of Environmental Resources submitted written objections to the commission and those objections have not subsequently been withdrawn; or\n\n(4) to emergency interim actions of the commission or the Department of Environmental Resources, including, but not limited to, the ordering of boil-water advisories or other water supply warnings, of emergency treatment or of temporary, alternate supplies of water.\n\n(m) Definitions.--As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection:\n\n\"Capable public utility.\"A public utility which regularly provides the same type of service as the small water utility or the small sewer utility to 4,000 or more customer connections, which is not an affiliated interest of the small water utility or the small sewer utility and which provides adequate, efficient, safe and reasonable service.
