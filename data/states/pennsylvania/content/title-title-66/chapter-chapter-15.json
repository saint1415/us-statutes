If within seven days of delivery or mailing of the notice to the landlord issued pursuant to this section the landlord ratepayer files a complaint with the commission disputing the right of the utility to terminate service, the notice shall not be rendered until the complaint has been adjudicated by the commission, but the landlord ratepayer shall continue to pay the undisputed portion of current bills when due pending the final decision of the complaint.\n\n(b) Voluntary relinquishment of service.--Before any discontinuance of service by a public utility to a landlord ratepayer due to a request for voluntary relinquishment of service by the landlord ratepayer:\n\n(1) the landlord ratepayer shall state in a form bearing his notarized signature that all of the affected dwelling units are either unoccupied or the tenants affected by the proposed discontinuance have consented in writing to the proposed discontinuance, which form shall conspicuously bear a notice that the information provided by the landlord ratepayer will be relied upon by the commission in administering a system of uniform service standards for public utilities, and that false statements are punishable criminally;\n\n(2) all of the tenants affected by the proposed discontinuance shall inform the utility orally or in writing of their consent to the discontinuance; or\n\n(3) the landlord ratepayer shall provide the utility with the names and addresses of the affected tenants pursuant to section 1524 (relating to request to landlord to identify tenants) and the utility shall notify the community service agencies and each dwelling unit pursuant to this section and section 1526.\n\n(c) Rights of tenants.--Under the voluntary relinquishment discontinuance procedures of subsection (b)(3) the tenants shall have all of the rights provided in section 1527 (relating to right of tenants to continued service) through section 1531 (relating to retaliation by landlord prohibited).\n\n(July 2, 1993, P.L.379, No.54, eff. 60 days)\n\n1993 Amendment.Act 54 amended the section heading and subsec.

      "text": "(a) General rule.--The notice required to be given to a tenant pursuant to section 1523 (relating to notices before service to landlord terminated) shall be sent by first class mail or otherwise hand-delivered to each affected tenant by name at his individual dwelling unit, or by unit number or unit designation, and shall be posted in common areas.\n\n(1) In the case when a utility does not send notice by first class mail, notice shall be hand-delivered. Hand-delivery shall mean two attempts at personal service on a responsible individual residing within the dwelling unit on the same or separate days. Each attempt at personal service must be made as follows:\n\n(i) One attempt shall be made between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on any day Monday through Friday.\n\n(ii) The other attempt shall be made either between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on any day Monday through Friday or between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on a Saturday or Sunday.\n\nEach of these attempts must be made not less than four hours apart. If no personal service is made on any occasion, the notice must be posted on the individual dwelling unit and inserted under the door if floor space allows.\n\n(2) In the case where the utility cannot gain access to a residential building to comply with paragraph (1), the utility shall apply to court to obtain the names and send notice by first class mail to the affected tenant.\n\nIn order to obtain the names and addresses of the affected tenants and in conjunction with section 1524 (relating to request to landlord to identify tenants), the utility representative shall visit the affected premises within seven days of service of notice to the landlord ratepayer, under section 1525 (relating to delivery and contents of termination notice to landlord), and, by personally contacting one or more of the affected tenants, shall attempt to obtain the names of all the tenants residing in the affected premises. The notice for each affected tenant for whom a name has been obtained shall be sent by first class mail or otherwise hand-delivered to each affected tenant by name at his individual dwelling unit by address and by unit number or, if none exists, by unit designation and shall also be conspicuously posted in the common areas. The notice for each affected tenant for whom a name has not been obtained shall be hand-delivered to each individual dwelling unit by address and unit number or, if none exists, by unit designation and shall be conspicuously posted in the common areas. For the purposes of this section, the term \"unit designation\" means the geographic location of a dwelling unit by floor and floor area. All notices shall contain the following information:\n\n(1) The date on which the notice is rendered.\n\n(2) The date on or after which service will be discontinued.\n\n(3) On each account, the bill for the billing month preceding the notice to the tenants except that, in the case of water and sewer service where the billing period is bimonthly or quarterly, the utility shall provide an estimate of costs for the previous 30-day period. Estimates shall be based upon actual usage or, if actual usage is not available, by determining one-twelfth of the dwelling unit's annual usage.\n\n(4) The following statement of the tenant's rights, the words and phrases of which appear all in capital letters to be printed in 12-point bold-faced type with the first letter printed in upper case and the letters that follow in lower case and the words and phrases which do not appear all in capital letters to be printed in ten-point type, with any letter in upper case to remain so and the rest in lower case:\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO TENANTS\n\nWARNING: YOUR (utility company shall insert company name and type of service) MAY BE SHUT OFF ON OR AFTER (date) BECAUSE (utility shall fill in reason for termination). TO STOP THE SHUTOFF OF YOUR UTILITY SERVICE, YOU MUST DO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS:\n\n1. You can join with the other tenants to pay the utility bill for the last 30 days preceding this notice or you can pay the total bill yourself. Either way, you do not have to pay a deposit or get credit granted in your name. You will not have to pay your landlord's other debts or the debts of prior tenants, and the utility service will remain in the name of the landlord.\n\n2. You may deduct your payment to the utility company from your rent due now or from future rent. The utility company will tell your landlord how much you paid for that utility service.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n1. The bill which must be paid to continue service is $(amount).\n\n2. Your landlord cannot punish you if you pay the utility bill. Your landlord cannot raise your rent, cannot evict you and cannot take action against you in any other way for paying the utility bill and deducting it from rent. You have a right to recover money damages from the landlord for any damages or injury he causes you for exercising your rights as a result of this notice.\n\n3. You have the right to dispute the accuracy of the bill and have certain other rights. If you would like further information regarding these rights, contact your utility at (utility shall fill in a phone number and address where the tenant may get further information).\n\nDO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?\n\nIf you have any questions about your utility service, please contact the utility company at (telephone number and address). If, after talking about your problems with the utility, you are not satisfied, then call the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission at its toll-free number, which is 1-800-692-7380, or write the Residential Termination Unit, Bureau of Consumer Services, Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, P.O. Box 3265, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17120. YOU SHOULD CALL OR WRITE BEFORE THE SHUTOFF. TO AVOID SHUTOFF, YOUR LETTER MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE SHUTOFF DATE.\n\nThe words and phrases of the foregoing notice to tenants are subject to revisions due to changes in the rules, regulations and laws governing this subchapter.\n\n(5) That the tenant or tenants must make payment to the utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer by check or money order drawn by the tenant to the order of the utility or by cash and that the tenant must provide, upon request, reasonable identification to the utility.

However, the presumption shall not arise if the notice of termination of tenancy is for nonpayment of rent not withheld under section 1529 or lawfully withheld under any other right that the tenant may have by law.\n\n(July 2, 1993, P.L.379, No.54, eff. 60 days)\n\n1993 Amendment.Act 54 amended subsec.

      "text": "(a) Application for continued service.--At any time before or after service is terminated by a public utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer, the affected tenants may apply to the utility to have service continued or resumed.\n\n(b) Payment of charges by tenants.--A public utility shall not terminate service or shall promptly resume service previously terminated if it receives from the tenants an amount equal to the bill for the affected account of the landlord ratepayer for the billing month preceding the notice to the tenants. Thereafter, the utility shall notify each tenant of the total amount of the bill for the second and each succeeding billing month and, if the tenants fail to make payment of any bill within 30 days of the delivery of the notice to the tenants, the utility may commence termination of service, except that no termination may occur until 30 days after each tenant has been furnished notice of the proposed termination as prescribed in section 1528 (relating to delivery and contents of subsequent termination notice to tenants). The tenant or tenants shall make payment to the utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer by check or money order drawn by the tenant to the order of the utility or by cash. In all cases, the tenant shall provide, upon request, reasonable identification to the utility. For the purposes of this section, \"reasonable identification\" shall include, but not be limited to, a driver's license, photo identification, medical assistance or food stamp identification or any similar document issued by any public agency which contains the name and address of the tenant.\n\n(c) Disposition of payment by utility.--Upon receiving any payment, the utility shall notify the landlord ratepayer who is liable for the utility service of the amount or amounts paid by any tenant and the amount or amounts credited to the landlord's bill for each tenant pursuant to this section. Tenants requesting continued utility service under this section, except those individually subscribing for service under subsection (d), shall not be considered utility customers but shall be considered to be acting on behalf of the landlord ratepayer, who shall remain liable to the utility for service provided after notice to tenants. In the event that the tenants fail to satisfy the requirements of subsection (b) with regard to the first billing month period preceding notice to the tenant, the utility shall refund any moneys received from a tenant to that tenant. Any payments made by the tenants shall be applied first against the bill for the billing month preceding notice to the tenants and then against bills for service rendered subsequent to the bill. Upon termination of service to the tenants for failure to pay the utility bill for service in full for any subsequent month or upon voluntary discontinuance of service at the request of the tenants, the utility shall immediately refund to the tenants any amounts paid to the utility for the billing period for which payment in full was not remitted.\n\n(d) Agreement for individual service.--Any tenant of a residential building or mobile home park who has been notified of a proposed discontinuance of utility service pursuant to section 1523 (relating to notices before service to landlord discontinued) shall have the right to agree to subscribe for future service individually if this can be accomplished without a major revision of distribution facilities or additional right-of-way acquisitions.\n\n(July 2, 1993, P.L.379, No.54, eff. 60 days)\n\n1993 Amendment.Act 54 amended subsecs.
