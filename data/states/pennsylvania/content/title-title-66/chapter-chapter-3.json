Confirmation of such gubernatorial appointees shall be by a majority of the members of the Senate. If other vacancies occur between the effective date of this amendatory act and April 1, 1987, the term shall be the balance of the term to which the predecessor had been appointed. Vacancies after April 1, 1987, shall be filled for the balance of the term to which a predecessor had been appointed. Thereafter, the commission shall consist of five members appointed by the Governor, by and with the advice and consent of a majority of the members of the Senate, for a term of five years. The Governor may submit the nomination to the Senate within 60 days prior to the expiration of the term or the effective date of the resignation of the member whom the nominee would replace and shall submit that nomination no later than 90 days after the expiration of the term or the effective date of the resignation.

Commencing July 1, 1977, commissioners shall devote full time to their official duties.

As used in this part, blind trust means a trust over which neither the commissioners, their spouses, nor any minor or unemancipated children shall exercise any managerial control, and from which neither the commissioners, their spouses, nor any minor or unemancipated children shall receive any income from the trust during the commissioner's tenure of office. Such disclosure statement shall be filed with the secretary of the commission and shall be open to inspection by the public during the normal business hours of the commission during the tenure of the commissioner. Every commissioner, and every individual or official, employed or appointed to office under, in the service of, or in connection with, the work of the commission, is forbidden, directly or indirectly, to solicit or request from, or to suggest or recommend to any public utility, or to any officer, attorney, agent or employee thereof, the appointment of any individual to any office, place or position in, or the employment of any individual in any capacity by, such public utility.

The commissioners shall annually elect a member to serve as the vice chairman of the commission. When present, the chairman shall preside at all meetings, but in his absence the vice chairman or, in his absence, a member, designated by the chairman, shall preside and shall exercise, for the time being, all the powers of the chairman. The chairman shall have such powers and duties as authorized by the commission as provided in section 331(b) (relating to powers of commission and administrative law judges).\n\n(d) Quorum.--A majority of the members of the commission serving in accordance with law shall constitute a quorum and such majority, acting unanimously, shall be required for any action, including the making of any order or the ratification of any act done or order made by one or more of the commissioners. No vacancy in the commission shall impair the right of a quorum of the commissioners to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the commission.\n\n(e) Compensation.--Each of the commissioners shall receive an annual salary of $55,000, except the chairman, who shall receive an annual salary of $57,500.\n\n(f) Open proceedings.--The proceedings of the commission shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the act of July 19, 1974 (P.L.486, No.175), referred to as the Public Agency Open Meeting Law.\n\n(g) Monitoring cases.--Each commissioner shall be responsible for monitoring specified cases as shall be assigned to him in a manner determined by the commission.

      "text": "(a) General rule.--The commission may, on its own motion and whenever it may be necessary in the performance of its duties, investigate and examine the condition and management of any public utility or any other person or corporation subject to this part. In conducting the investigations the commission may proceed, either with or without a hearing, as it may deem best, but it shall make no order without affording the parties affected thereby a hearing. Any investigation, inquiry or hearing which the commission has power to undertake or hold shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(b) Assignment of proceedings; powers of chairman.--All on-the-record proceedings shall be referred to an administrative law judge for decision except that in those proceedings involving a rate determination, safety matters, rulemaking procedures, unprotested applications or matters covered by section 335(a)(1) (relating to initial decisions), the commission may authorize the chairman to assign cases as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3); and, in addition, the commission may authorize the chairman to:\n\n(1) Designate the time and place for the conducting of investigations, inquiries and hearings.\n\n(2) Assign cases to a commissioner or commissioners for hearing, investigation, inquiry, study or other similar purposes.\n\n(3) Assign cases to special agents or administrative law judges for the taking and receiving of evidence.\n\n(4) Direct and designate officers and employees of the commission to make investigations, inspections, inquiries, studies and other like assignments for reports to the commission.\n\n(5) Be responsible through the secretary for specifically enumerated daily administrative operations of the commission.\n\n(c) Requirements for presiding officers.--There shall preside at the taking of evidence the commission, one or more commissioners, or one or more administrative law judges appointed as provided in this chapter. The functions of all presiding officers shall be conducted in an impartial manner. Any such officer may at any time withdraw from a proceeding if he deems himself disqualified, and, upon the filing in good faith of a timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of any such officer, the commission shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the proceeding.\n\n(d) Authority of presiding officers.--In addition to any administrative rules of procedure contained in this part, the commission may adopt and publish such additional rules of procedure as are not inconsistent with this part. Officers presiding at hearings shall have authority subject to the published rules of the commission and within its powers, to:\n\n(1) Administer oaths and affirmations.\n\n(2) Issue subpoenas authorized by law.\n\n(3) Rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence, take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of justice would be served thereby.\n\n(4) Regulate the course of the hearing.\n\n(5) Require persons requesting to make a statement at a public input hearing to state their name, occupation and place of employment for the record.\n\n(6) Hold conferences for settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties.\n\n(7) Dispose of procedural requests or similar matters.\n\n(8) Make decisions or recommend decisions in conformity within this part.\n\n(9) Take any other action authorized by commission rule.\n\n(e) Interlocutory appeals.--A presiding officer may certify to the commission, or allow the parties an interlocutory appeal to the commission on any material question arising in the course of a proceeding, where he finds that it is necessary to do so to prevent substantial prejudice to any party or to expedite the conduct of the proceeding. The presiding officer or the commission may thereafter stay the proceeding if necessary to protect the substantial rights of any of the parties therein. The commission shall determine the question forthwith and the hearing and further decision shall thereafter be governed accordingly. No interlocutory appeal to the commission shall otherwise be allowed, except as may be allowed by the commission.\n\n(f) Declaratory orders.--The commission, with like effect as in the case of other orders, and in its sound discretion, may issue a declaratory order to terminate a controversy or remove uncertainty.\n\n(g) Official notice defined.--As used in this chapter the term \"official notice\" means a method by which the commission may notify all parties that no further evidence will be heard on a material fact and that unless the parties prove to the contrary, the commission's findings will include that particular fact.\n\n(Nov. 26, 1978, P.L.1241, No.294, eff. 60 days; July 10, 1986, P.L.1238, No.114, eff. imd.)\n\n1986 Amendment.Act 114 amended subsec.

No sanction shall be imposed or rule or order be issued except upon consideration of the whole record or such portions thereof as may be cited by any party and as supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative and substantial evidence.\n\n(c) Submission of evidence.--Every party is entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The commission may, by rule, adopt procedures for the submission of all or part of the evidence in written form.\n\n(d) Record, briefs and argument.--The transcript of a public input hearing, the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, constitutes the exclusive record for decision, and shall be available for inspection by the public. Briefing and oral argument shall be held in accordance with rules established by the commission. For the purpose of this section, a public input hearing is a hearing held in the service area at which the ratepayers may offer testimony, written or otherwise, relating to any matter which has a bearing on the proceeding.\n\n(e) Official notice of facts.--When the commission's decision rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, upon notification that facts are about to be or have been noticed, any party adversely affected shall have the opportunity upon timely request to show that the facts are not properly noticed or that alternative facts should be noticed. The commission in its discretion shall determine whether written presentations suffice, or whether oral argument, oral evidence, or cross-examination is appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the application by the commission in appropriate circumstances of the doctrine of judicial notice.\n\n(f) Actions of parties and counsel.--Any party who shall fail to be represented at a scheduled conference or hearing after being duly notified thereof, shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to participate in such conference or hearing, and shall not be permitted thereafter to reopen the disposition of any matter accomplished thereat, or to recall for further examination of witnesses who were excused, unless the presiding officer shall determine that failure to be represented was unavoidable and that the interests of the other parties and the public would not be prejudiced by permitting such reopening or further examination. If the actions of a party or counsel in a proceeding shall be determined by the commission, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, to be obstructive to the orderly conduct of the proceeding and inimical to the public interest, the commission may reject or dismiss any rule or order in any manner proposed by the offending party or counsel, and, with respect to counsel, may bar further participation by him in any proceedings before the commission.\n\n(g) Decision of administrative law judge.--In all on-the-record proceedings referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) (relating to powers of commission and administrative law judges), hearings shall be commenced by the administrative law judge within 90 days after the proceeding is initiated, and he shall render a decision within 90 days after the record is closed, unless the commission for good cause by order allows an extension not to exceed an additional 90 days.\n\n(h) Exceptions and appeal procedure.--Any party to a proceeding referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) may file exceptions to the decision of the administrative law judge with the commission, in a form and manner and within the time to be prescribed by the commission. The commission shall rule upon such exceptions within 90 days after filing. If no exceptions are filed, the decision shall become final, without further commission action, unless two or more commissioners within 15 days after the decision request that the commission review the decision and make such other order, within 90 days of such request, as it shall determine. The Office of Trial Staff and the chief counsel shall be deemed to have automatic standing as a party to such proceeding and may file exceptions to any decision of the administrative law judge under this subsection.\n\n(i) Review of testimony.--Any party of record in an investigation or inquiry by or hearing before the commission or its representative whose testimony is recorded electronically and subsequently transcribed shall, upon request, be permitted to review the recording to ensure that it has been transcribed accurately. The commission may impose a fee in an amount not exceeding the actual costs involved for making the recording available. Any request to review the recording must be made within the time prescribed by commission regulation, and such request shall not be used to unreasonably delay commission proceedings. This section shall not be construed to require the electronic recording of testimony. The official record of a proceeding shall be the written transcript.\n\n(Nov. 26, 1978, P.L.1241, No.294, eff. 60 days; Oct. 10, 1985, P.L.257, No.62, eff. 60 days; July 10, 1986, P.L.1238, No.114, eff. imd.; Apr. 21, 1989, P.L.11, No.3, eff. imd.)\n\n1989 Amendment.Act 3 added subsec.

      "text": "(a) Conferences.--The presiding officer shall have the authority to hold one or more prehearing conferences during the course of the proceeding on his own motion or at the request of a party to the proceeding. The presiding officer shall normally hold at least one prehearing conference in proceedings where the issues are complex or where it appears likely that the hearing will last a considerable period of time. In addition to other matters which the commission may prescribe by rule, the presiding officer at a prehearing conference may direct the parties to exchange their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists prior to the hearing. Where good cause exists, the parties may at any time amend, by deletion or supplementation, their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists.\n\n(b) Depositions.--A party to the proceeding shall be able to take depositions of witnesses upon oral examination or written questions for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) The taking of depositions shall normally be deferred until there has been at least one prehearing conference.\n\n(2) The party seeking to take a deposition shall apply to the presiding officer for an order to do so.\n\n(3) The party seeking to take a deposition shall serve copies of the application on the other party or parties to the proceedings, who shall be given an opportunity, along with the deponent, to notify the presiding officer of any objections to the taking of the deposition.\n\n(4) The presiding officer shall not grant an application to take a deposition if he finds that the taking of the deposition would result in undue delay.\n\n(5) The presiding officer shall otherwise grant an application to take a deposition unless he finds that there is not good cause for doing so.\n\n(6) The deposing of a commission employee shall only be allowed upon an order of the presiding officer based on a specific finding that the party applying to take the deposition is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. Any such order shall be subject to an interlocutory appeal to the commission.\n\n(7) An order to take a deposition shall be enforceable through the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum.\n\n(c) Disclosure of information on witnesses.--At the prehearing conference or at some other reasonable time prior to the hearing, which may be established by commission rule, each party to the proceeding shall make available to the other parties to the proceeding the names of the witnesses he expects to call and the subject matter of their expected testimony. Where good cause exists, the parties shall have the right at any time to amend, by deletion or supplementation, the list of names of the witnesses they plan to call and the subject matter of the expected testimony of those witnesses.\n\n(d) Interrogatories.--Any party to a proceeding may serve written interrogatories upon any other party for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information. A party served with interrogatories may, before the time prescribed either by commission rule or otherwise for answering the interrogatories, apply to the presiding officer for the holding of a prehearing conference for the mutual exchange of evidence exhibits and other information. Each interrogatory which requests information not previously supplied at a prehearing conference or hearing shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for the objections shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections within a reasonable time, unless otherwise specified, upon the party submitting the interrogatories. The party submitting the interrogatories may petition the presiding officer for an order compelling an answer to an interrogatory or interrogatories to which there has been an objection or other failure to answer. The commission shall designate an appropriate official, other than the Director of Trial Staff or any other employee of the Office of Trial Staff, on whom other parties to the proceeding may serve written interrogatories directed to the commission. That official shall arrange for agency personnel with knowledge of the facts to answer and sign the interrogatories on behalf of the commission. Interrogatories directed to the commission shall be allowed only upon an order of the commission based upon a specific finding that the interrogating party is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. When participating in a commission proceeding, the Office of Trial Staff shall be subject to the same rules of discovery applicable to any other party to the case.\n\n(e) Requests for admissions.--A party to a proceeding may serve upon any other party and upon the commission to the same extent permissible in subsection (d) a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding and to conserve hearing time, of any relevant, unprivileged, undisputed facts, the genuineness of any document described in the request, the admissibility of evidence, the order of proof and other similar matters.\n\n(f) Subpoena duces tecum.--A party to a proceeding may obtain in accordance with commission rules a subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of or the making available for inspection, copying or photographing of relevant necessary designated documents at a prehearing conference or other specific time and place.\n\n(g) Scheduling.--The presiding officer shall have the authority to impose schedules on the parties to the proceeding specifying the periods of time during which the parties may pursue each means of discovery available to them under the rules of the commission. Such schedules and time periods shall be set with a view to accelerating disposition of the case to the fullest extent consistent with fairness.\n\n(h) Certification of interlocutory appeals.--Except as provided in subsection (b)(6), an interlocutory appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer on discovery shall be allowed only upon certification by the presiding officer that the ruling involves an important question of law or policy which should be resolved at that time. Notwithstanding the presiding officer's certification, the commission shall have the authority to dismiss summarily the interlocutory appeal if it should appear that the certification was improvident. An interlocutory appeal shall not result in a stay of the proceedings except upon a finding by the presiding officer and the commission that extraordinary circumstances exist.\n\n(i) Protective orders.--The presiding officer shall have the authority, upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, to make any order, subject to the rules of the commission, which justice requires to protect the party or person.\n\n(j) Other subpoenas.--The presiding officer shall have the power in accordance with commission rules to issue subpoenas ad testificandum and duces tecum at any time during the course of the proceeding.\n\n(July 10, 1986, P.L.1238, No.114, eff. imd.)\n\n1986 Amendment.Act 114 amended subsec.
