      "text": "(a) Satisfaction of complaint or hearing.--If any party complained against, within the time specified by the commission, shall satisfy the complaint, the commission shall dismiss the complaint. Such party shall be relieved from responsibility only for the specific matter complained of. If such party shall not satisfy the complaint within the time specified, and it shall appear to the commission from a consideration of the complaint and answer, or otherwise, that reasonable ground exists for investigating such complaint, it shall be the duty of the commission to fix a time and place for a hearing.\n\n(b) Notice of hearing.--The commission shall fix the time and place of hearing, within or without this Commonwealth, if any is required, and shall serve notice thereof upon parties in interest. The commission may dismiss any complaint without a hearing if, in its opinion, a hearing is not necessary in the public interest.\n\n(c) Hearing and record.--All hearings before the commission, or its representative, shall be public, and shall be conducted in accordance with such regulations as the commission may prescribe. A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings had before the commission, or its representative, on any formal hearing, and all testimony shall be taken down by a reporter appointed by the commission, and the parties shall be entitled to be heard in person or by attorney, and to introduce evidence.\n\n(d) Informal hearings.--The commission may, in addition to the hearings specially provided by this part, conduct such other hearings as may be required in the administration of the powers and duties conferred upon it by this part and by other acts relating to public utilities. Reasonable notice of all such hearings shall be given the persons interested therein.\n\n(e) Decisions by commission.--After the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall make and file its findings and order with its opinion, if any. Its findings shall be in sufficient detail to enable the court on appeal, to determine the controverted question presented by the proceeding, and whether proper weight was given to the evidence. A copy of such order, certified under the seal of the commission, shall be served by registered or certified mail upon the party or parties against whom it runs, or his attorney, and notice thereof shall be given to the other parties to the proceedings or their attorney. Such order shall take effect and become operative as designated therein, and shall continue in force either for a period which may be designated therein, or until changed or revoked by the commission. The commission may grant and prescribe such additional time as, in its judgment, is reasonably necessary to comply with the order, and may, on application and for good cause shown, extend the time for compliance fixed in its order.\n\n(f) Rehearing.--After an order has been made by the commission, any party to the proceedings may, within 15 days after the service of the order, apply for a rehearing in respect of any matters determined in such proceedings and specified in the application for rehearing, and the commission may grant and hold such rehearing on such matters. No application for a rehearing shall in anywise operate as a supersedeas, or in any manner stay or postpone the enforcement of any existing order, except as the commission may, by order, direct. If the application be granted, the commission may affirm, rescind, or modify its original order.\n\n(g) Rescission and amendment of orders.--The commission may, at any time, after notice and after opportunity to be heard as provided in this chapter, rescind or amend any order made by it. Any order rescinding or amending a prior order shall, when served upon the person, corporation, or municipal corporation affected, and after notice thereof is given to the other parties to the proceedings, have the same effect as is herein provided for original orders.",
