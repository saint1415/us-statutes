      "text": "(a) General rule.--Any public utility, except common carriers and those natural gas distributors with gross intrastate annual operating revenues in excess of $40,000,000 with respect to the gas costs of such natural gas distributors, may establish a sliding scale of rates or such other method for the automatic adjustment of the rates of the public utility as shall provide a just and reasonable return on the rate base of such public utility, to be determined upon such equitable or reasonable basis as shall provide such fair return. A tariff showing the scale of rates under such arrangement shall first be filed with the commission, and such tariff, and each rate set out therein, approved by it. The commission may revoke its approval at any time and fix other rates for any such public utility if, after notice and hearing, the commission finds the existing rates unjust or unreasonable.\n\n(b) Mandatory system for automatic adjustment.--The commission, by regulation or order, upon reasonable notice and after hearing, may prescribe for any class of public utilities, except common carriers and those natural gas distributors with gross intrastate annual operating revenues in excess of $40,000,000, a mandatory system for the automatic adjustment of their rates, by means of a sliding scale of rates or other method, on the same basis as provided in subsection (a), to become effective when and in the manner prescribed in such regulation or order. Every such public utility shall, within such time as shall be prescribed by the commission, file tariffs showing the rates established in accordance with such regulation or order.\n\n(c) Fuel cost adjustment.--In any method automatically adjusting rates to reflect changes in fossil fuel cost under this section, the fuel cost used in computing the adjustment shall be limited, in the case of an electric utility, to the cost of such fuel delivered to the utility at the generating site at which it is to be consumed, and the cost of disposing of solid waste from scrubbers or other devices designed so that the consumption of Pennsylvania-mined coal at the generating site would comply with the sulfur oxide emission standards prescribed by the Commonwealth. The cost of fuel handling after such delivery, or of waste disposal, other than as prescribed in this section, shall be excluded from such computation. In any method automatically adjusting rates to reflect changes in fuel cost other than fossil fuel cost under this section, the fuel cost used in computing the adjustment shall be limited, in the case of an electric utility, to the cost of such fuel delivered to the utility at the generating site at which it is to be consumed after deducting therefrom the present salvage or reuse value of such fuel, as shall be established by commission rule or order.\n\n(d) Fuel cost adjustment audits.--The commission shall conduct or cause to be conducted, at such times as it may order, but at least annually, an audit of each public utility which, by any method described in this section, automatically adjusts its rates to reflect changes in its fuel costs, which audit shall enable the commission to determine the propriety and correctness of amounts billed and collected under this section. Whoever performs the audit shall be a person knowledgable in the subject matter encompassed within the operation of the automatic adjustment clause. The auditors report shall be in a form and manner directed by the commission.\n\n(e) Automatic adjustment reports and proceedings.--\n\n(1) Within 30 days following the end of such 12-month period as the commission shall designate, each public utility using an automatic adjustment clause shall file with the commission a statement which shall specify for such period:\n\n(i) the total revenues received pursuant to the automatic adjustment clause;\n\n(ii) the total amount of that expense or class of expenses incurred which is the basis of the automatic adjustment clause; and\n\n(iii) the difference between the amounts specified by subparagraphs (i) and (ii).\n\nSuch report shall be a matter of public record and copies thereof shall be made available to any person upon request to the commission.\n\n(2) Within 60 days following the submission of such report by a public utility, the commission shall hold a public hearing on the substance of the report and any matters pertaining to the use by such public utility of such automatic adjustment clause in the preceding period and may include the present and subsequent periods.\n\n(3) Absent good reason being shown to the contrary, the commission shall, within 60 days following such hearing, by order direct each such public utility to, over an appropriate 12-month period, refund to its patrons an amount equal to that by which its revenues received pursuant to such automatic adjustment clause exceeded the amount of such expense or class of expenses, or recover from its patrons an amount equal to that by which such expense or class of expenses exceeded the revenues received pursuant to such automatic adjustment clause.\n\n(4) For the purpose of this subsection, where a 12-month report period and 12-month refund or recovery period shall have been previously established or designated, nothing in this section shall impair the continued use of such previously established or designated periods nor shall anything in this section prevent the commission from amending at any time any method used by any utility in automatically adjusting its rates, so as to provide the commission more adequate supervision of the administration by a utility of such method and to decrease the likelihood of collection by a utility, in subsequent periods, of amounts greater or less than that to which it is entitled, or, in the event that such deficiency or surplus in collected amounts is found, more prompt readjustment thereof.\n\n(f) Recovery of natural gas costs.--\n\n(1) Natural gas distribution companies, as defined in section 2202 (relating to definitions), with gross intrastate annual operating revenues in excess of $40,000,000 may file tariffs reflecting actual and projected increases or decreases in their natural gas costs, and the tariffs shall have an effective date six months from the date of filing. The commission shall promulgate regulations establishing the time and manner of such filing, but, except for adjustments pursuant to a tariff mechanism authorized in this title, no such natural gas distribution company shall voluntarily file more than one such tariff in a 12-month period: Provided, That:\n\n(i) Nothing contained herein shall prohibit any party from advising the commission that there has been or there is anticipated to be a significant difference between the natural gas costs to the natural gas distribution company and the costs reflected in the then effective tariff or the commission from acting upon such advice.\n\n(ii) A natural gas distribution company may also file a tariff to establish a mechanism by which such natural gas distribution company may further adjust its rates for natural gas sales on a regular, but no more frequent than monthly, basis to reflect actual or projected changes in natural gas costs reflected in rates established pursuant to paragraph (2), subject to annual reconciliation under paragraph (5). In the event that the natural gas distribution company adjusts rates more frequently than quarterly, it shall also offer retail gas customers a fixed-rate option which recovers natural gas costs over a 12-month period, subject to annual reconciliation under paragraph (5). The commission shall, within 60 days of the effective date of this subparagraph, promulgate rules or regulations governing such adjustments and fixed-rate option, but the commission shall not prohibit such adjustments or fixed-rate option.\n\n(2) The commission shall conduct an investigation and hold a hearing or hearings, with notice, to review the tariffs and consider the plans filed pursuant to section 1317 (relating to regulation of natural gas costs). Where there has been an indication of consumer interest, the hearing shall be held in the service territory of the natural gas distribution company. Prior to the effective date of the filing, the commission shall issue an order establishing the rate to be charged to reflect such changes in natural gas costs. The commission shall annually review and approve plans for purposes of reliability and supply. Such rates, however, are subject to the same types of audits, reports and proceedings required by subsection (d).\n\n(3) Within 60 days following the end of such 12-month period as the commission shall designate, each natural gas distribution company subject to this subsection shall file with the commission a statement which specifies for such period:\n\n(i) The total revenues received pursuant to this section.\n\n(ii) The total natural gas costs incurred.\n\n(iii) The difference between the amounts specified by subparagraphs (i) and (ii).\n\n(iv) How actual natural gas costs incurred differ from the natural gas costs allowed under paragraph (2) and why such differences occurred.\n\n(v) How these natural gas costs are consistent with a least cost procurement policy as required by section 1318 (relating to determination of just and reasonable gas cost rates).\n\nSuch report shall be a matter of public record and copies thereof shall be made available by the natural gas distribution company to any person upon request. Copies of the reports shall be filed with the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate at the same time as they are filed with the commission.\n\n(4) The commission shall hold a public hearing on the substance of such statement submitted by a natural gas distribution company as required in paragraph (3) and on any related matters.\n\n(5) The commission, after hearing, shall determine the portion of the company's natural gas distribution actual natural gas costs in the previous 12-month period which meet the standards set out in section 1318. The commission shall, by order, direct each natural gas distribution company subject to this subsection to refund to its customers gas revenues collected pursuant to paragraph (2) which exceed the amount of actual natural gas costs incurred consistent with the standards in section 1318 and to recover from its customers any amount by which the actual natural gas costs, which have been incurred consistent with the standards in section 1318, exceed the revenues collected pursuant to paragraph (2). Absent good reason to the contrary, the commission shall issue its order within six months following the filing of the statement described in paragraph (3). Refunds to customers shall be made with and recoveries from customers shall include interest at the prime rate for commercial borrowing in effect 60 days prior to the tariff filing made under paragraph (1) and as reported in a publicly available source identified by the commission or at an interest rate which may be established by the commission by regulation. Nothing under this paragraph shall limit the applicability of a defense, principle or doctrine which would prohibit the commission's inquiry into matters that were decided finally in the commission's order issued under paragraph (2).\n\n(6) If the natural gas distribution company's actual natural gas costs exceed the revenues collected under paragraph (2) by more than 10% in the previous 12-month period provided for under paragraph (5) due to customers switching from sales service to transportation service, the natural gas distribution company shall have the right to fully recover the under-collection through a nonbypassable charge. A request for authorization to impose a nonbypassable charge shall be made to the commission in a natural gas distribution company's annual filing under this section or at the time of the filing.\n\n(g) Recovery of costs related to distribution system improvement projects designed to enhance water quality, fire protection reliability and long-term system viability.--(Repealed).\n\n(g.1) Surcharge recoverability and offset.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this title or prior order of the commission, a surcharge imposed on and paid by a public utility under section 1111-A of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971, is recoverable under this section by such means as approved by the commission. Retail rates as adjusted in accordance with this subsection shall also reflect any reduction in Public Utility Realty Tax Act liabilities secured by the utility and adjustments in State taxes reflected in any applicable State tax adjustment surcharge as defined by commission regulations.\n\n(h) Definition.--As used in this section, the terms \"natural gas costs\" and \"gas costs\" include the direct costs paid by a natural gas distribution company for the purchase and the delivery of natural gas to its system in order to supply its customers. Such costs may include costs paid under agreements to purchase natural gas from sellers; costs paid for transporting natural gas to its system; costs paid for natural gas storage service from others, including the costs of injecting and withdrawing natural gas from storage; all charges, fees, taxes and rates paid in connection with such purchases, pipeline gathering, storage and transportation; and costs paid for employing futures, options and other risk management tools. \"Natural gas\" and \"gas\" include natural gas, liquified natural gas, synthetic natural gas and any natural gas substitutes.\n\n(May 31, 1984, P.L.370, No.74, eff. 60 days; Sept. 27, 1984, P.L.721, No.153, eff. 60 days; Dec. 21, 1984, P.L.1265, No.240, eff. imd.; Dec. 18, 1996, P.L.1061, No.156, eff. 60 days; June 22, 1999, P.L.122, No.21, eff.

      "text": "(a) General rule.--Unless the commission otherwise orders, no public utility shall make any change in any existing and duly established rate, except after 60 days notice to the commission, which notice shall plainly state the changes proposed to be made in the rates then in force, and the time when the changed rates will go into effect. The public utility shall also give such notice of the proposed changes to other interested persons as the commission in its discretion may direct. Such notices regarding the proposed changes which are provided to the utility's customers shall be in plain understandable language as the commission shall prescribe. All proposed changes shall be shown by filing new tariffs, or supplements to existing tariffs filed and in force at the time. The commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes in rates, without requiring the 60 days notice, under such conditions as it may prescribe.\n\n(b) Hearing and suspension of rate change.--Whenever there is filed with the commission by any public utility any tariff stating a new rate, the commission may, either upon complaint or upon its own motion, upon reasonable notice, enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate, and pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the commission, upon filing with such tariff and delivering to the public utility affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons therefor, may, at any time before it becomes effective, suspend the operation of such rate for a period not longer than six months from the time such rate would otherwise become effective, and an additional period of not more than three months pending such decision. The rate in force when the tariff stating the new rate was filed shall continue in force during the period of suspension, unless the commission shall establish a temporary rate as authorized in section 1310 (relating to temporary rates). The commission shall consider the effect of such suspension in finally determining and prescribing the rates to be thereafter charged and collected by such public utility. This subsection shall not apply to any tariff stating a new rate which constitutes a general rate increase as defined in subsection (d).\n\n(c) Determination.--If, after such hearing, the commission finds any such rate to be unjust or unreasonable, or in anywise in violation of law, the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate to be charged or applied by the public utility for the service in question, and shall fix the same by order to be served upon the public utility and such rate shall thereafter be observed until changed as provided by this part.\n\n(d) General rate increases.--Whenever there is filed with the commission by any public utility described in paragraph (1)(i), (ii), (vi) or (vii) of the definition of \"public utility\" in section 102 (relating to definitions), and such other public utility as the commission may by rule or regulation direct, any tariff stating a new rate which constitutes a general rate increase, the commission shall promptly enter into an investigation and analysis of said tariff filing and may by order setting forth its reasons therefor, upon complaint or upon its own motion, upon reasonable notice, enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate, and the commission may, at any time by vote of a majority of the members of the commission serving in accordance with law, permit such tariff to become effective, except that absent such order such tariff shall be suspended for a period not to exceed seven months from the time such rate would otherwise become effective. Before the expiration of such seven-month period, a majority of the members of the commission serving in accordance with law, acting unanimously, shall make a final decision and order, setting forth its reasons therefor, granting or denying, in whole or in part, the general rate increase requested. If, however, such an order has not been made at the expiration of such seven-month period, the proposed general rate increase shall go into effect at the end of such period, but the commission may by order require the interested public utility to refund, in accordance with section 1312 (relating to refunds), to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were paid, such portion of such increased rates as by its decision shall be found not justified, plus interest, which shall be the average rate of interest specified for residential mortgage lending by the Secretary of Banking in accordance with the act of January 30, 1974 (P.L.13, No.6), referred to as the Loan Interest and Protection Law, during the period or periods for which the commission orders refunds. The rate in force when the tariff stating such new rate was filed shall continue in force during the period of suspension unless the commission shall grant extraordinary rate relief as prescribed in subsection (e). The commission shall consider the effect of such suspension in finally determining and prescribing the rates to be thereafter charged and collected by such public utility, except that the commission shall have no authority to prescribe, determine or fix, at any time during the pendency of a general rate increase proceeding or prior to a final determination of a general rate increase request, temporary rates as provided in section 1310, which rates may provide retroactive increases through recoupment. As used in this part general rate increase means a tariff filing which affects more than 5% of the customers and amounts to in excess of 3% of the total gross annual intrastate operating revenues of the public utility. If the public utility furnishes two or more types of service, the foregoing percentages shall be determined only on the basis of the customers receiving, and the revenues derived from, the type of service to which the tariff filing pertains.\n\n(d.1) Multiple filings prohibited.--Except as required to implement an order granting extraordinary rate relief, no public utility which has filed a general rate increase request pursuant to this section shall file an additional general rate increase request pursuant to this section for the same type of service until the commission has made a final decision and order on the prior general rate increase request or until the expiration of the maximum period of suspension of the prior general rate increase request pursuant to this section, whichever is earlier.\n\n(e) Extraordinary rate relief.--Upon petition to the commission at the time of filing of a rate request or at any time during the pendency of proceedings on such rate request, any public utility may seek extraordinary rate relief of such portion of the total rate relief requested as can be shown to be immediately necessary for the maintenance of financial stability in order to enable the utility to continue providing normal services to its customers, avoid reductions in its normal maintenance programs, avoid substantially reducing its employment, and which will provide no more than the rate of return on the utility's common equity established by the commission in consideration of the utility's preceding rate filing, except that no utility shall file, either with a request for a general rate increase or at any time during the pendency of such a request, more than one petition under this subsection pertaining to rates for a particular type of service, nor any supplement or amendment thereto, except when permitted to do so by order of the commission. Any public utility requesting extraordinary rate relief shall file with the petition sufficient additional testimony and exhibits which will permit the commission to make appropriate findings on the petition. The public utility shall give notice of the petition in the same manner as its filing upon which this petition is based. The commission shall within 30 days from the date of the filing of a petition for extraordinary rate relief, and after hearing for the purpose of cross-examination of the testimony and exhibits of the public utility, and the presentation of such other evidentiary testimony as the commission may by rule prescribe, by order setting forth its reasons therefor, grant or deny, in whole or in part, the extraordinary relief requested. Absent such order, the petition shall be deemed to have been denied. Rates established pursuant to extraordinary rate relief shall not be deemed to be temporary rates within the meaning of that term as it is used in section 1310.\n\n(f) Limitation on rate increases by certain public utilities.--Whenever there is filed with the commission any tariff stating a new rate based in whole or in part on the cost of constructing an electric generating unit, the commission shall compare the estimated construction cost filed in accordance with section 515(a) (relating to construction cost of electric generating units) with the actual construction cost submitted by the utility in support of that tariff. If the actual construction cost exceeds the estimated construction cost, the rate determined by the commission under this section shall not be based on any part of that excess unless the public utility proves that part of the excess to have been necessary and proper. In making its determination under this subsection, the commission shall consider all relevant and material evidence, including evidence obtained pursuant to section 515. For purposes of this subsection \"construction\" includes any work performed on an electric generating unit which required, or is expected to require, the affected public utility to incur an aggregate of at least $100,000,000 of expenses which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are capital expenses and not operating or maintenance expenses.\n\n(July 6, 1984, P.L.602, No.123, eff. imd.; Sept. 27, 1984, P.L.721, No.153, eff. imd.; Dec. 21, 1984, P.L.1265, No.240, eff. imd.)\n\n1984 Amendments.Act 123 added subsec.

Whenever a public utility does not itself produce or generate that which it distributes, transmits, or furnishes to the public for compensation, but obtains the same from another source, the commission shall have the power and authority to investigate the cost of such production or generation in any investigation of the reasonableness of the rates of such public utility.\n\n(b) Deadline for decision.--Before the expiration of a nine-month period beginning on the date of the commission's motion or the filing of a complaint pursuant to subsection (a), a majority of the members of the commission serving in accordance with law, acting unanimously, shall make a final decision and order, setting forth its reasons therefor. If such an order has not been made at the expiration of such nine-month period and the motion or complaint pursuant to subsection (a) requested a reduction in rates, a final decision and order of the commission which determines or fixes a rate reduction shall be retroactive to the expiration of such nine-month period, provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the commission from setting temporary rates pursuant to section 1310 (relating to temporary rates) prior to the expiration of such nine-month period and giving such effect to the setting of temporary rates as is otherwise permitted by this title. This subsection shall apply only when the requested reduction in rates affects more than 5% of the customers and amounts to in excess of 3% of the total gross annual intrastate operating revenues of the public utility, provided that, if the public utility furnishes two or more types of service, the foregoing percentages shall be determined only on the basis of the customers receiving, and the revenues derived from, the type of service to which the requested reduction pertains. This subsection shall not apply to any proceeding involving a change in rates proposed by a public utility pursuant to section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) or 1308 (relating to voluntary changes in rates).\n\n(July 6, 1988, P.L.490, No.83, eff. imd.)\n\nCross References.Section 1309 is referred to in sections 514, 521, 1327, 3019 of this title.",

Such temporary rates, so fixed, determined, and prescribed, shall be sufficient to provide a return of not less than 5% upon the original cost, less accrued depreciation, of the physical property, when first devoted to public use, of such public utility, used and useful in the public service, and if the duly verified reports of such public utility to the commission do not show such original cost, less accrued depreciation, of such property, the commission may estimate such cost less depreciation and fix, determine, and prescribe rates as hereinbefore provided.\n\n(b) Exception where records unavailable.--If any public utility does not have continuing property records, kept in the manner prescribed by the commission under the provisions of section 1702 (relating to continuing property records), then the commission, after reasonable notice and hearing, may establish temporary rates which shall be sufficient to provide a return of not less than an amount equal to the operating income for such prior calendar, fiscal or other year as the commission may deem proper, to be determined on the basis of data appearing in the annual report of such public utility to the commission for such prior year as the commission may deem proper, plus or minus such return as the commission may prescribe from time to time upon such net changes of the physical property as are reported to and approved for rate-making purposes by the commission. In determining the net changes of the physical property, the commission may, in its discretion, deduct from gross additions to such physical property the amount charged to operating expenses for depreciation or, in lieu thereof, it may determine such net changes by deducting retirements from the gross additions. The commission, in determining the basis for temporary rates, may make such adjustments in the annual report data as may, in the judgment of the commission, be necessary and proper.\n\n(c) Periodicity of rates.--The commission may fix, determine, and prescribe temporary rates every month, or at any other interval, if it be of opinion that the public interest so requires, and the existence of proceedings begun for the purpose of establishing final rates shall not prevent the commission from changing every month, or at any other interval, such temporary rates as it has previously fixed, determined, and prescribed.\n\n(d) Excessive rates.--Whenever the commission, upon examination of any annual or other report, or of any papers, records, books, or documents, or of the property of any public utility, shall be of opinion that any rates of such public utility are producing a return in excess of a fair return upon the fair value of the property of such public utility, used and useful in its public service, the commission may, by order, prescribe for a trial period of at least six months, which trial period may be extended for one additional period of six months, such temporary rates to be observed by such public utility as, in the opinion of the commission, will produce a fair return upon such fair value, and the rates so prescribed shall become effective upon the date specified in the order of the commission. Such rates, so prescribed, shall become permanent at the end of such trial period, or extension thereof, unless at any time during such trial period, or extension thereof, the public utility involved shall complain to the commission that the rates so prescribed are unjust or unreasonable. Upon such complaint, the commission, after hearing, shall determine the issues involved, and pending final determination the rates so prescribed shall remain in effect.\n\n(e) Effect and adjustment of rates.--Temporary rates so fixed, determined, and prescribed under this section shall be effective until the final determination of the rate proceeding, unless terminated sooner by the commission. In every proceeding in which temporary rates are fixed, determined, and prescribed under this section, the commission shall consider the effect of such rates in fixing, determining, and prescribing rates to be thereafter demanded or received by such public utility on final determination of the rate proceeding.\n\nCross References.Section 1310 is referred to in sections 1308, 1309 of this title.",

A utility that provides water and wastewater service shall be exempt from this subsection upon petition of a utility to combine water and wastewater revenue requirements. The commission, when setting base rates, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, may allocate a portion of the wastewater revenue requirement to the combined water and wastewater customer base if in the public interest.\n\n(d) Common carriers.--In fixing any rate of a public utility engaged exclusively as a common carrier by motor vehicle, the commission may, in lieu of other standards established by law, fix the fair return by relating the fair and reasonable operating expenses, depreciation, taxes and other costs of furnishing service to operating revenues.\n\n(e) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \"utility that provides both water and wastewater service\" shall include separate companies that individually provide water or wastewater service so long as the companies are wholly owned by a common parent company.\n\n(Sept. 27, 1984, P.L.721, No.153, eff. 60 days; Dec. 21, 1984, P.L.1265, No.240, eff. imd.; Feb. 14, 2012, P.L.72, No.11, eff. 60 days; Oct. 24, 2018, P.L.738, No.120, eff. 60 days)\n\n2018 Amendment.Act 120 amended subsec.

The following shall apply:\n\n(1) The pretax return shall be calculated using the Federal and State income tax rates, the utility's actual capital structure and actual cost rates for long-term debt and preferred stock as of the last day of the three-month period ending one month prior to the effective date of the distribution system improvement charge and subsequent updates.\n\n(2) The cost of equity shall be the equity return rate approved in the utility's most recent fully litigated base rate proceeding for which a final order was entered not more than two years prior to the effective date of the distribution system improvement charge.\n\n(3) If more than two years have elapsed between the entry of a final order and the effective date of the distribution system improvement charge, the equity return rate used in the calculation shall be the equity return rate calculated by the commission in the most recent Quarterly Report on the Earnings of Jurisdictional Utilities released by the commission.\n\n(c) Recovery of costs.--Utilities may file tariffs establishing a sliding scale of rates or other method for the automatic adjustment of the rates of the utility to provide for recovery of the depreciation and pretax return fixed costs of eligible property, as approved by the commission, that are completed and placed in service between base rate proceedings. For city natural gas distribution operations, recoverable costs shall be amounts reasonably expended or incurred to purchase and install eligible property and associated financing costs, if any, including debt service, debt service coverage and issuance costs.\n\n(d) Calculation.--\n\n(1) The distribution system improvement charge shall be expressed as a percentage carried to two decimal places and shall be applied in a manner consistent with section 1358 (relating to customer protections) to each customer under the utility's applicable rates and charges. The charge shall not be applied to amounts billed for public fire protection service by water utilities and the State tax adjustment surcharge.\n\n(2) The distribution system improvement charge shall be calculated by dividing one-fourth of the annual fixed costs associated with all eligible property under the distribution system improvement charge by the projected revenue for the quarterly period during which the distribution system will be collected. The projected revenues shall not include revenues from public fire protection service earned by water utilities and the State tax adjustment surcharge.\n\n(3) Supporting data for each quarterly update shall be filed with the commission and served upon the commission, the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate at least ten days prior to the effective date of the update.\n\nCross References.Section 1357 is referred to in section 1311 of this title.",
