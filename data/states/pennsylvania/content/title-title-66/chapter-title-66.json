      "text": "§ 2804. Standards for restructuring of electric industry. The following interdependent standards shall govern the commission's assessment and approval of each public utility's restructuring plan, oversight of the transition process and regulation of the restructured electric utility industry: (1) The commission shall ensure continuation of safe and reliable electric service to all consumers in the Commonwealth, including: (i) The maintenance of adequate reserve margins by electric suppliers in conformity with the standards required by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and the regional reliability council appropriate to each supplier, or any successors to those reliability entities, and in conformity with established industry standards and practices. (ii) The installation and maintenance of transmission and distribution facilities in conformity with established industry standards and practices, including the standards set forth in the National Electric Safety Code. (2) Consistent with the time line set forth in section 2806 (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates), the commission shall allow customers to choose among electric generation suppliers in a competitive generation market through direct access. Customers should be able to choose among alternatives such as firm and interruptible service, flexible pricing and alternate generation sources, including reasonable and fair opportunities to self-generate and interconnect. These alternatives may be provided by different electric generation suppliers. (3) The commission shall require the unbundling of electric utility services, tariffs and customer bills to separate the charges for generation, transmission and distribution. The commission may require the unbundling of other services. (4) The following caps on electric utility rates shall apply: (i) For a period of 54 months from the effective date of this chapter or until an electric distribution utility is no longer recovering its transition or stranded costs through a competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge and all the customers of an electric distribution utility can choose an alternative provider of electric generation, whichever is shorter: (A) the total charges of an electric distribution utility for service to any customer who purchases generation from that utility shall not exceed the total charges that have been approved by the commission for such service as of the effective date of this chapter; and (B) for customers who purchase generation from a supplier other than the electric distribution utility, the charges of the utility for non-generation services that are regulated as of the effective date of this chapter, exclusive of the competitive transition charge and intangible transition charge, shall not exceed the non-generation charges that have been approved by the commission for such service as of the effective date of this chapter. (ii) In addition to the rate cap set forth in subparagraph (i), for a period of nine years from the effective date of this chapter or until an electric distribution utility is no longer recovering its transition or stranded costs through a competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge and all customers of an electric distribution utility can choose an alternative provider of electric generation, whichever is shorter, the generation component of a utility's charges to customers who purchase generation from the utility, including the competitive transition charge and intangible transition charge, shall not exceed the generation component charged to the customers that has been approved by the commission for such service as of the effective date of this chapter. (iii) An electric distribution utility may seek, and the commission may approve, an exception to the limitations set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) only in any of the following circumstances: (A) The electric distribution utility meets the requirements for extraordinary rate relief under section 1308(e) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). (B) Either the electric distribution utility is required to begin payment under contracts with nonutility generation projects that have received commission orders, has been unable to mitigate such costs, such costs are not recoverable in a competitive generation market and such costs were not previously covered in the competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge, or the utility prudently incurs costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation of nonutility generating project obligations of the utility consistent with section 527 (relating to cogeneration rules and regulations) and such costs were not previously covered in the competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge. Costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation shall be recovered from ratepayers over a period not to exceed three years, unless the commission determines within its discretion to require a longer recovery period due to the magnitude of such costs, but shall be accounted for by the utility on a levelized basis over the total period in which the generation portion of the utility's rates are capped. (C) The electric distribution utility is subject to significant increases in the rates of Federal or State taxes or other significant changes in law or regulations that would not allow the utility to earn a fair rate of return. (D) The electric distribution utility is subject to significant increases in the unit rate of fuel for utility generation or the price of purchased power that are outside of the control of the utility and that would not allow the utility to earn a fair rate of return. (E) The electric distribution utility is directed by the commission or an independent system operator or its functional equivalent to make expenditures to repair or upgrade its transmission or distribution system. (F) The electric distribution utility seeks to increase its allowance for nuclear decommissioning costs to reflect new information not available at the time the utility's existing rates were determined, and such costs are not recoverable in the competitive generation market and are not covered in the competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge, and such costs would not allow the utility to earn a fair rate of return. (G) As permitted by paragraph (16). (iv) Consistent with the requirements of due process, the commission may expedite proceedings that invoke the provisions of subparagraph (iii). (v) If an electric distribution utility rolls its energy cost rate into base rates at a combined level that does not exceed its combined level of such rates which have been approved by the commission as of the effective date of this chapter, the utility shall not be required to reduce its capped rates below the capped level upon the complaint of any party if the commission determines that any excess earnings achieved under the cap are being utilized to mitigate transition or stranded costs for the benefit of ratepayers or to offset other known and measurable cost increases that would be recoverable under traditional ratemaking but are not included within the capped rates. (vi) This paragraph shall not apply to new services offered for the first time after the effective date of this chapter. (5) The commission may permit, but shall not require, an electric utility to divest itself of facilities or to reorganize its corporate structure. (6) Consistent with the provision of section 2806, the commission shall require that a public utility that owns or operates jurisdictional transmission and distribution facilities shall provide transmission and distribution service to all retail electric customers in their service territory and to electric cooperative corporations and electric generation suppliers, affiliated or nonaffiliated, on rates, terms of access and conditions that are comparable to the utility's own use of its system. (7) The commission shall require that restructuring of the electric utility industry be implemented in a manner that does not unreasonably discriminate against one customer class to the benefit of another. (8) The commission shall establish for each electric utility an appropriate cost-recovery mechanism which is designed to fully recover the electric utility's universal service and energy conservation costs over the life of these programs. (9) The commission shall ensure that universal service and energy conservation policies, activities and services are appropriately funded and available in each electric distribution territory. Policies, activities and services under this paragraph shall be funded in each electric distribution territory by nonbypassable, competitively neutral cost-recovery mechanisms that fully recover the costs of universal service and energy conservation services. The commission shall encourage the use of community-based organizations that have the necessary technical and administrative experience to be the direct providers of services or programs which reduce energy consumption or otherwise assist low-income customers to afford electric service. Programs under this paragraph shall be subject to the administrative oversight of the commission which will ensure that the programs are operated in a cost-effective manner. (10) The commission shall establish rates for jurisdictional transmission and distribution services and shall continue to regulate distribution services for new and existing customers in accordance with this chapter and Chapter 13 (relating to rates and rate making). (11) The time line for the transition to and phase-in of direct access to competitive electric generation shall be in accordance with section 2806. (12) The commission has the authority to order utility participation in retail access pilot programs as set forth in section 2806 and as further implemented or modified by the commission, with direct access to begin on April 1, 1997. The commission shall conduct milestone reviews of the transition to retail electric generation competition to assure a technically workable and equitable transition period. (13) Consistent with section 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge), the commission has the power and duty to approve a competitive transition charge for the recovery of transition or stranded costs it determines to be just and reasonable to recover from ratepayers. (14) The transition to a competitive generation market shall be orderly, protect electric system reliability, be fair to ratepayers and provide the investors in Pennsylvania electric utilities with a fair opportunity to fully recover the amount of transition or stranded costs that the commission determines to be just and reasonable. (15) At the time each utility files its restructuring plan with the commission, the utility shall submit an initial plan that sets forth how it shall meet its universal service and energy conservation obligations. (16) The following shall apply: (i) The commission shall issue regulations that permit the electric distribution company to recover any change in its State tax liability under sections 2806(h), 2809(c) (relating to requirements for electric generation suppliers) and 2810 (relating to revenue-neutral reconciliation) or in its liability under 52 Pa. Code §§ 69.51 through 69.56 (relating to inclusion of State taxes and gross receipts taxes in base rates) to the extent that the resulting rate does not exceed the rate cap established in this section except as provided in this chapter. (ii) With regard to any portion of the change in an electric distribution company's tax liability under section 2810 which would cause it to exceed the rate cap, the electric distribution company may file a single issue rate proceeding under section 1308(a) to recover that amount. The commission shall adjudicate, within 60 days, whether the resulting rates are just and reasonable. (iii) With regard to any portion of the change in an electric distribution company's tax liability under sections 2806(h) and 2809(c) which would cause it to exceed the price cap, upon certification to the commission by affidavit that the electric distribution company has not collected the taxes due pursuant to the tariff indemnification provisions required by section 2810(m) and that the electric distribution company and the Department of Revenue have not collected the taxes due pursuant to the other means set forth in sections 2806(g)(3)(i) and (ii) and 2809(c) to recover the taxes due and any interest thereon, the electric distribution utility shall be permitted to recover that amount in the State Tax Adjustment Surcharge.

      "text": "§ 2807. Duties of electric distribution companies. (a) General rule.-- Each electric distribution company shall maintain the integrity of the distribution system at least in conformity with the National Electric Safety Code and such other standards practiced by the industry in a manner sufficient to provide safe and reliable service to all customers connected to the system consistent with this title and the commission's regulations. In performing such duties, the electric distribution company shall implement procedures to require all electric generation suppliers to deliver energy to the electric distribution company at locations and in amounts which are adequate to meet the energy supplier's obligations to its customers. Subject to commission approval, the electric distribution company may require that the customer install, at the customer's expense, enhanced metering capability sufficient to match the energy delivered by the electric generation suppliers with consumption by the customer. (b) Procedures for review by the commission.-- There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the electric distribution company has the ability to receive energy at all points on its system sufficient to meet the needs of all electric generation suppliers' customers on its system. The electric distribution company shall not have an obligation to install nonstandard facilities, either as to type or location, for the purpose of receiving energy from the energy supplier unless the energy supplier or its customer pays the full cost of these facilities. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the electric distribution company from upgrading its system to meet changing customer requirements consistent with the requirements of section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities), and the commission may establish incentive programs to encourage such system upgrades. Disputes concerning facilities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission and may be initiated by the filing of a complaint under section 701 (relating to complaints) by the electric generation supplier or the customer. (c) Customer billing.-- Subject to the right of an end-use customer to choose to receive separate bills from its electric generation supplier, the electric distribution company may be responsible for billing customers for all electric services, consistent with the regulations of the commission, regardless of the identity of the provider of those services. (1) Customer bills shall contain unbundled charges sufficient to enable the customer to determine the basis for those charges. (2) If services are provided by an entity other than the electric distribution company, the entity that provides those services shall furnish to the electric distribution company billing data sufficient to enable the electric distribution company to bill customers. (3) The electric distribution company shall not be required to forward payment to entities providing services to customers, and on whose behalf the electric distribution company is billing those customers, before the electric distribution company has received payment for those services from customers. (d) Consumer protections and customer service.-- The electric distribution company shall continue to provide customer service functions consistent with the regulations of the commission, including meter reading, complaint resolution and collections. Customer services shall, at a minimum, be maintained at the same level of quality under retail competition. (1) The commission shall establish regulations to ensure that an electric distribution company does not change a customer's electricity supplier without direct oral confirmation from the customer of record or written evidence of the customer's consent to a change of supplier. (2) The commission shall establish regulations to require each electric distribution company, electricity supplier, marketer, aggregator and broker to provide adequate and accurate customer information to enable customers to make informed choices regarding the purchase of all electricity services offered by that provider. Information shall be provided to consumers in an understandable format that enables consumers to compare prices and services on a uniform basis. (3) Prior to the implementation of any restructuring plan under section 2806 (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates), each electric distribution company, in conjunction with the commission, shall implement a consumer education program informing customers of the changes in the electric utility industry. The program shall provide consumers with information necessary to help them make appropriate choices as to their electric service. The education program shall be subject to approval by the commission. (e) Obligation to serve.-- A default service provider's obligation to provide electric generation supply service following the expiration of a generation rate cap specified under section 2804(4) (relating to standards for restructuring of electric industry) or a restructuring plan under section 2806(f) is revised as follows: (1) While an electric distribution company collects either a competitive transition charge or an intangible transition charge or until 100% of its customers have choice, whichever is longer, the electric distribution company shall continue to have the full obligation to serve, including the connection of customers, the delivery of electric energy and the production or acquisition of electric energy for customers. (2) (Deleted by amendment). (3) (Deleted by amendment). (3.1) Following the expiration of an electric distribution company's obligation to provide electric generation supply service to retail customers at capped rates, if a customer contracts for electric generation supply service and the chosen electric generation supplier does not provide the service or if a customer does not choose an alternative electric generation supplier, the default service provider shall provide electric generation supply service to that customer pursuant to a commission-approved competitive procurement plan. The electric power acquired shall be procured through competitive procurement processes and shall include one or more of the following: (i) Auctions. (ii) Requests for proposal. (iii) Bilateral agreements entered into at the sole discretion of the default service provider which shall be at prices which are: (A) no greater than the cost of obtaining generation under comparable terms in the wholesale market, as determined by the commission at the time of execution of the contract; or (B) consistent with a commission-approved competition procurement process. Any agreement between affiliated parties shall be subject to review and approval of the commission under Chapter 21 (relating to relations with affiliated interests). In no case shall the cost of obtaining generation from any affiliated interest be greater than the cost of obtaining generation under comparable terms in the wholesale market at the time of execution of the contract. (3.2) The electric power procured pursuant to paragraph (3.1) shall include a prudent mix of the following: (i) Spot market purchases. (ii) Short-term contracts. (iii) Long-term purchase contracts, entered into as a result of an auction, request for proposal or bilateral contract that is free of undue influence, duress or favoritism, of more than four and not more than 20 years. The default service provider shall have sole discretion to determine the source and fuel type. Long-term purchase contracts under this subparagraph may not constitute more than 25% of the default service provider's projected default service load unless the commission, after a hearing, determines for good cause that a greater portion of load is necessary to achieve least cost procurement. This subparagraph shall not apply to contracts executed under paragraph (5). (3.3) The commission may determine that a contract is required to be extended for a longer term of up to 20 years, if the extension is necessary to ensure adequate and reliable service at least cost to customers over time. (3.4) The prudent mix of contracts entered into pursuant to paragraphs (3.2) and (3.3) shall be designed to ensure: (i) Adequate and reliable service. (ii) The least cost to customers over time. (iii) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (3.1). (3.5) Except as set forth in paragraph (5)(ii), the provisions of this section shall apply to any type of energy purchased by a default service provider to provide electric generation supply service, including energy or alternative energy portfolio standards credits required to be purchased under the act of November 30, 2004 (P.L.1672, No.213), known as the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act. The commission shall apply paragraph (3.4) to comparable types of energy sources. (3.6) The default service provider shall file a plan for competitive procurement with the commission and obtain commission approval of the plan considering the standards in paragraphs (3.1), (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4) before the competitive process is implemented. The commission shall hold hearings as necessary on the proposed plan. If the commission fails to issue a final order on the plan within nine months of the date that the plan is filed, the plan shall be deemed to be approved and the default service provider may implement the plan as filed. Costs incurred through an approved competitive procurement plan shall be deemed to be the least cost over time as required under paragraph (3.4)(ii). (3.7) At the time the commission evaluates the plan and prior to approval, in determining if the default electric service provider's plan obtains generation supply at the least cost, the commission shall consider the default service provider's obligation to provide adequate and reliable service to customers and that the default service provider has obtained a prudent mix of contracts to obtain least cost on a long-term, short-term and spot market basis and shall make specific findings which shall include the following: (i) The default service provider's plan includes prudent steps necessary to negotiate favorable generation supply contracts. (ii) The default service provider's plan includes prudent steps necessary to obtain least cost generation supply contracts on a long-term, short-term and spot market basis. (iii) Neither the default service provider nor its affiliated interest has withheld from the market any generation supply in a manner that violates Federal law. (3.8) Notwithstanding sections 508 (relating to power of the commission to vary, reform and revise contracts) and 2102 (relating to approval of contracts with affiliated interests), the commission may modify contracts or disallow costs only when the party seeking recovery of the costs of a procurement plan is, after hearing, found to be at fault for the following: (i) not complying with the commission-approved procurement plan; or (ii) the commission of fraud, collusion or market manipulation with regard to these contracts. (3.9) The default service provider shall have the right to recover on a full and current basis, pursuant to a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments), all reasonable costs incurred under this section and a commission-approved competitive procurement plan. (4) If a customer that chooses an alternative supplier and subsequently desires to return to the local distribution company for generation service, the local distribution company shall treat that customer exactly as it would any new applicant for energy service. (5) (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (3.1), the electric distribution company or commission-approved alternative supplier may, in its sole discretion, offer large customers with a peak demand of 15 megawatts or greater at one meter at a location in its service territory any negotiated rate for service at all of the customers' locations within the service territory for any duration agreed upon by the electric distribution company or commission-approved alternative supplier and the large customer. The commission shall permit, but shall not require, an electric distribution company or commission-approved alternative supplier to provide service to large customers under this paragraph. Contract rates entered into under this paragraph shall be subject to review by the commission in order to ensure that all costs related to the rates are borne by the parties to the contract and that no costs related to the rates are borne by other customers or customer classes. If no costs related to the rates are borne by other customers or customer classes, the commission shall approve the contract within 90 days of its filing, or it shall be deemed approved by operation of law upon expiration of the 90 days. Information submitted under this paragraph shall be subject to the commission's procedures for the filing of confidential and proprietary information. (ii) For purposes of providing service under this paragraph to customers with a peak demand of 20 megawatts or greater at one meter at a location within that distribution company's service territory, an electric distribution company that has completed its restructuring transition period as of the effective date of this paragraph may, in its sole discretion, acquire an interest in a generation facility or construct a generation facility specifically to meet the energy requirements of the customers, including the electric requirements of the customers' other billing locations within its service territory. The electric distribution company must commence construction of the generation facility or contract to acquire the generation interest within three years after the effective date of this paragraph, except that the electric distribution company may add to the generation facilities it commenced construction or contracted to acquire after this three-year period to serve additional load of customers for whom it commenced construction or contracted to acquire generation within three years. Nothing in this paragraph requires or authorizes the commission to require an electric distribution company to commence construction or acquire an interest in a generation facility. The electric distribution company's interest in the generation facility it built or contracted to acquire shall be no larger than necessary to meet peak demand of customers served under this subparagraph. During times when the customer's demand is less than the electric distribution company's generation interest, the electric distribution company may sell excess power on the wholesale market. At no time shall the costs associated with the generating facility interests be included in rate base or otherwise reflected in rates. The generation facility interests shall not be commission-regulated assets. (6) A default service plan approved by the commission prior to the effective date of this section shall remain in effect through its approved term. At its sole discretion, the default service provider may propose amendments to its approved plan that are consistent with this section, and the commission shall issue a decision whether to approve or disapprove the proposed amendments within nine months of the date that the amendments are filed. If the commission fails to issue a final order within nine months, the amendments shall be deemed to be approved and the default service provider may implement the amendments as filed. (7) The default service provider shall offer residential and small business customers a generation supply service rate that shall change no more frequently than on a quarterly basis. All default service rates shall be reviewed by the commission to ensure that the costs of providing service to each customer class are not subsidized by any other class. (f) Smart meter technology and time of use rates.-- (1) Within nine months after the effective date of this paragraph, electric distribution companies shall file a smart meter technology procurement and installation plan with the commission for approval. The plan shall describe the smart meter technologies the electric distribution company proposes to install in accordance with paragraph (2). (2) Electric distribution companies shall furnish smart meter technology as follows: (i) Upon request from a customer that agrees to pay the cost of the smart meter at the time of the request. (ii) In new building construction. (iii) In accordance with a depreciation schedule not to exceed 15 years. (3) Electric distribution companies shall, with customer consent, make available direct meter access and electronic access to customer meter data to third parties, including electric generation suppliers and providers of conservation and load management services. (4) In no event shall lost or decreased revenues by an electric distribution company due to reduced electricity consumption or shifting energy demand be considered any of the following: (i) A cost of smart meter technology recoverable under a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307(b), except that decreased revenues and reduced energy consumption may be reflected in the revenue and sales data used to calculate rates in a distribution rate base rate proceeding filed under section 1308 (relating to voluntary changes in rates). (ii) A recoverable cost. (5) By January 1, 2010, or at the end of the applicable generation rate cap period, whichever is later, a default service provider shall submit to the commission one or more proposed time-of-use rates and real-time price plans. The commission shall approve or modify the time-of-use rates and real-time price plan within six months of submittal. The default service provider shall offer the time-of-use rates and real-time price plan to all customers that have been provided with smart meter technology under paragraph (2)(iii). Residential or commercial customers may elect to participate in time-of-use rates or real-time pricing. The default service provider shall submit an annual report to the price programs and the efficacy of the programs in affecting energy demand and consumption and the effect on wholesale market prices. (6) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to an electric distribution company with 100,000 or fewer customers. (7) An electric distribution company may recover reasonable and prudent costs of providing smart meter technology under paragraph (2)(ii) and (iii), as determined by the commission. This paragraph includes annual depreciation and capital costs over the life of the smart meter technology and the cost of any system upgrades that the electric distribution company may require to enable the use of the smart meter technology which are incurred after the effective date of this paragraph, less operating and capital cost savings realized by the electric distribution company from the installation and use of the smart meter technology. Smart meter technology shall be deemed to be a new service offered for the first time under section 2804(4)(vi). An electric distribution company may recover smart meter technology costs: (i) through base rates, including a deferral for future base rate recovery of current basis with carrying charge as determined by the commission; or (ii) on a full and current basis through a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"smart meter technology\" means technology, including metering technology and network communications technology capable of bidirectional communication, that records electricity usage on at least an hourly basis, including related electric distribution system upgrades to enable the technology. The technology shall provide customers with direct access to and use of price and consumption information. The technology shall also: (1) Directly provide customers with information on their hourly consumption. (2) Enable time-of-use rates and real-time price programs. (3) Effectively support the automatic control of the customer's electricity consumption by one or more of the following as selected by the customer: (i) the customer; (ii) the customer's utility; or (iii) a third party engaged by the customer or the customer's utility.

(a) License requirement.-- No person or corporation, including municipal corporations which choose to provide service outside their municipal limits except to the extent provided prior to the effective date of this chapter, brokers and marketers, aggregators and other entities, shall engage in the business of an electric generation supplier in this Commonwealth unless the person or corporation holds a license issued by the commission. Consistent with 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 (relating to generation choice for customers of electric cooperatives), electric cooperative corporations must possess a certificate for service to supply generation services beyond their territorial limits. (b) License application and issuance.-- An application for an electric generation supplier license must be made to the commission in writing, be verified by oath or affirmation and be in such form and contain such information as the commission may by its regulations require. A license shall be issued to any qualified applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the service covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing and able to perform properly the service proposed and to conform to the provisions of this title and the lawful orders and regulations of the commission under this title, including the commission's regulations regarding standards and billing practices, and that the proposed service, to the extent authorized by the license, will be consistent with the public interest and the policy declared in this chapter; otherwise, such application shall be denied. (c) Financial responsibility.-- (1) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the generation of electricity in this Commonwealth, no energy supplier license shall be issued or remain in force unless the holder complies with all of the following: (i) Furnishes a bond or other security approved by the commission in form and amount to ensure the financial responsibility of the electric generation supplier and the supply of electricity at retail in accordance with contracts, agreements or arrangements. (ii) Certifies to the commission that it will pay and in subsequent years has paid the full amount of taxes imposed by Articles II and XI of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971, and any tax imposed by this chapter. (iii) Provides the commission with the address of the participant's principal office in this Commonwealth or the address of the participant's registered agent in this Commonwealth, the latter being the address at which the participant may be served process. (iv) Agrees that it shall be subject to all taxes imposed by the Tax Reform Code of 1971 and any tax imposed by this chapter. Failure of an electricity supplier to pay a tax referred to in this paragraph or to otherwise comply with the provisions of this paragraph shall be cause for the commission to revoke the license of the electricity supplier. (2) If an electricity supplier other than an electric distribution company does not pay the tax imposed upon gross receipts under section 1101 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 or this chapter, the electric distribution company to whose retail customer the electricity supplier provided generation service shall remit the unpaid tax, as a tax on the use of electricity in this Commonwealth, to the Department of Revenue and may collect or seek reimbursement of the tax so paid from the electricity provider or any other appropriate party that used the electricity in this Commonwealth. The department shall collect and enforce the use tax herein provided under section 1102 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. Failure of the electric distribution company to pay the amount within 30 days after notice provided by the department shall cause interest to be imposed on the electric distribution company in accordance with Article XI of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. Interest shall be calculated from the 31st day after the department gives the notice required in this paragraph. An electric distribution company or other appropriate person may challenge the imposition of the tax and interest by filing a petition with the department not later than 30 days after the date on which the tax became due. (d) Transferability of licenses.-- No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without prior commission approval. (e) Form of regulation of electric generation suppliers.-- The commission may forbear from applying requirements of this part which it determines are unnecessary due to competition among electric generation suppliers. In regulating the service of electric generation suppliers, the commission shall impose requirements necessary to ensure that the present quality of service provided by electric utilities does not deteriorate, including assuring that adequate reserve margins of electric supply are maintained and assuring that 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service) are maintained. (f) Availability of the services of brokers and marketers or aggregators.-- Prior to approving the licensure of any broker and marketer or aggregator, the commission shall set forth standards to ensure that all retail customer classes may choose to purchase electricity through a broker and marketer or aggregator. The commission shall also ensure that brokers, marketers and aggregators comply with 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56. (g) Annual fees.-- The commission may establish, by order or rule, on a reasonable cost basis, fees to be charged for annual activities related to the oversight of electric generation suppliers.

      "text": "§ 2810. Revenue-neutral reconciliation. (a) General intent of revenue-neutral reconciliation.-- It is the intention of the General Assembly that the restructuring of the electric industry be accomplished in a manner that allows Pennsylvania to enjoy the benefits of competition, promotes the competitiveness of Pennsylvania's electric utilities and maintains revenue neutrality to the Commonwealth. This section is not intended to cause a shift in proportional tax obligations among customer classes or individual electric distribution companies. It is the intention of the General Assembly to establish this revenue replacement at a level necessary to recoup losses that may result from the restructuring of the electric industry and the transition thereto. (b) Imposition.-- (1) For tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 1999, a tax at the rate provided in subsection (c) is imposed upon the gross receipts of electric distribution companies and electric generation suppliers. (2) A tax at the rate provided in subsection (c) is imposed upon the gross receipts of any municipality owned or operated public utility or of any public utility service furnished by any municipality. Gross receipts shall be exempt from the tax to the extent that gross receipts are derived from sales of electric energy inside the limits of the municipality owning or operating the public utility or furnishing the public utility service. (3) A tax at the rate provided in subsection (c) is imposed upon the gross receipts derived from any electric cooperative owned or operated public utility or from any public utility service furnished by any electric cooperative. Gross receipts shall be exempt from the tax to the extent that gross receipts are derived from sales for resale or sales of electric energy within the limits of its service territory as set forth in 15 Pa.C.S. § 7406 (relating to competition by electric cooperatives). (c) Rate.-- (1) By December 1, 1998, and each October 1 thereafter until and including October 1, 2002, the Secretary of Revenue shall publish the rate of tax as provided in paragraph (2) in the form of a notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and the rate shall apply to the tax imposed by subsection (b) for the period beginning the next January 1. The tax rate published on October 1, 2002, shall continue in force without further adjustment. If the commission determines under section 2806(c) (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates) to extend the transition period by more than six months, the requirement for an annual adjustment of the tax rate shall be extended by one additional year. The secretary shall also certify the rate calculated to the majority and minority chairs of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate and the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives and detail the calculations of the rate. (2) The secretary shall calculate the rate for the periods beginning on and after January 1, 1999, in the manner set forth in this paragraph: (i) Multiply the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total kilowatt hours of electricity distributed for ultimate consumption in Pennsylvania in the preceding calendar year as certified by the commission and the denominator of which is the total kilowatt hours of electricity distributed for ultimate consumption in Pennsylvania in the calendar year 1995 as certified by the commission. (ii) From the product derived under subparagraph (i), subtract the total cash payments made to the department during the Commonwealth's preceding fiscal year on account of affected taxes actually paid by each electric distribution company and electric generation supplier and by any other entity, including a successor, whose affected taxes are contained in the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base. (iii) Divide the difference derived under subparagraph (ii) by the total gross receipts in the preceding calendar year as certified by the commission to determine the tax rate. The tax rate under this subparagraph shall be a decimal rounded to three places. (3) On August 1, 2000, August 1, 2001, and August 1, 2002, the department shall deliver a report to the General Assembly and the Governor that shall describe the dynamic economic effect upon the affected taxes due to electric utility restructuring. It is the purpose of this report to provide the General Assembly and the Governor with information to determine whether it is appropriate to consider modifying the calculation described in paragraph (2) to reflect additional tax revenues, if any, resulting from the dynamic economic effects upon the affected taxes. (4) If the effective rate for any affected tax is different from the effective rate for such affected tax in the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base, an adjustment shall be made to the computation of the rate of tax under paragraph (2) by multiplying that portion of the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base attributable to the affected tax by a fraction, the numerator of which is the effective rate of the affected tax for the preceding fiscal year and the denominator of which is the effective rate of tax of the affected tax in the base fiscal year. (5) For negative rates: (i) If the rate of tax calculated for a tax year prior to the tax year beginning January 1, 2004, or January 1, 2005, in the event of an extension by more than six months by the commission as provided in section 2806(c) is negative, a credit equal to the negative tax rate for such tax year multiplied by the taxable gross receipts for that tax year shall be allowed against the taxpayer's liability for any tax for that tax year imposed under Article XI of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971. (ii) If the rate of tax calculated as the final adjustment is negative for the tax period beginning January 1, 2003, or January 1, 2004, in the event of an extension by more than six months by the commission as provided in section 2806(c), the rate of tax imposed by section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 for the tax years beginning January 1, 2004, and thereafter, or January 1, 2005, and thereafter, in the event of an extension by more than six months, shall be adjusted and set as follows: the tax rate expressed as a decimal rounded to three positions shall be subtracted from .044 or the current rate imposed under section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 to determine the adjusted tax rate. The adjusted tax rate shall be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. (6) Information to be provided to the department or the commission shall be as follows: (i) To ensure the identification of cash payments for purposes of subsection (d), the commission shall require any licensee, electric distribution company, electric generation supplier or other person affected to disclose on its license application, renewal or transfer its State tax account or similar number relative to any of the taxes specified. (ii) The commission shall report and certify to the secretary of the department by August 1, 1998, and each August 1 thereafter the total amount of electricity distributed for ultimate consumption in this Commonwealth during the previous two calendar years and the total gross receipts for the past year. (iii) As a condition of licensure, the commission shall require each electric distribution company and electric generation supplier to report their annual gross receipts in this Commonwealth. (iv) For purposes of enforcing sections 2806 and 2809 (relating to requirements for electric generation suppliers) as they relate to the payment of State taxes, an applicant for the grant, renewal or transfer of a license issued under this title shall, by filing an application with the commission, waive confidentiality with respect to State tax information regarding the applicant in the possession of the department, regardless of the source of the information, and shall consent to the department providing that information to the commission. (7) (Repealed). (d) Payment of tax and reports.-- The tax imposed under subsection (b) shall be paid within the time prescribed by law. For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the tax, the treasurer or other appropriate officer of the taxpayer shall transmit to the department by March 15 an annual report, and under oath or affirmation, of the amount of gross receipts received by the taxpayer during the prior calendar year. The treasurer or other appropriate officer of the taxpayer liable to report or pay taxes imposed under subsection (b), except municipalities and cooperatives, shall transmit to the department by March 15 a tentative report for the prior calendar year. The tentative report shall set forth all of the following: (i) The amount of gross receipts received in the period of 12 months next preceding and reported in the annual report. (ii) The gross receipts received in the first three months of the current calendar year. (iii) Other information as the department may require. (e) Tax computation.-- Upon the date its tentative report is required to be made, the taxpayer making a tentative report shall transmit the report to the department on account of the tax due for the current calendar year and compute and make payment of the tentative tax with the report under section 3003 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. (f) Time to file reports.-- The time for filing annual reports may be extended, estimated settlements may be made by the department if reports are not filed, and the penalties for failing to file reports and pay the taxes imposed under subsection (b) shall be as prescribed by the laws defining the powers and duties of the department. If the works of a taxpayer are operated by another taxpayer, the taxes imposed under subsection (b) shall be apportioned between the taxpayers in accordance with the terms of their respective leases or agreements. For the payment of the apportioned taxes, the Commonwealth shall first look to the taxpayer operating the works. Upon payment by that taxpayer, no other taxpayer shall be held liable for any tax imposed under subsection (b). (g) Timely mailing treated as timely filing and payment.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of any State tax law to the contrary, whenever payment of all or any portion of a State tax is required by law to be received by the department or other agency of the Commonwealth by a day certain, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have complied with that law if the letter transmitting payment of the tax which has been received by the department is postmarked by the United States Postal Service on or prior to the final day on which the payment is to be received. (h) Procedure, enforcement and penalties.-- Parts III, IV, VI and VII of Article IV and Article XXX of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 shall apply to this section insofar as they are consistent with this section and applicable to the tax imposed under subsection (b). Notwithstanding the provisions of section 403(d) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, if the officers of any corporation subject to tax under this chapter neglect or refuse to make a report as required in this chapter or knowingly make a false report, the department shall add to the tax determined to be due a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due for each month or fraction of a month until the penalty has reached 25% and thereafter a penalty of 1% of the amount of tax due for each month or fraction of a month. Penalties added to the tax shall not bear interest. (i) Electric light, waterpower and hydroelectric utilities.-- The terms \"electric light company,\" \"waterpower company\" and \"hydro-electric company,\" as used in section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, shall be deemed to include electric distribution companies and electric generation suppliers. (j) Sales of electric energy.-- Retail sales of electric generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electric energy, dispatching services, customer services, competitive transition charges, intangible transition charges and universal service and energy conservation charges and such other retail sales in this Commonwealth the receipts of which, if bundled, would have been deemed to be sales of electric energy prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be deemed sales of electric energy for purposes of section 1101 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. The phrases \"doing business in this Commonwealth\" and \"engaged in electric light and power business, waterpower business and hydro-electric business in this Commonwealth,\" as such terms are used in section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 and in this chapter, shall be construed to include the direct or indirect engaging in, transacting or conducting of activity in this Commonwealth for the purpose of establishing or maintaining a market for the sales of electric energy and include obtaining a license or certification from the commission to supply electric energy. Retail sales of generation shall be deemed to occur at the meter of the retail consumer. (k) Electric cooperatives.-- Section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 shall apply to electric cooperatives and impose a tax upon the gross receipts derived from any electric cooperative owned or operated public utility or from any public utility service furnished by any electric cooperative. Gross receipts shall be exempt from the tax to the extent that the gross receipts are derived from sales for resale or sales of electric energy within the limits of its service territory as set forth in 15 Pa.C.S. § 7406. (l) Provisions to be construed with utilities gross receipts tax.-- Subsections (i), (j) and (k) shall be construed in conjunction with Article XI of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 and shall be effective for tax years beginning January 1, 1997, and thereafter. (m) Indemnification.-- The electric distribution utility company's tariff shall provide that, if an electric distribution company becomes liable under sections 2806(g) and 2809(c) for State taxes not paid by an electric generation supplier, that electric generation supplier shall indemnify the electric distribution company for the amount of the liability so imposed upon the electric distribution utility. (n) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Affected taxes.\" The taxes imposed under Articles II, IV, VI and XI and section 2301(f) of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971. \"Base fiscal year.\" The year beginning on July 1, 1995, and ending on June 30, 1996. \"Department.\" The Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth. \"Effective rate.\" The tax rate applicable during the fiscal year or, if more than one rate is applicable, the average of the rates that were in effect for each month of the fiscal year. \"Fiscal year.\" A year beginning on July 1 and ending on the subsequent June 30. \"Gross receipts.\" The gross receipts from the retail sales of electric energy as defined in section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. \"1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base.\" The receipts from affected taxes from the fiscal year 1995-1996, such amount being $984,141,837. \"Portion of the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base attributable to the affected tax.\" The following amounts for the tax indicated: Tax Amount Corporate net income tax $181,628,433 Capital stock-franchise tax $117,495,605 Sales and use tax $187,401,632 Public utility realty tax $ 43,883,573 Utilities gross receipts tax $453,732,594 \"Total utilities gross receipts.\" The total gross receipts for a calendar year for all electric distribution companies and electric generation suppliers which are derived from the sales of electric energy and required to be reported to the commission under subsection (c)(6)(iii).

      "text": "§ 2812. Approval of transition bonds. (a) Qualified rate orders.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission is authorized to issue qualified rate orders in accordance with the provisions of this subsection to facilitate the recovery or financing of qualified transition expenses of an electric utility or assignee. (1) A qualified rate order may be adopted by the commission only upon the application of an electric utility and shall become effective in accordance with its terms. After the issuance of a qualified rate order, the electric utility retains sole discretion regarding whether to assign, sell or otherwise transfer intangible transition property or to cause the transition bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such assignment, sale, transfer or issuance. (2) After the effective date of this chapter, an electric utility may file an application for a qualified rate order pursuant to the following procedures: (i) Each application for a qualified rate order shall contain a complete accounting of the utility's transition or stranded costs, detailed information regarding the utility's proposal for the sale of intangible transition property or the issuance of transition bonds and information regarding the electric utility's planned use of the proceeds of the sale or issuance. After the utility has filed its restructuring plan under section 2806 (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates), the utility may incorporate by reference the information in the restructuring plan in providing the information. (ii) An electric utility may file an application for a qualified rate order concurrently with, prior to, during or following the filing of its restructuring plan under section 2806. If an electric utility requests expedited review under subsection (b)(1)(i) or (ii), it shall designate in its application the portion of its total claimed transition or stranded costs for which it requests such expedited review. (iii) After notice and an opportunity to be heard, the commission may issue a final qualified rate order for all or a portion of the amount of transition or stranded costs that it finds would be just and reasonable for the utility to recover from ratepayers under sections 2804 (relating to standards for restructuring of electric industry) and 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge). The commission shall issue a final qualified rate order only for the amounts for which it finds such issuance to be in the public interest. The commission shall complete its review of the application and issue its final determination by the later of nine months from the filing, unless the electric utility requests expedited treatment under subsection (b), or 15 days following the filing of the electric utility's restructuring plan under section 2806. (b) Expedited review procedures.-- (1) The commission shall provide for expedited review of applications for qualified rate orders upon request of the electric utility pursuant to the following procedures: (i) If the utility elects to file an application prior to the filing of its restructuring plan and requests expedited review, the commission, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, may issue a final qualified rate order approving the issuance of transition bonds for a portion of the utility's transition or stranded costs that the commission finds would be just and reasonable to recover from ratepayers under sections 2804 and 2808. The commission shall consider only the portion of the transition or stranded costs for which the utility requests approval to issue transition bonds. Consideration of all remaining amounts and amounts not resolved by the commission shall be deferred for consideration in the electric utility's restructuring plan proceeding under section 2806. The commission shall complete its review of the application and issue its final determination within 120 days after the request for expedited review but in no event earlier than 15 days after the utility has filed its restructuring plan under section 2806. (ii) If the electric utility files an application for a qualified rate order concurrently with its restructuring plan or during the course of the restructuring plan proceeding, the electric utility may request, and the commission may allow, an accelerated determination of the application. After notice and an opportunity to be heard, the commission may issue a final qualified rate order approving the issuance of transition bonds for a portion of the utility's stranded or transition costs that the commission finds would be just and reasonable to recover from ratepayers under sections 2804 and 2808. The commission shall consider only the portion of the utility's transition or stranded costs for which the utility seeks expedited review. Consideration of all remaining amounts and amounts not resolved by the commission shall be deferred for consideration in a final order regarding the utility's restructuring plan under section 2806. The commission shall complete its review of the application and issue its final determination within 120 days after the request for expedited review. (iii) If the electric utility files an application for a qualified rate order after the commission enters a final order regarding the utility's restructuring plan, and requests expedited treatment, the commission shall complete its review and issue its final determination within 120 days of the request for expedited review. (2) The qualified rate order shall require that the proceeds from the assignment, sale or transfer or other financing of intangible transition property shall be used principally to reduce the electric utility's transition or stranded costs and to reduce the related capitalization, pursuant to a plan submitted by the electric utility in its application for a qualified rate order and approved by the commission. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission has the power to specify that all or a portion of a qualified rate order shall be irrevocable. To the extent so specified, neither the order nor the intangible transition charges authorized to be imposed and collected under the order shall be subject to reduction, postponement, impairment or termination by any subsequent action of the commission. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to supersede the right of any party to judicial review of the qualified rate order. (4) The commission shall provide in any qualified rate order for a procedure for the expeditious approval by the commission of periodic adjustments to the intangible transition charges that are the subject of the pertinent qualified rate order. Such adjustments shall ensure the recovery of revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of principal, interest, acquisition or redemption premium and for other fees, costs and charges in respect of transition bonds approved by the commission as part of or in conjunction with a qualified rate order. The commission shall determine whether the adjustments are required on each anniversary of the issuance of the qualified rate order and at the additional intervals as may be provided for in the qualified rate order. The adjustments, if required, shall be approved within 90 days of each anniversary of the issuance of the qualified rate order or of each additional interval provided for in the qualified rate order. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on such conditions as the commission may approve, all or portions of the interest of an electric utility in intangible transition property may be assigned, sold or transferred to an assignee and may be pledged or assigned as security by an electric utility or assignee to or for the benefit of a financing party. To the extent that an interest is assigned, sold or transferred or is pledged or assigned as security, the commission shall authorize the electric utility to contract with the assignee or financing party that the electric utility will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will impose and collect the applicable intangible transition charges for the benefit and account of the assignee or financing party and will account for and remit the applicable intangible transition charge to or for the account of the assignee or financing party. If the qualified rate order so provides, the obligations of the electric utility: (i) shall be binding upon the electric utility, its successors and assigns; and (ii) shall be required by the commission to be undertaken and performed by the electric utility and any other entity which provides electric service to a person that was a customer of an electric utility located within the certificated territory of the electric utility on the effective date of this chapter or that became a customer of electric services within such territory after the effective date of this chapter and is still located within such territory, as a condition to the provision of service to such customer by such electric utility or other entity, unless the customer has paid a termination charge in the manner and on the basis specified in the qualified rate order. (6) The irrevocable status of any portion of a qualified rate order under paragraph (3) shall lapse and terminate to the extent that an assignment, sale or transfer of the intangible transition property resulting from the rate order or the issuance of the related transition bonds is not effected within the period specified in the qualified rate order. (7) The effect of any subsequent refinancing of transition bonds upon the rates authorized in a qualified rate order shall be as provided in such order. (8) In its qualified rate order, the commission shall afford flexibility in establishing the terms and conditions of the transition bonds, including repayment schedules, interest rates and other financing costs. The electric utility shall file the final terms of issuance with the commission. (c) Intangible transition property.-- (1) Any right that an electric utility has in the intangible transition property prior to its sale or transfer or any other right created under this section or created in the qualified rate order and assignable under this section or assignable pursuant to a qualified rate order shall be only a contract right. (2) The Commonwealth pledges to and agrees with the holders of any transition bonds issued under this section and with any assignee or financing party who may enter into contracts with an electric utility under this section that the Commonwealth will not limit or alter or in any way impair or reduce the value of intangible transition property or intangible transition charges approved by a qualified rate order until the transition bonds and interest on the transition bonds are fully paid and discharged or the contracts are fully performed on the part of the electric utility. Subject to other requirements of law, nothing in this paragraph shall preclude limitation or alteration if adequate compensation is made by law for the full protection of the intangible transition charges collected pursuant to a qualified rate order and of the holder of this transition bond and any assignee or financing party entering into contract with the electric utility. (d) Security interests in intangible transition property.-- (1) Neither intangible transition property nor any right, title or interest of a utility or assignee described in paragraph (1) of the definition of \"intangible transition property\" in subsection (g), whether before or after the issuance of the qualified rate order, shall constitute \"an account\" or \"general intangibles\" under 13 Pa.C.S. § 9102 (relating to definitions and index of definitions) nor shall any such right, title or interest pertaining to a qualified rate order, including the associated intangible transition property and any revenues, collections, claims, payments, money or proceeds of or arising from intangible transition charges pursuant to such order, be deemed proceeds of any right or interest other than in the order and the intangible transition property arising from the order. (2) The granting, perfection and enforcement of security interests in intangible transition property to secure transition bonds is governed by this section rather than by Title 13 (relating to commercial code). (3) A valid and enforceable security interest in intangible transition property shall attach and be perfected only by means of a separate filing with the commission, under regulations the commission prescribes. For this purpose: (i) If the transition bonds are issued to finance any qualified transition expenses, as specified in the applicable qualified rate order, the lien of the bonds shall attach automatically to the intangible transition property relating to the expenses from the time of issuance of the bonds. (ii) The lien under subparagraph (i) shall be deemed a valid and enforceable security interest in the intangible transition property securing the qualified transition bonds and shall be continuously perfected if, before the date of issuance specified in subparagraph (i) or within no more than ten days after the date, a filing has been made by or on behalf of the financing party to protect that security interest in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the commission under this subsection. Any filing in respect to such transition bonds shall take precedence over any other filing. (iii) The lien under subparagraph (i) is enforceable against the assignee and all third parties, including judicial lien creditors, subject only to the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the intangible transition property previously perfected in the manner described in this subsection if value has been given by the purchasers of transition bonds. A perfected lien in intangible transition property is a continuously perfected security interest in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect to the associated intangible transition property, whether or not revenues have accrued. Intangible transition property constitutes property for the purposes of contracts securing transition bonds, whether or not the related revenues have accrued. The lien created under this paragraph is perfected and ranks prior to any other lien, including any judicial lien, which subsequently attaches to the intangible transition property, to the intangible transition charges and to the qualified rate order and any rights created by the order or any proceeds of the order. The relative priority of a lien created under this paragraph is not defeated or adversely affected by changes to the qualified rate order or to the intangible transition charges payable by any customer. (iv) The relative priority of a lien created under this paragraph is not defeated or adversely affected by the commingling of revenues arising with respect to intangible transition property with funds of the electric utility or other funds of the assignee. (v) If an event of default occurs under approved transition bonds, the holders of transition bonds or their authorized representatives, as secured parties, may foreclose or otherwise enforce the lien in the intangible transition property securing the transition bonds, subject to the rights of any third parties holding prior security interests in the intangible transition property perfected in the manner provided in this subsection. Upon application by the holders or their representatives, without limiting their other remedies, the commission shall order the sequestration and payment to the holders or their representatives of revenues arising with respect to the intangible transition property pledged to the holders. An order under this subparagraph shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electric utility or assignee. (4) The commission shall establish and maintain a separate system of records to reflect the date and time of receipt of all filings made under this subsection and may provide that transfers of intangible transition property to an assignee be filed in accordance with the same system. (e) True sale.-- A transfer of intangible transition property by an electric utility to an assignee which the parties have in the governing documentation expressly stated to be a sale or other absolute transfer, in a transaction approved in a qualified rate order, shall be treated as an absolute transfer of all of the transferor's right, title and interest, as in a true sale, and not as a pledge or other financing, of the intangible transition property, other than for Federal and State income and franchise tax purposes. Granting to holders of transition bonds a preferred right to the intangible transition property or the provision by the electric utility of any credit enhancement with respect to transition bonds shall not impair or negate the characterization of any transfer as a true sale, other than for Federal and State income and franchise tax purposes. A transfer of intangible transition property shall be deemed perfected as against third persons, including any judicial lien creditors, when all of the following have taken place: (1) The commission has issued the qualified rate order creating intangible transition property. (2) A sale or transfer of the intangible transition property in writing has been executed and delivered to the assignee. (f) Actions with respect to intangible transition charges.-- (1) Nothing in this chapter shall entitle any person to bring an action against a retail electric customer for nonpayment of intangible transition charges, other than the electric utility, its successor or any other entity which provides electric service to a person that was a customer of an electric utility located within the certificated territory of the electric utility on the effective date of this chapter or that became a customer of electric services within such territory after the effective date of this chapter and is still located within such territory. (2) The commission has exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of the obligations to impose and collect intangible transition charges of an electric utility, its successor or any other entity which provides electric service to a person that was a customer of an electric utility located within the certificated territory of the electric utility on the effective date of this chapter or that became a customer of electric services within such territory after the effective date of this chapter and is still located within such territory. (g) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Assignee.\" An entity, including a corporation, public authority, trust or financing vehicle, to which an electric utility assigns, sells or transfers other than as security all or a portion of its interest in or right to intangible transition property.

      "text": "§ 3015. Alternative forms of regulation. (a) Inflation offset.-- (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a local exchange telecommunications company with an alternative form of regulation containing a price stability mechanism that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1), (2) or (3) (relating to network modernization plans) shall be subject to a modified inflation offset in its price stability mechanism in adjusting its rates for noncompetitive services, effective upon the filing of an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(e), as follows: (i) If a nonrural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2013, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be zero. (ii) If a nonrural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2015, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be equal to 0.5%. (iii) If a rural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2008, or under section 3014(b)(2)(ii)(A) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2013, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be zero. (iv) If a rural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(2)(ii)(B) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2015, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be equal to 0.5%. (2) Utilizing network modernization plan reports filed with the commission by local exchange telecommunications companies under section 3014(f), the commission shall monitor and enforce companies' compliance with their interim and final 100% commitments for broadband availability in their amended network modernization plans. In the event that a local exchange telecommunications company is found by the commission, after notice and evidentiary hearings held on an expedited basis, to have failed to meet such an interim or final 100% commitment, then the commission shall require the local exchange telecommunications company to refund to customers in its next price stability filing an amount that is just and reasonable under the circumstances. Such amount shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the percentage shortfall of the broadband availability commitment on an access-line basis required to be met during the period from the start of the amended plan or from the date of the last prior interim commitment, as applicable, times the increased revenue that was obtained during this period as a result of the modified inflation offset provided in this section that reduced the inflation offset applicable in the local exchange telecommunications company's alternative regulation plan in effect on the effective date of this section, plus interest calculated under section 1308(d) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). Any such refund required under this subsection shall be separate from and in addition to any civil or other penalties that the commission may impose on a local exchange telecommunications company under Chapter 33 (relating to violations and penalties). (3) Where annual rate adjustments made under a nonrural telecommunications carrier's price stability mechanism are calculated using revenues from protected services, an average rate adjustment for protected residential customer local exchange telecommunications service lines shall be determined by dividing the total protected service revenues associated with such lines, as adjusted by the price stability formula, by the number of such lines, and the rate adjustment for any individual line shall not vary from this average rate adjustment by more than 20%. (b) Rate changes for rural telecommunications carriers.-- (1) In addition to the rate change provisions in its alternative form of regulation plan, a rural telecommunications carrier operating without a price stability mechanism that files with the commission an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1) or (2) shall be permitted at any time to file proposed tariff changes with the commission, effective 45 days after filing, setting forth miscellaneous changes, including increases and decreases, in rates for noncompetitive services, excluding basic residential and business rates, provided such rate changes do not increase the rural telecommunications carrier's annual intrastate revenues by more than 3%. (2) The commission tariff filing requirements and review associated with such proposed rate changes shall be limited to schedules submitted by the rural telecommunications carrier detailing the impact of the rate changes on the carrier's annual intrastate revenues. (3) A rural telecommunications carrier that implements noncompetitive rate changes consistent with the procedure set forth in its alternative form of regulation plan shall be required only to file such financial and cost data with the commission to justify such changes as is required under its commission-approved alternative form of regulation plan. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), (2) or (3), for any rural telecommunications carrier serving less than 50,000 access lines in this Commonwealth and operating under an alternative form of regulation plan, a formal complaint to deny rate changes for noncompetitive services unless signed by at least 20 customers of the rural telecommunications carrier shall not prevent implementation of the rate changes pending the adjudication of the formal complaint by the commission. (c) Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund.-- (1) There is hereby established within the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund for the purposes enumerated in section 3014(i). (2) A local exchange telecommunications company that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(2) or (3) shall be assessed by the commission for contribution to the fund and to the E-fund established under subsection (d) an amount of 20% of the first year's annual revenue effect: (i) of any rate increase permitted by the elimination or reduction of the offset under subsection (a) and placed into effect; or (ii) of any rate increase placed into effect under subsection (b)(1) if the local exchange telecommunications company is operating without a price stability mechanism. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"first year's annual revenue effect\" means the projected or actual increased revenues received by the local exchange telecommunications company during the one-year period from the effective date of its rate increase. The commission shall begin the assessments provided for in this paragraph on June 30, 2005, and thereafter shall make such assessments annually on June 30 until June 30, 2010, for assessments that include amounts for the fund and the e-fund and until June 30, 2015, for assessments that include amounts for only the fund. Each assessment shall be based on the first year's annual revenue effect of any covered rate increase effective after the date of the last annual assessment. (3) An amount not to exceed 50% of such assessment shall be allocated to the fund. The remainder of the assessment shall be allocated to the E-fund provided for under subsection (d) until its termination on June 30, 2011. After the E-fund termination, the maximum assessment percentage shall be reduced from 20% to 10%, and contributions shall be made only to the fund until the local exchange telecommunications company achieves 100% broadband availability. Contributions of allocated amounts shall be paid to the fund and the E-fund by the local exchange telecommunications company in equal quarterly installments. (4) In no event shall the total amount of the fund exceed $5,000,000 annually, and in the event of such overfunding the department shall credit the overcollection to the next year's contribution amount. (5) A local exchange telecommunications company that elects to amend its network modernization plan pursuant to section 3014 (b)(1) shall not be required to contribute to the fund. (6) The moneys in the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund are hereby appropriated upon approval of the Governor to the department for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (1). The department may use up to 3% of the money in the fund for administration. (7) The fund shall continue until July 1, 2016, at which time the fund shall terminate, and the department shall return any funds remaining in the fund on a pro rata basis to the local exchange telecommunications companies that contributed to the fund. (d) Education Technology Fund (E-Fund).-- (1) There is hereby established within the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Education Technology Fund (E-Fund) for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (4). (2) All E-fund assessments imposed by the commission under subsection (c)(2) and paragraph (3), moneys specifically appropriated by the General Assembly for the purposes of this subsection and any funds, contributions or payments which may be made available to the fund by the Federal Government, another State agency or any public or private source for the purpose of implementing this subsection shall be deposited in the E-Fund. (3) Beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, the commission shall, no later than June 30, annually assess each nonrural telecommunications carrier that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) an amount to be deposited in the E-Fund. Each carrier's annual assessment shall be payable in two equal installments due on October 31 of each year and January 31 of the following year and shall be based on the relative proportion of the retail access lines served by the nonrural telecommunications carrier in relation to the number of retail access lines served by all nonrural telecommunications carriers that have filed an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3). For fiscal years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, the total annual assessment amount shall be $7,000,000. For fiscal years 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, the total annual assessment amount shall be the difference between $7,000,000 and any amount remaining in the E-Fund from prior fiscal years which remains unencumbered or unexpended. A nonrural telecommunications carrier's assessments required under this paragraph may not be recovered via a surcharge on customers' bills or in rates for noncompetitive services as exogenous change adjustment under the provisions of the carrier's price stability mechanism and subsection (a)(3) where applicable. (4) Additional local exchange telecommunications company contributions to the E-fund shall be made pursuant to the provisions of subsections (c)(2) and (3). (5) The Department of Education shall expend the moneys of the E-Fund for the purpose of providing grants to school entities as prescribed by section 3014(j). (6) The moneys of the Education Technology Fund are hereby appropriated upon approval of the Governor to the Department of Education for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (5). The Department of Education may use up to 3% of the money for administration. Appropriations by the General Assembly to the fund shall be continuing appropriations and shall not lapse at the close of any fiscal year. (7) The E-Fund shall continue until June 30, 2011, at which time the fund shall terminate and the Department of Education shall return any funds remaining therein on a pro rata basis to the local exchange telecommunications companies that contributed to the fund. (e) General filing requirements.-- The commission's filing and audit requirements for a local exchange telecommunications company that is operating under an amended network modernization plan shall be limited to the following: (1) Network modernization plan reports filed pursuant to section 3014(f). (2) An annual financial report consisting of a balance sheet and income statement. (3) An annual deaf, speech-impaired and hearing-impaired relay information report. (4) An annual service report. (5) Universal service reports. (6) An annual access line report. (7) An annual statement of gross intrastate operating revenues for purposes of calculating assessments for regulatory expenses. (8) An annual State tax adjustment computation for years in which a tax change has occurred, if applicable. (9) For those companies with a bona fide retail request program, a bona fide retail request report under section 3014(c)(9). These reports shall be submitted in the form determined by the commission. (f) Other reports.-- (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title to the contrary, no report, statement, filing or other document or information, except as specified in subsection (e), shall be required of any local exchange telecommunications company unless the commission, upon notice to the affected local exchange telecommunications company and an opportunity to be heard, has first made specific written findings supporting conclusions in an entered order that: (i) The report is necessary to ensure that the local exchange telecommunications company is charging rates that are in compliance with this chapter and its effective alternative form of regulation. (ii) The benefits of the report substantially outweigh the attendant expense and administrative time and effort required of the local exchange telecommunications company to prepare it. (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impede the ability of the commission to require the submission of further information to support the accuracy of or to seek an explanation of the reports specified in subsection (e). (g) Rate change limitations.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the requirement of section 1301 (relating to rates to be just and reasonable) that rates shall be just and reasonable. The annual rate change limitations set forth in a local exchange telecommunications company's effective commission-approved alternative form of regulation plan or any other commission-approved annual rate change limitation shall remain applicable and shall be deemed just and reasonable under section 1301. (h) Conformance of plan.-- Upon approval of a local exchange telecommunications company of network modernization plan amendments pursuant to section 3014(e), the local exchange telecommunications company's alternative form of regulation plan shall be deemed amended consistent with this section.

(10) Refrain from solicitation of funds for any political, educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic purposes, although he may be an officer, director or trustee of such organizations.

      "text": "§ 331. Powers of commission and administrative law judges. (a) General rule.-- The commission may, on its own motion and whenever it may be necessary in the performance of its duties, investigate and examine the condition and management of any public utility or any other person or corporation subject to this part. In conducting the investigations the commission may proceed, either with or without a hearing, as it may deem best, but it shall make no order without affording the parties affected thereby a hearing. Any investigation, inquiry or hearing which the commission has power to undertake or hold shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. (b) Assignment of proceedings; powers of chairman.-- All on-the-record proceedings shall be referred to an administrative law judge for decision except that in those proceedings involving a rate determination, safety matters, rulemaking procedures, unprotested applications or matters covered by section 335(a)(1) (relating to initial decisions), the commission may authorize the chairman to assign cases as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3); and, in addition, the commission may authorize the chairman to: (1) Designate the time and place for the conducting of investigations, inquiries and hearings. (2) Assign cases to a commissioner or commissioners for hearing, investigation, inquiry, study or other similar purposes. (3) Assign cases to special agents or administrative law judges for the taking and receiving of evidence. (4) Direct and designate officers and employees of the commission to make investigations, inspections, inquiries, studies and other like assignments for reports to the commission. (5) Be responsible through the secretary for specifically enumerated daily administrative operations of the commission. (c) Requirements for presiding officers.-- There shall preside at the taking of evidence the commission, one or more commissioners, or one or more administrative law judges appointed as provided in this chapter. The functions of all presiding officers shall be conducted in an impartial manner. Any such officer may at any time withdraw from a proceeding if he deems himself disqualified, and, upon the filing in good faith of a timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of any such officer, the commission shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the proceeding. (d) Authority of presiding officers.-- In addition to any administrative rules of procedure contained in this part, the commission may adopt and publish such additional rules of procedure as are not inconsistent with this part. Officers presiding at hearings shall have authority subject to the published rules of the commission and within its powers, to: (1) Administer oaths and affirmations. (2) Issue subpoenas authorized by law. (3) Rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence, take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of justice would be served thereby. (4) Regulate the course of the hearing. (5) Require persons requesting to make a statement at a public input hearing to state their name, occupation and place of employment for the record. (6) Hold conferences for settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties. (7) Dispose of procedural requests or similar matters. (8) Make decisions or recommend decisions in conformity within this part. (9) Take any other action authorized by commission rule. (e) Interlocutory appeals.-- A presiding officer may certify to the commission, or allow the parties an interlocutory appeal to the commission on any material question arising in the course of a proceeding, where he finds that it is necessary to do so to prevent substantial prejudice to any party or to expedite the conduct of the proceeding. The presiding officer or the commission may thereafter stay the proceeding if necessary to protect the substantial rights of any of the parties therein. The commission shall determine the question forthwith and the hearing and further decision shall thereafter be governed accordingly. No interlocutory appeal to the commission shall otherwise be allowed, except as may be allowed by the commission. (f) Declaratory orders.-- The commission, with like effect as in the case of other orders, and in its sound discretion, may issue a declaratory order to terminate a controversy or remove uncertainty. (g) Official notice defined.-- As used in this chapter the term \"official notice\" means a method by which the commission may notify all parties that no further evidence will be heard on a material fact and that unless the parties prove to the contrary, the commission's findings will include that particular fact.

(a) Burden of proof.-- Except as may be otherwise provided in section 315 (relating to burden of proof) or other provisions of this part or other relevant statute, the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof. (b) Admissibility of evidence.-- Any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the commission shall as a matter of policy provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. No sanction shall be imposed or rule or order be issued except upon consideration of the whole record or such portions thereof as may be cited by any party and as supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative and substantial evidence. (c) Submission of evidence.-- Every party is entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The commission may, by rule, adopt procedures for the submission of all or part of the evidence in written form. (d) Record, briefs and argument.-- The transcript of a public input hearing, the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, constitutes the exclusive record for decision, and shall be available for inspection by the public. Briefing and oral argument shall be held in accordance with rules established by the commission. For the purpose of this section, a public input hearing is a hearing held in the service area at which the ratepayers may offer testimony, written or otherwise, relating to any matter which has a bearing on the proceeding. (e) Official notice of facts.-- When the commission's decision rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, upon notification that facts are about to be or have been noticed, any party adversely affected shall have the opportunity upon timely request to show that the facts are not properly noticed or that alternative facts should be noticed. The commission in its discretion shall determine whether written presentations suffice, or whether oral argument, oral evidence, or cross-examination is appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the application by the commission in appropriate circumstances of the doctrine of judicial notice. (f) Actions of parties and counsel.-- Any party who shall fail to be represented at a scheduled conference or hearing after being duly notified thereof, shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to participate in such conference or hearing, and shall not be permitted thereafter to reopen the disposition of any matter accomplished thereat, or to recall for further examination of witnesses who were excused, unless the presiding officer shall determine that failure to be represented was unavoidable and that the interests of the other parties and the public would not be prejudiced by permitting such reopening or further examination. If the actions of a party or counsel in a proceeding shall be determined by the commission, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, to be obstructive to the orderly conduct of the proceeding and inimical to the public interest, the commission may reject or dismiss any rule or order in any manner proposed by the offending party or counsel, and, with respect to counsel, may bar further participation by him in any proceedings before the commission. (g) Decision of administrative law judge.-- In all on-the-record proceedings referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) (relating to powers of commission and administrative law judges), hearings shall be commenced by the administrative law judge within 90 days after the proceeding is initiated, and he shall render a decision within 90 days after the record is closed, unless the commission for good cause by order allows an extension not to exceed an additional 90 days. (h) Exceptions and appeal procedure.-- Any party to a proceeding referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) may file exceptions to the decision of the administrative law judge with the commission, in a form and manner and within the time to be prescribed by the commission. The commission shall rule upon such exceptions within 90 days after filing. If no exceptions are filed, the decision shall become final, without further commission action, unless two or more commissioners within 15 days after the decision request that the commission review the decision and make such other order, within 90 days of such request, as it shall determine. The Office of Trial Staff and the chief counsel shall be deemed to have automatic standing as a party to such proceeding and may file exceptions to any decision of the administrative law judge under this subsection. (i) Review of testimony.-- Any party of record in an investigation or inquiry by or hearing before the commission or its representative whose testimony is recorded electronically and subsequently transcribed shall, upon request, be permitted to review the recording to ensure that it has been transcribed accurately. The commission may impose a fee in an amount not exceeding the actual costs involved for making the recording available. Any request to review the recording must be made within the time prescribed by commission regulation, and such request shall not be used to unreasonably delay commission proceedings. This section shall not be construed to require the electronic recording of testimony. The official record of a proceeding shall be the written transcript.

      "text": "§ 333. Prehearing procedures. (a) Conferences.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority to hold one or more prehearing conferences during the course of the proceeding on his own motion or at the request of a party to the proceeding. The presiding officer shall normally hold at least one prehearing conference in proceedings where the issues are complex or where it appears likely that the hearing will last a considerable period of time. In addition to other matters which the commission may prescribe by rule, the presiding officer at a prehearing conference may direct the parties to exchange their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists prior to the hearing. Where good cause exists, the parties may at any time amend, by deletion or supplementation, their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists. (b) Depositions.-- A party to the proceeding shall be able to take depositions of witnesses upon oral examination or written questions for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information, subject to the following conditions: (1) The taking of depositions shall normally be deferred until there has been at least one prehearing conference. (2) The party seeking to take a deposition shall apply to the presiding officer for an order to do so. (3) The party seeking to take a deposition shall serve copies of the application on the other party or parties to the proceedings, who shall be given an opportunity, along with the deponent, to notify the presiding officer of any objections to the taking of the deposition. (4) The presiding officer shall not grant an application to take a deposition if he finds that the taking of the deposition would result in undue delay. (5) The presiding officer shall otherwise grant an application to take a deposition unless he finds that there is not good cause for doing so. (6) The deposing of a commission employee shall only be allowed upon an order of the presiding officer based on a specific finding that the party applying to take the deposition is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. Any such order shall be subject to an interlocutory appeal to the commission. (7) An order to take a deposition shall be enforceable through the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum. (c) Disclosure of information on witnesses.-- At the prehearing conference or at some other reasonable time prior to the hearing, which may be established by commission rule, each party to the proceeding shall make available to the other parties to the proceeding the names of the witnesses he expects to call and the subject matter of their expected testimony. Where good cause exists, the parties shall have the right at any time to amend, by deletion or supplementation, the list of names of the witnesses they plan to call and the subject matter of the expected testimony of those witnesses. (d) Interrogatories.-- Any party to a proceeding may serve written interrogatories upon any other party for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information. A party served with interrogatories may, before the time prescribed either by commission rule or otherwise for answering the interrogatories, apply to the presiding officer for the holding of a prehearing conference for the mutual exchange of evidence exhibits and other information. Each interrogatory which requests information not previously supplied at a prehearing conference or hearing shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for the objections shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections within a reasonable time, unless otherwise specified, upon the party submitting the interrogatories. The party submitting the interrogatories may petition the presiding officer for an order compelling an answer to an interrogatory or interrogatories to which there has been an objection or other failure to answer. The commission shall designate an appropriate official, other than the Director of Trial Staff or any other employee of the Office of Trial Staff, on whom other parties to the proceeding may serve written interrogatories directed to the commission. That official shall arrange for agency personnel with knowledge of the facts to answer and sign the interrogatories on behalf of the commission. Interrogatories directed to the commission shall be allowed only upon an order of the commission based upon a specific finding that the interrogating party is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. When participating in a commission proceeding, the Office of Trial Staff shall be subject to the same rules of discovery applicable to any other party to the case. (e) Requests for admissions.-- A party to a proceeding may serve upon any other party and upon the commission to the same extent permissible in subsection (d) a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding and to conserve hearing time, of any relevant, unprivileged, undisputed facts, the genuineness of any document described in the request, the admissibility of evidence, the order of proof and other similar matters. (f) Subpoena duces tecum.-- A party to a proceeding may obtain in accordance with commission rules a subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of or the making available for inspection, copying or photographing of relevant necessary designated documents at a prehearing conference or other specific time and place. (g) Scheduling.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority to impose schedules on the parties to the proceeding specifying the periods of time during which the parties may pursue each means of discovery available to them under the rules of the commission. Such schedules and time periods shall be set with a view to accelerating disposition of the case to the fullest extent consistent with fairness. (h) Certification of interlocutory appeals.-- Except as provided in subsection (b)(6), an interlocutory appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer on discovery shall be allowed only upon certification by the presiding officer that the ruling involves an important question of law or policy which should be resolved at that time. Notwithstanding the presiding officer's certification, the commission shall have the authority to dismiss summarily the interlocutory appeal if it should appear that the certification was improvident. An interlocutory appeal shall not result in a stay of the proceedings except upon a finding by the presiding officer and the commission that extraordinary circumstances exist. (i) Protective orders.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority, upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, to make any order, subject to the rules of the commission, which justice requires to protect the party or person. (j) Other subpoenas.-- The presiding officer shall have the power in accordance with commission rules to issue subpoenas ad testificandum and duces tecum at any time during the course of the proceeding.

(b) Outside consultation prohibited.-- Save to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters not prohibited by this part, no presiding officer shall consult any person or party on any fact in issue unless upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate; nor shall any presiding officer be responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of any officer, employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for the commission.

(a) Procedures.-- When the commission does not preside at the reception of evidence, the presiding officer shall initially decide the case, unless the commission requires, either in specific cases or by general rule, the entire record to be certified to it for decision. When the presiding officer makes an initial decision, that decision then shall be approved by the commission and may become the opinion of the commission without further proceeding within the time provided by commission rule. On review of the initial decision, the commission has all the powers which it would have in making the initial decision except as it may limit the issues on notice or by rule.

Alternatively, in all other matters: (1) the commission may issue a tentative decision or one of its responsible employees may recommend a decision; or (2) this procedure may be omitted in a case in which the commission finds on the record that due and timely execution of the functions imperatively and unavoidably so requires. (b) Exceptions or proposed findings and conclusions.-- Before a recommended, initial or tentative decision issued under this section, or a decision on commission review of the decision of subordinate employees, the parties are entitled to a reasonable opportunity to submit for the consideration of the commission: (1) (i) proposed findings and conclusions; or (ii) exceptions to the decisions or recommended decisions of subordinate employees or to tentative commission decisions; and (2) supporting reason for the exceptions or proposed findings or conclusions. (c) Record.-- The record shall show the ruling on each finding, conclusion or exception presented. All decisions, including initial, recommended and tentative decisions, are a part of the record and shall include a statement of: (1) findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record; and (2) the appropriate rule, order, sanction, relief or denial thereof. (d) Release of documents.-- In addition to any other requirements imposed by law, including the act of June 21, 1957 (P.L.390, No.212), referred to as the Right-to-Know Law, and the act of July 3, 1986 (P.L.388, No.84), known as the Sunshine Act, whenever the commission conducts an investigation of an act or practice of a public utility and makes a decision, enters into a settlement with a public utility or takes any other official action, as defined in the Sunshine Act, with respect to its investigation, it shall make part of the public record and release publicly any documents relied upon by the commission in reaching its determination, whether prepared by consultants or commission employees, other than documents protected by legal privilege; provided, however, that if a document contains trade secrets or proprietary information and it has been determined by the commission that harm to the person claiming the privilege would be substantial or if a document required to be released under this section contains identifying information which would operate to the prejudice or impairment of a person's reputation or personal security, or information that would lead to the disclosure of a confidential source or subject a person to potential economic retaliation as a result of their cooperation with a commission investigation, or information which, if disclosed to the public, could be used for criminal or terroristic purposes, the identifying information may be expurgated from the copy of the document made part of the public record. For the purposes of this section, \"a document\" means a report, memorandum or other document prepared for or used by the commission in the course of its investigation whether prepared by an adviser, consultant or other person who is not an employee of the commission or by an employee of the commission.

      "text": "§ 510. Assessment for regulatory expenses upon public utilities. (a) Determination of assessment.-- Before November 1 of each year, the commission shall estimate its total expenditures in the administration of this part for the fiscal year beginning July of the following year, which estimate shall not exceed three-tenths of 1% of the total gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utilities and licensed entities under its jurisdiction for the preceding calendar year, except that the estimate may exceed this amount to reflect Federal funds received by the commission and funds received from other sources to perform functions that are unrelated to the regulation of public utilities and licensed entities. Such estimate shall be submitted to the Governor in accordance with section 610 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929. At the same time the commission submits its estimate to the Governor, the commission shall also submit that estimate to the General Assembly. The commission or its designated representatives shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Governor and the Senate and House Appropriations Committees regarding their estimates. The commission shall subtract from the final estimate: (1) The estimated fees to be collected pursuant to section 317 (relating to fees for services rendered by commission) during such fiscal year. (2) The estimated balance of the appropriation, specified in section 511 (relating to disposition, appropriation and disbursement of assessments and fees), to be carried over into such fiscal year from the preceding one. The remainder so determined, herein called the total assessment, shall be allocated to, and paid by, such public utilities in the manner prescribed. If the General Assembly fails to approve the commission's budget for the purposes of this part, by March 30, the commission shall assess public utilities on the basis of the last approved operating budget. At such time as the General Assembly approves the proposed budget the commission shall have the authority to make an adjustment in the assessments to reflect the approved budget. If, subsequent to the approval of the budget, the commission determines that a supplemental budget may be needed, the commission shall submit its request for that supplemental budget simultaneously to the Governor and the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. (b) Allocation of assessment.-- On or before March 31 of each year, every public utility shall file with the commission a statement under oath showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the preceding calendar year. If any public utility shall fail to file such statement on or before March 31, the commission shall estimate such revenues, which estimate shall be binding upon the public utility for the purposes of this section. For each fiscal year, the allocation shall be made as follows: (1) The commission shall determine for the preceding calendar year the amount of its expenditures directly attributable to the regulation of each group of utilities furnishing the same kind of service, and debit the amount so determined to such group. The commission may, for purposes of the assessment, deem utilities rendering water, sewer or water and sewer service, as defined in the definition of \"public utility\" in section 102 (relating to definitions), as a utility group. (2) The commission shall also determine for the preceding calendar year the balance of its expenditures, not debited as aforesaid, and allocate such balance to each group in the proportion which the gross intrastate operating revenues of such group for that year bear to the gross intrastate operating revenues of all groups for that year. (3) The commission shall then allocate the total assessment prescribed by subsection (a) to each group in the proportion which the sum of the debits made to it bears to the sum of the debits made to all groups. (4) Each public utility within a group shall then be assessed for and shall pay to the commission such proportion of the amount allocated to its group as the gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utility for the preceding calendar year bear to the total gross intrastate operating revenues of its group for that year. (5) (Repealed). (c) Notice, hearing and payment.-- The commission shall give notice by registered or certified mail to each public utility of the amount lawfully charged against it under the provisions of this section, which amount shall be paid by the public utility within 30 days of receipt of such notice, unless the commission specifies on the notices sent to all public utilities an installment plan of payment, in which case each public utility shall pay each installment on or before the date specified therefor by the commission. Within 15 days after receipt of such notice, the public utility against which such assessment has been made may file with the commission objections setting out in detail the grounds upon which the objector regards such assessment to be excessive, erroneous, unlawful or invalid. The commission, after notice to the objector, shall hold a hearing upon such objections. After such hearing, the commission shall record upon its minutes its findings on the objections and shall transmit to the objector, by registered or certified mail, notice of the amount, if any, charged against it in accordance with such findings, which amount or any installment thereof then due, shall be paid by the objector within ten days after receipt of notice of the findings of the commission with respect to such objections. If any payment prescribed by this subsection is not made as aforesaid, the commission may suspend or revoke certificates of public convenience, certify automobile registrations to the Department of Transportation for suspension or revocation or, through the Department of Justice, may institute an appropriate action at law for the amount lawfully assessed, together with any additional cost incurred by the commission or the Department of Justice by virtue of such failure to pay. (d) Suits by public utilities.-- No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the purpose of restraining or in anywise delaying the collection or payment of any assessment made under subsections (a), (b) and (c), but every public utility against which an assessment is made shall pay the same as provided in subsection (c). Any public utility making any such payment may, at any time within two years from the date of payment, sue the Commonwealth in an action at law to recover the amount paid, or any part thereof, upon the ground that the assessment was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, in whole or in part, provided objections, as hereinbefore provided, were filed with the commission, and payment of the assessment was made under protest either as to all or part thereof. In any action for recovery of any payments made under this section, the claimant shall be entitled to raise every relevant issue of law, but the findings of fact made by the commission, pursuant to this section, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. Any records, books, data, documents, and memoranda relating to the expenses of the commission shall be admissible in evidence in any court and shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of their contents. If it is finally determined in any such action that all or any part of the assessment for which payment was made under protest was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, the commission shall make a refund to the claimant out of the appropriation specified in section 511 as directed by the court. (e) Certain provisions not applicable.-- The provisions of this part relating to the judicial review of orders and determinations of the commission shall not be applicable to any findings, determinations, or assessments made under this section. The procedure in this section providing for the determination of the lawfulness of assessments and the recovery back of payments made pursuant to such assessment shall be exclusive of all other remedies and procedures. (f) Intent of section.-- It is the intent and purpose of this section that each public utility subject to this part shall advance to the commission its reasonable share of the cost of administering this part. The commission shall keep records of the costs incurred in connection with the administration and enforcement of this part or any other statute. The commission shall also keep a record of the manner in which it shall have computed the amount assessed against every public utility. Such records shall be open to inspection by all interested parties. The determination of such costs and assessments by the commission, and the records and data upon which the same are made, shall be considered prima facie correct; and in any proceeding instituted to challenge the reasonableness or correctness of any assessment under this section, the party challenging the same shall have the burden of proof. (g) Saving provision.-- This section does not affect or repeal any of the provisions of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), known as the \"Commonwealth Documents Law.\" (Dec. 18, 1980, P.L.1247, No.226, eff. imd.; July 10, 1986, P.L.1238, No.114, eff. imd.; Apr. 4, 1990, P.L.93, No.21, eff. 90 days; June 22, 1990, P.L.241, No.56, eff. 60 days; Dec. 30, 2002, P.L.2001, No.230, eff. 60 days; July 16, 2004, P.L.758, No.94; Oct. 22, 2014, P.L.2545, No.155, eff. 60 days) 2014 Amendment.

(b) Incentive for uprating.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations which establish a special cost recovery and shared benefits procedure for electric utilities and their ratepayers as an incentive to implement upratings as provided in subsection (a). Nothing in this section shall permit or require the commission to establish rates or procedures which are inconsistent with any other section in this title. (c) Cost of upgrading.-- Notwithstanding section 1315 (relating to limitation on consideration of certain costs for electric utilities) and subject to regulations promulgated by the commission, the commission may allow a portion of the prudently incurred costs, determined on a per megawatt basis and not to exceed 50% of the unit's undepreciated original cost per megawatt, of uprating the capability of an existing coal-fueled plant to use coal mined in Pennsylvania to be made a part of the rate base or otherwise included in the rates charged by the utility before such uprating is completed.

The commission shall establish procedures for audits of the operations of utilities as provided in this section.

(b) Management efficiency investigations.-- In addition to the audits mandated by subsection (a), the commission shall appoint a management efficiency investigator who shall periodically examine the management effectiveness and operating efficiency of all utilities required to be audited under subsection (a) and monitor the utility company responses to the audits required by subsection (a). For the purposes of carrying out the periodic audit required by this subsection and for carrying out the monitoring of audits required by subsection (a), the commission is hereby empowered to direct the management efficiency investigator to conduct such investigations through and with teams made up of commission staff and/or independent consulting firms; further, the commission may designate specific items of management effectiveness and operating efficiency to be investigated. The management efficiency investigator shall provide an annual report to the commission, the affected utility, the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate detailing the findings of such investigations. (c) Use of independent auditing firms.-- The commission may require an audit under subsection (a) or (b) to be performed by an independent consulting firm. When the commission, under either subsection (a) or (b), orders an audit to be performed by an independent consulting firm, the commission, after consultation with the utility, shall select the firm and require the utility to enter into a contract with the firm providing for payment of the firm by the utility. The terms of the contract shall include all reasonable expenses directly related to the performance of the audit or to the management efficiency investigation activities of independent consulting firms at the utility, as well as their preparation and presentation of testimony in any contested litigation which may be undertaken as a result of the audit findings under subsection (a) or (b).

(a) General rule.-- The commission shall order any public utility engaged in producing, generating, transmitting, distributing or furnishing electricity to cancel or modify the construction of, or its participation in the construction of, any generating unit where the commission, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, determines that the construction is not in the public interest. In addition to any other relevant matters, the commission shall consider in its determination whether: (1) The generating unit is necessary for the utility to provide adequate and reliable service to the public. (2) There are less costly alternatives by which the utility could maintain its ability to provide adequate and reliable service. (b) Investigations and hearings.-- For the purpose of enabling the commission to make its determination, it may hold hearings, make inquiries and require the submission of information which it deems necessary or proper in enabling it to reach a determination. The burden of proof at these hearings to show that construction of the generating unit is in the public interest shall be on the public utility. (c) Regulatory treatment of costs.-- Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, for a generating unit canceled after the effective date of this section, either voluntarily or by commission order, an electric utility may be permitted to recover a return of, but not a return on, prudently incurred costs on any partially completed facility when cancellation is found by the commission to be in the public interest. The burden of proof to show that any costs claimed were prudently incurred shall be on the public utility. (Oct. 10, 1985, P.L.257, No.62, eff. imd.) 1985 Amendment. Act 62 added section 520.",

(b) Return to normal operation.-- The commission may, upon its own motion or upon complaint, order a public utility to return an electric generating unit to normal operation if the commission determines that it would be more cost effective for the utility's ratepayers if the unit were to be returned to normal operation, with or without capital additions or operating improvements, than if the utility were to implement its plan for providing the power which the unit is, or could be made, capable of producing. (c) Procedure.-- The commission may hold such hearings as it deems necessary in making the determinations required by subsection (a) or (b). The affected public utility shall have the burden of proof in any proceeding pursuant to this section. (d) Regulations.-- The commission may adopt such regulations as it deems necessary to carry out its powers and duties under this section. (e) Exclusion.-- This section shall not apply to a nuclear generating unit or to variations in operation of electric generating units to satisfy economic dispatch requirements or to maintain intrasystem or intersystem stability. (f) Construction costs.-- Notwithstanding section 1315 (relating to limitation on consideration of certain costs for electric utilities) and subject to regulations promulgated by the commission, the commission may allow a portion of the prudently incurred costs of capital additions, determined on a per megawatt basis and not to exceed 50% of the unit's undepreciated original cost per megawatt, to an electric generating unit to be made a part of the rate base or otherwise included in the rates charged by the utility before such capital additions are completed if the commission, acting pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), prohibits the utility from retiring the unit or orders the utility to return the unit to normal operation, provided that: (1) the capital additions would allow the continued or increased use of coal mined in Pennsylvania; and (2) the capital additions would be more cost effective for the utility's ratepayers than other alternatives for meeting the utility's load and capacity requirements. Notwithstanding section 1309 (relating to rates fixed on complaint; investigation of costs of production), the commission, by regulation, shall provide for a utility to remove the costs of capital additions from its rate base and to refund any revenues collected as the result of this subsection, plus interest, which shall be the average rate of interest specified for residential mortgage lending by the Secretary of Banking in accordance with the act of January 30, 1974 (P.L.13, No.6), referred to as the Loan Interest and Protection Law, during the period or periods for which the commission orders refunds, if the commission, after notice and hearing, determines that the capital addition has not been completed within a reasonable time. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section the term \"normal operation\" means the continuing availability of an electric generating unit to meet consumer demand except during: (1) Scheduled outages for repairs, tests or other procedures essential to the unit's further use. (2) Unscheduled outages caused by the unit's physical malfunctioning or breakdown. (3) Reduced levels of generation pending execution of repairs. (4) Reduced levels or complete cessation of generation, on a temporary basis, because of disruptions in fuel supplies, waste disposal or cooling water; or because of compliance with environmental protection limitations or conservation of fuel during periods of, or in anticipation of, scarcity.

(b) Recovery of cancellation costs of nonutility generating unit projects.-- A nonutility generating unit project is a generating unit project that is not owned by a public utility. If the construction of a nonutility generating unit project for which a public utility has a contract, whether entered into voluntarily or pursuant to commission order, to purchase project energy or project capacity and energy is canceled by mutual agreement of the project developer and the public utility prior to the unit's completion and operation, the public utility may recover all costs to be paid to the project developer and all costs directly related thereto which are prudently incurred as a result of such cancellation.

      "text": "§ 528. Use of foreign coal by qualifying facilities. (a) Legislative findings.-- The General Assembly hereby finds as follows: (1) Potential qualifying facilities which would generate electricity from United States energy sources are, and will for the foreseeable future continue to be, able to supplement adequately the capacity needs of public utilities in this Commonwealth. (2) Some of those qualifying facilities offer the multiple benefits of supplying electricity to Pennsylvania ratepayers at a reasonable price, creating jobs in areas of high unemployment in this Commonwealth and helping to clean up this Commonwealth's environment. (3) Although Federal law places a duty on public utilities to buy electricity generated by qualifying facilities, Federal law does not dictate how the price paid by public utilities and the charges to ratepayers for that electricity are to be calculated. (4) The energy source used by a qualifying facility is a significant factor in determining if a qualifying facility would be able to meet its commitment to supply electricity to a public utility at a reasonable price. (5) Coal mined in a foreign country is subject to major supply interruptions, price increases and quality reductions which are unpredictable and which may result not only from market factors, but also from foreign policy decisions of the United States Government or one or more foreign governments or from domestic policy changes in the foreign country in which the coal is mined. (6) It is much easier for a public utility and the commission to predict the reliability of a qualifying facility and the reasonableness of the price of the electricity to be supplied by that qualifying facility if United States energy sources are to be used than if coal mined in a foreign country is to be used. (7) A qualifying facility which would burn coal mined in a foreign country is too potentially unreliable to justify a public utility in foregoing alternative capacity commitments and in paying the qualifying facility a price which includes any capacity credit. (b) General rule.-- The price paid by a public utility to a qualifying facility and the charge imposed on the utility's ratepayers for electricity generated by that qualifying facility shall not include any capacity credit if that qualifying facility burns coal mined in a foreign country. (c) Restriction on contract approval.-- The commission shall not approve any contract between a public utility and a qualifying facility which burns coal mined in a foreign country for the purchase by the utility of electricity generated by the qualifying facility unless: (1) the price to be paid by the utility reflects no more than the actual avoided cost of the utility when the payment is made; and (2) the contract does not exceed five years in duration. (d) Review of contracts.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a contract in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter between a public utility and a qualifying facility for the purchase by the utility of electricity generated by the qualifying facility shall, after notice and hearing, be subject to review and modification in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) at any time upon complaint or upon the commission's own motion if the qualifying facility burns coal mined in a foreign country. (e) Recovery from ratepayers.-- For the express purpose of implementing the intent of this section, a public utility shall not be permitted to recover from ratepayers pursuant to section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) any of the costs associated with a contract between the utility and a qualifying facility which burns coal mined in a foreign country for the purchase by the utility of electricity generated by the qualifying facility. Any such costs which the commission determines to be reasonable and prudent shall be recoverable only through a base rate proceeding pursuant to Chapter 13 (relating to rates and rate making). (f) Definition.-- For the purposes of this section, \"qualifying facility\" means any cogeneration facility or small power producer which is a qualifying facility pursuant to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's guidelines set forth at 18 CFR §§ 292.101(b)(1) (relating to definitions) and 292.203(a) and (b) (relating to general requirements for qualification). (g) Severability.-- The provisions of this section shall be severable. If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any public utility, qualifying facility or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this section and the application of any provision thereof to any other public utilities, qualifying facilities or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

(b) Phase II compliance.-- On or before January 1, 1996, each public utility shall submit to the commission and may request commission approval of a plan to bring its generating units which use coal to generate electricity into compliance with the Phase II requirements of Title IV of the Clean Air Act. (c) Notice of plan.-- At the same time it submits its plan to the commission, the public utility shall provide a copy of the plan to the Department of Environmental Resources, the Consumer Advocate and the Small Business Advocate. For plans submitted after the effective date of this section, the commission shall cause notice of the utility's filing to be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.

(d) Review by commission.-- (1) If the utility has requested commission approval of its plan, the commission shall review the proposed plan on an expedited basis to determine if the utility's proposed compliance plan submitted under this section is in the public interest. (2) After notice and opportunity for a hearing, the commission shall approve or disapprove the compliance plan within nine months after the plan is filed, provided that approval may be in whole or in part and may be subject to such limitations and qualifications as may be deemed necessary and in the public interest. The commission's decision shall establish that the utility's costs of compliance are recoverable costs of service, provided the costs: (i) are reasonable in amount and prudently incurred as determined in an appropriate rate or other proceeding; and (ii) represent investment in flue gas desulfurization devices, clean coal technologies or similar facilities designed to maintain or promote the use of coal, including facilities which intermittently or simultaneously burn natural gas with coal. (3) Costs established as recoverable under paragraph (2) shall qualify as nonrevenue-producing investment to improve environmental conditions under section 1315 (relating to limitation on consideration of certain costs for electric utilities), provided that any benefits to the utility generated by the sale of allowances under the Clean Air Act shall be flowed through to the utility's ratepayers. (4) The utility shall not be required to refile its plan or to seek additional commission approvals concerning its plan unless the utility's plan is significantly amended or revised.

(a) Staggered renewal system to be established.-- The department shall establish a system of staggered registration renewal in a manner that an approximately equal number of registrations will expire every month throughout the year. In order to implement and maintain the staggered registration system, the department may prorate annual registration fees over registration periods of from 6 to 18 months. (a.1) Seasonal registration.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a passenger car, recreational motor vehicle, motorcycle, truck or farm vehicle which does not have a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 14,000 pounds may register the vehicle with the department for a period of successive months of less than one year. The applicant shall specify the period of months during which the vehicle shall be registered. Except when the department initially converts a currently valid annual registration to a seasonal registration, the annual fee prescribed for the vehicle by Chapter 19 (relating to fees) shall be paid in full by the applicant regardless of the number of months chosen for registration by the applicant. Upon receipt of the appropriate fee and the properly completed form, including all information required by this chapter, the department shall issue a seasonal registration that shall expire on the last day of the expiration month chosen by the registrant. No insurer of a vehicle belonging to any owner or lessee who obtains a seasonal registration and who applies for or receives a reduced automobile insurance premium on account thereof shall be required to provide any contractual coverage, whether in the form of the provision of a defense or the payment of first-party or third-party benefits or otherwise, to the owner or lessee in connection with any event occurring during that part of the year in which the vehicle is not registered; and such owner or lessee shall be treated for all purposes, including, without limitation, ascertaining rights to stack coverages and to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, as a person who does not own that vehicle and has no duty to carry financial responsibility on it for that part of the year. (b) New registration.-- A new registration is effective on the date of issuance of a registration card by the department or the date of issuance of a temporary registration card by an authorized agent of the department under section 1310 (relating to temporary registration cards). (c) Renewal of registration.-- A renewed registration shall be effective on issuance by the department of a renewed registration card. (d) Expiration of registration.-- A registration shall expire on the last day of the month designated on the registration card. (e) Antique, classic and collectible vehicles.-- Antique, classic and collectible motor vehicle registrations shall expire upon the salvaging, scrapping or transfer of ownership of the vehicle, except that if the transfer is between spouses or between parent and child the registration may be transferred upon payment of a transfer fee. (f) Optional permanent trailer registration.-- Except as set forth in section 1920(c) (relating to trailers), the registration of trailers permanently registered as provided in section 1920(c) shall expire upon salvaging of the vehicle or transfer of ownership. (g) Election.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a motor vehicle, except a motor vehicle registered under the International Registration Plan and a motor vehicle with a seasonal registration or a circus or carnival plate, may elect to pay an annual registration fee for a two-year period. The fee shall be two times the amount of the registration fee otherwise payable for the motor vehicle under this title.

(2) An alternative rate mechanism established under this section may include rates under section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) or 1308 (relating to voluntary changes in rates) and may provide for recovery of returns on and return of capital investments or, in the case of city natural gas distribution operations, recovery under the cash flow ratemaking method.

(a) Application for continued service.-- At any time before or after service is terminated by a public utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer, the affected tenants may apply to the utility to have service continued or resumed. (b) Payment of charges by tenants.-- A public utility shall not terminate service or shall promptly resume service previously terminated if it receives from the tenants an amount equal to the bill for the affected account of the landlord ratepayer for the billing month preceding the notice to the tenants. Thereafter, the utility shall notify each tenant of the total amount of the bill for the second and each succeeding billing month and, if the tenants fail to make payment of any bill within 30 days of the delivery of the notice to the tenants, the utility may commence termination of service, except that no termination may occur until 30 days after each tenant has been furnished notice of the proposed termination as prescribed in section 1528 (relating to delivery and contents of subsequent termination notice to tenants). The tenant or tenants shall make payment to the utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer by check or money order drawn by the tenant to the order of the utility or by cash. In all cases, the tenant shall provide, upon request, reasonable identification to the utility. For the purposes of this section, \"reasonable identification\" shall include, but not be limited to, a driver's license, photo identification, medical assistance or food stamp identification or any similar document issued by any public agency which contains the name and address of the tenant. (c) Disposition of payment by utility.-- Upon receiving any payment, the utility shall notify the landlord ratepayer who is liable for the utility service of the amount or amounts paid by any tenant and the amount or amounts credited to the landlord's bill for each tenant pursuant to this section. Tenants requesting continued utility service under this section, except those individually subscribing for service under subsection (d), shall not be considered utility customers but shall be considered to be acting on behalf of the landlord ratepayer, who shall remain liable to the utility for service provided after notice to tenants. In the event that the tenants fail to satisfy the requirements of subsection (b) with regard to the first billing month period preceding notice to the tenant, the utility shall refund any moneys received from a tenant to that tenant. Any payments made by the tenants shall be applied first against the bill for the billing month preceding notice to the tenants and then against bills for service rendered subsequent to the bill. Upon termination of service to the tenants for failure to pay the utility bill for service in full for any subsequent month or upon voluntary discontinuance of service at the request of the tenants, the utility shall immediately refund to the tenants any amounts paid to the utility for the billing period for which payment in full was not remitted. (d) Agreement for individual service.-- Any tenant of a residential building or mobile home park who has been notified of a proposed discontinuance of utility service pursuant to section 1523 (relating to notices before service to landlord discontinued) shall have the right to agree to subscribe for future service individually if this can be accomplished without a major revision of distribution facilities or additional right-of-way acquisitions.

      "text": "§ 1533. Petition to appoint receiver. (a) Appointment of receiver.-- Notwithstanding the foregoing sections of this chapter, when a landlord ratepayer is two or more months in arrears in his utility payments, the affected utility shall have the right to petition the court of common pleas of the county wherein the leased premises are located to appoint a receiver to collect rent payments otherwise due the landlord ratepayer directly from the tenants and to pay all overdue and subsequent utility bills therefrom. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to supersede any tenant rights or defenses under law regarding the payment of rent. This right may be exercised only in those situations that involve units which are not individually metered by the utility. Upon appointment, the receiver shall notify the tenants of his powers and their rights under law regarding payment of rent and continued utility service by first class mail, certified mail, personal service or posting notice in each unit in the leased premises. (b) Right to continued service.-- The affected utility under this section shall not terminate utility service if it receives payment from the receiver in the amount specified in subsection (c)(2) within 60 days from the date notice to the tenants of the appointment of the receiver is mailed or delivered. (c) Duty of receiver.-- The receiver shall: (1) collect all rents directly from the tenants; (2) pay the utility bills equal to the amount due for the billing month prior to the tenants receiving notice of the appointment of the receiver and all future bills as they become due; (3) after payment of the amounts in subsection (c)(2), any excess moneys shall be applied pursuant to further order of court; and (4) return the remainder to the landlord ratepayer, less the costs of the notification made to the tenants, plus a 2% administrative fee. (d) Termination.-- The receiver shall continue to collect the rents and make disbursements in the manner provided in subsection (c) until the second rental period ends after all of the following conditions have been met: (1) The landlord ratepayer deposits in escrow with the utility a sum equal to the utility charges from the two highest monthly periods in the preceding 12 months. (2) The landlord ratepayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court of common pleas that it has the financial recourses necessary to resume its obligations to the utility and the tenants. (3) The landlord ratepayer pays the undisputed amount of all outstanding utility bills. At such time rental payments will once again be made to the landlord ratepayer. Notice of this change shall be made to the tenants by the receiver by means of first class mail, certified mail, personal service or posting notice in each unit in the leased premises, the costs of notice to be paid by the landlord ratepayer. (e) Escrow fund.-- The escrow fund established under subsection (d)(1) shall not be considered a prepayment of utility costs and shall be applied only against outstanding utility bills at the time a new receiver is appointed for a subsequent failure by the landlord ratepayer to pay utility bills for a two-month period. The escrow fund shall be returned to the landlord ratepayer not later than 90 days nor earlier than 60 days, after the landlord ratepayer obtains a court order releasing the fund and certifying that timely payment of utility bills has been made for the immediately preceding 24 consecutive months.

(a) Financial responsibility requirements.-- (1) Each insurer, not less than 45 days prior to the first renewal of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall notify in writing each named insured of the availability of two alternatives of full tort insurance and limited tort insurance described in subsections (c) and (d). The notice shall be a standardized form adopted by the commissioner and shall include the following language: NOTICE TO NAMED INSUREDS A. \"Limited Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania give you the right to choose a form of insurance that limits your right and the right of members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses, but not for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages unless the injuries suffered fall within the definition of \"serious injury\" as set forth in the policy or unless one of several other exceptions noted in the policy applies. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"limited tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. B. \"Full Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also give you the right to choose a form of insurance under which you maintain an unrestricted right for you and the members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses and may also seek financial compensation for pain and suffering and other nonmonetary damages as a result of injuries caused by other drivers. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"full tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. C. You may contact your insurance agent, broker or company to discuss the cost of other coverages. D. If you wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A, you must sign this notice where indicated below and return it. If you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date E. If you wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B, you may sign this notice where indicated below and return it. However, if you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date (2) Insurers shall print the above notice containing both options on one sheet in prominent type and place in a prominent location. Any person signing, or otherwise bound by, a document containing such terms is bound by such election and is precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed in making the election between full tort or limited tort alternatives. Where there are two or more named insureds on a policy, any named insured may make the full or limited tort election provided for in this section for all named insureds on the policy. (3) If a named insured who receives a notice under paragraph (1) does not indicate a choice within 20 days, the insurer shall send a second notice. The second notice shall be in a form identical to the first notice, except that it shall be identified as a second and final notice. If a named insured has not responded to either notice ten days prior to the renewal date, the named insured and those he is empowered by this section to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. All notices required by this section shall advise that if no tort election is made, the named insured and those he is empowered to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. Any person subject to the limited tort option by virtue of this section shall be precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed. (4) Each insurer, prior to the first issuance of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall provide each applicant with the notice required by paragraph (1). A policy may not be issued until the applicant has been provided an opportunity to elect a tort option. (5) An owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle who does not have financial responsibility shall be deemed to have chosen the limited tort alternative. (6) Nothing in this section changes or modifies the existing requirement that owners of registered vehicles maintain bodily injury and property damage liability insurance arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. (b) Application of tort options.-- (1) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all private passenger motor vehicle policies of the named insured issued by the same insurer and shall continue in force as to all subsequent renewal policies, replacement policies and any other private passenger motor vehicle policies under which the individual is a named insured until the insurer, or its authorized representative, receives a properly executed form electing the other tort option. (2) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all insureds under the private passenger motor vehicle policy who are not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy. In the case where more than one private passenger motor vehicle policy is applicable to an insured and the policies have conflicting tort options, the insured is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the private passenger motor vehicle in which the insured is an occupant at the time of the accident if he is an insured on that policy and bound by the full tort option otherwise. (3) An individual who is not an owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle and who is not a named insured or insured under any private passenger motor vehicle policy shall not be precluded from maintaining an action for noneconomic loss or economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (c) Full tort alternative.-- Each person who is bound by the full tort election remains eligible to seek compensation for noneconomic loss claimed and economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (d) Limited tort alternative.-- Each person who elects the limited tort alternative remains eligible to seek compensation for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. Unless the injury sustained is a serious injury, each person who is bound by the limited tort election shall be precluded from maintaining an action for any noneconomic loss, except that: (1) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election who sustains damages in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person may recover damages as if the individual damaged had elected the full tort alternative whenever the person at fault: (i) is convicted or accepts Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in that accident; (ii) is operating a motor vehicle registered in another state; (iii) intends to injure himself or another person, provided that an individual does not intentionally injure himself or another person merely because his act or failure to act is intentional or done with his realization that it creates a grave risk of causing injury or the act or omission causing the injury is for the purpose of averting bodily harm to himself or another person; or (iv) has not maintained financial responsibility as required by this chapter, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall affect the limitation of section 1731(d)(2) (relating to availability, scope and amount of coverage). (2) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights with respect to claims against a person in the business of designing, manufacturing, repairing, servicing or otherwise maintaining motor vehicles arising out of a defect in such motor vehicle which is caused by or not corrected by an act or omission in the course of such business, other than a defect in a motor vehicle which is operated by such business. (3) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights if injured while an occupant of a motor vehicle other than a private passenger motor vehicle. (e) Nondiscrimination.-- No insurer shall cancel, refuse to write or refuse to renew a motor vehicle insurance policy based on the tort option election of the named insured. Any violation of this subsection shall be deemed a violation of the Automobile Insurance Policy Act. (f) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases when used in this section shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Insured.\" Any individual residing in the household of the named insured who is: (1) a spouse or other relative of the named insured; or (2) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured. \"Named insured.\" Any individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.

(a) Integrity of distribution system.-- (1) Each natural gas distribution company shall maintain the integrity of its distribution system at least in conformity with the standards established by the Federal Department of Transportation and such other standards practiced by the industry in a manner sufficient to provide safe and reliable service to all retail gas customers connected to its system consistent with this title and the commission's orders or regulations. (2) In performing such duties, the natural gas distribution company shall implement procedures to require all natural gas suppliers to supply natural gas to the natural gas distribution company at locations, volumes, qualities and pressures that are adequate to meet the natural gas supplier's supply and reliability obligations to its retail gas customers and the natural gas distribution company's supply and reliability obligations to its retail gas customers. The procedures shall include, but not be limited to: (i) A communication protocol with natural gas suppliers. (ii) An ability to issue system maintenance orders to control the flow of gas into the distribution system. (iii) The right to issue and enforce penalties pursuant to commission direction, provided, however, that the commission may approve additional procedures of like nature by order or regulation to preserve reliability. (b) Installation and improvement of facilities.-- (1) The natural gas distribution company shall not have an obligation to install nonstandard facilities, either as to type or location, for the purpose of receiving natural gas from the natural gas supplier unless the natural gas supplier or its retail gas customer pays the full cost of these facilities. (2) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the natural gas distribution company from maintaining and upgrading its system to meet retail gas customer requirements consistent with the requirement of section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities) or compliance with other statutory and regulatory requirements. (3) Disputes concerning facilities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission and may be initiated by the filing of a complaint under section 701 (relating to complaints) by the commission or any interested party. (c) Customer billing.-- (1) Subject to the right of a retail gas customer to choose to receive separate bills from its natural gas supplier for natural gas supply service, the natural gas distribution company shall be responsible for billing each of its retail gas customers for natural gas distribution service, consistent with the orders or regulations of the commission, regardless of the identity of the provider of natural gas supply services. (2) (i) Bills to retail gas customers shall contain sufficient unbundled charge information to enable the customer to determine the basis for those charges and shall comply with section 1509 (relating to billing procedures). At a minimum, such charges shall include those services which are unbundled as a result of a restructuring filing or rulemaking. (ii) Bills to retail residential customers rendered by a natural gas distribution company for natural gas distribution services shall include information required by commission regulations governing standards and billing practices for residential utility service. (iii) Bills rendered by a natural gas distribution company on behalf of a natural gas supplier shall include, in a form and manner determined by the natural gas distribution company in consultation with the natural gas supplier, the following information with respect to natural gas supplier services: the name of the natural gas supplier; the rates, charges or prices of natural gas supply services billed, including adjustments to prior period billings, if applicable, and taxes, if applicable; and the natural gas supplier's toll-free telephone number and hours of operation for customer inquiries. (3) Incremental costs relating to billing services designed, implemented and rendered by the natural gas distribution company, at its election, on behalf of a natural gas supplier or other entity may be recovered through fees charged by the natural gas distribution company to the natural gas supplier or other entity. Either party may request that the commission consider the appropriate level of the fee. In doing so, the commission shall consider fees charged by other natural gas distribution companies for similar services. The commission shall either permit the fee to continue as set or shall establish an alternative mechanism to permit full recovery of unrecovered just and reasonable costs from the supplier or the supplier's customers. Nothing in this section shall permit the recovery of such costs from natural gas supply service customers of the natural gas distribution company. (4) If services are provided by an entity other than the natural gas distribution company, the entity that provided those services shall furnish to the natural gas distribution company billing data sufficient to enable the natural gas distribution company to timely bill retail gas customers. The entity shall provide data for billing purposes in a format and in a time frame as required by the natural gas distribution company. The natural gas distribution company shall consider the data and information confidential and shall treat it as such. (5) No natural gas distribution company shall be required to forward payment to entities providing services to customers and on whose behalf the natural gas distribution company is billing those customers before the natural gas distribution company has received payment for those services from customers. The commission shall issue guidelines addressing the application of partial payments. (6) Natural gas distribution companies and natural gas suppliers shall take reasonable steps to allow retail gas customers to contribute via their bill to hardship energy funds which benefit low-income residential retail gas consumers. (7) Natural gas distribution companies shall have the right to recover on a full and current basis all prudent and reasonable costs incurred to implement customer choice from retail natural gas customers or other entities as determined by the commission. Recovery from retail natural gas customers shall be made pursuant to a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments). (d) Enhanced metering.-- Subject to commission approval, the natural gas distribution company may require the installation, at the retail gas customer's expense, of enhanced metering capability sufficient to match the natural gas delivered by the retail gas customer's natural gas supplier or suppliers with consumption by that retail gas customer. In exercising its discretion, the commission shall consider the effect on low-income retail gas customers. (June 23, 2016, P.L.355, No.47, eff. 60 days) 2016 Amendment. Act 47 added subsec. (c)(7).",

Customer service and consumer protections and policies for retail gas customers shall, at a minimum, be maintained at the same level of quality under retail competition as in existence on the effective date of this chapter. (b) Change of suppliers.-- The commission shall, by order or regulation, establish procedures to ensure that a natural gas distribution company does not change a retail gas customer's natural gas supplier without direct oral confirmation from the customer of record or written evidence of the customer's consent to a change of supplier. (c) Customer information.-- The commission shall, by order or regulation, establish requirements that each natural gas distribution company and natural gas supplier provide adequate, accurate customer information to enable retail gas customers to make informed choices regarding the purchase of all natural gas services offered by that provider. Information shall be provided to retail gas customers in an understandable format that enables retail gas customers to compare prices and services on a uniform basis. (d) Consumer education.-- Prior to the implementation of any restructuring plan under section 2204 (relating to implementation), each natural gas distribution company, in conjunction with the commission and consistent with the guidelines established by the commission, shall implement a consumer education program to inform customers of the changes in the natural gas utility industry. The program shall provide retail gas customers with information necessary to help them make appropriate choices as to their natural gas service. The education program shall be subject to approval by the commission. The consumer education program shall include goals, objectives and an action plan that is designed to be objective, easily understood, utilizes a uniform measurement as established by the commission for the cost of gas, be available in languages that the commission requires to meet the needs of a service territory and be separate and distinct from marketing. (e) Consumer education cost recovery.-- The consumer education program shall be subject to approval by the commission and shall be funded in each natural gas distribution service territory by a nonbypassable, competitively neutral cost-recovery mechanism that fully recovers the reasonable cost of such program. To the extent that the industrial customer class is not currently assigned such costs on the effective date of this chapter, it shall not be assigned such costs in the future. (f) Tenants' rights.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict the rights of tenants pursuant to Subchapter B of Chapter 15 (relating to discontinuance of service to leased premises).

      "text": "§ 2207. Obligation to serve. (a) Supplier of last resort.-- (1) After the effective date of this chapter, the natural gas distribution company shall serve as the supplier of last resort for residential, small commercial, small industrial and essential human needs customers and any other customer classes determined by the commission in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding until such time as the commission, pursuant to this section, approves an alternative supplier or suppliers to provide such services to any or all of the natural gas distribution company's customers. (2) For purposes of this section, a supplier of last resort is a natural gas distribution company or natural gas supplier which is designated by the commission to provide natural gas supply service with respect to one or more of the following services: (i) natural gas supply services to those customers who have not chosen an alternative natural gas supplier or who choose to be served by their supplier of last resort; (ii) natural gas supply services to those customers who are refused supply service from a natural gas supplier; or (iii) natural gas supply services to those customers whose natural gas supplier has failed to deliver its requirements. No customer shall have more than one supplier of last resort designated for any of the services set forth in this paragraph. (b) Consumer protection.-- Service by the supplier of last resort shall be subject to all consumer protection standards, including those contained in 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service) and to all universal service obligations. (c) Natural gas distribution company.-- The natural gas distribution company shall deliver natural gas to the extent that it is provided by all natural gas suppliers, or suppliers of last resort, as the case may be, in accordance with the natural gas distribution company's tariff. (d) Standards of service.-- Consistent with the standards set forth in section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities) and applicable orders of the commission, a supplier of last resort under subsection (a)(2)(iii) shall provide sufficient supplies as to quantity, quality, pressure and location to meet the operational reliability requirements of the natural gas distribution company's system, including, but not limited to, a failure of one or more natural gas suppliers to: (1) supply natural gas to their retail gas customers in conformance with their contractual obligations to such customers; or (2) satisfy applicable reliability standards and obligations. (e) Discontinuation of service.-- The natural gas distribution company shall continue providing services as the supplier of last resort to all of its customers for all of the natural gas supply services described in subsection (a)(2) unless, at its discretion, it requests and receives commission approval to discontinue providing one or more such supplier of last resort obligation. In approving such a petition, the commission shall also approve another party as the alternative supplier of last resort for each customer or customer group for which the natural gas distribution company no longer provides such natural gas supply services. (f) Regulations.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations setting forth the standards for approving an alternative supplier of last resort consistent with the provisions of this title, including a mechanism to ensure that the rates charged by any alternate supplier of last resort are just and reasonable. (g) Organized labor.-- During the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, approval of an alternative supplier of last resort pursuant to subsection (e) shall not be granted unless the entity designated by the commission to succeed the natural gas distribution company in the provision of service to these customers agrees to recognize relevant union and collective bargaining agreements of the natural gas distribution company then in place. (h) Petition to become supplier of last resort.-- After the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, any party may petition the commission to become the supplier of last resort to some or all customers except for those customers identified in subsection (a)(2)(i). (i) Notice required prior to market exit.-- (1) A natural gas supplier may not exit the market without providing notice as determined by the commission in the restructuring proceeding of the natural gas distribution company to its customers, the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company. (2) If firm gas supply contracts with Pennsylvania natural gas producers or storage or transportation capacity contracts used by the natural gas supplier to serve such retail gas customers were either assigned or released to the natural gas supplier or constitute capacity which was acquired by the natural gas supplier as the result of nonrenewal of a storage or transportation capacity contract previously held by the natural gas distribution company, the natural gas supplier shall offer the supplier of last resort or successor natural gas supplier a right of first refusal to utilize such Pennsylvania supply contracts or storage or transportation capacity contracts at its contract cost as long as needed to serve those customers. (3) If the storage or transportation capacity contracts held by the natural gas supplier were acquired in another manner, and there was not sufficient notice given to the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company, or if there is not alternative storage or transportation capacity available which is operationally sufficient to serve the market the natural gas supplier was serving, then the supplier of last resort shall be provided with a right to use such storage or transportation capacity as designated by the natural gas supplier, at the contract cost, until the supplier of last resort is able to acquire replacement capacity sufficient to serve its customers using reasonable and diligent efforts to do so. (4) If a dispute arises under this subsection, the aggrieved party may file a complaint with the commission for resolution within 45 days. (j) Duty involving lost customers.-- To the extent that a natural gas supplier loses retail gas customers such that its capacity requirements to a natural gas distribution company are reduced below the level established by the commission for such purpose in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, the natural gas supplier shall have the same obligations set forth in subsection (i). (k) Rate after service discontinued.-- In the event the natural gas supplier discontinues service or defaults before its contract with the customer expires, the retail gas customer shall be served by the supplier of last resort at the commission-approved supplier of last resort rate commencing with the next billing cycle. However, the retail gas customer shall continue to be charged the rate the customer negotiated with the discontinuing or defaulting natural gas supplier for the remainder of the billing cycle. Any difference between the cost incurred by the supplier of last resort and the amount payable by the retail gas customer shall be recovered from the natural gas supplier or from the bond or other security provided by the natural gas supplier without recourse to any retail gas customer not otherwise contractually committed for the difference.

      "text": "§ 2208. Requirements for natural gas suppliers. (a) License requirements.-- No entity shall engage in the business of a natural gas supplier unless it holds a license issued by the commission. To the extent that a natural gas distribution company provides natural gas supply service outside of its chartered or certificated territory, it also must hold a license. A license shall not be required for customers who make de minimis incidental sales or resales to themselves, an affiliate or other nonresidential retail gas customers. (b) License application and issuance.-- An application for a natural gas supplier license shall be made to the commission in writing, be verified by oath or affirmation and be in such form and contain such information as the commission may, by rule or order, require. A license shall be issued to any applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the service covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing and able to perform properly the service proposed and to conform to the applicable provisions of this title and the orders and regulations of the commission, including those concerning standards and billing practices, and that the proposed service, to the extent authorized by the license, will be consistent with the public interest. Otherwise, such application shall be denied. (c) Financial fitness.-- (1) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the natural gas supply service in this Commonwealth, no natural gas supplier license shall be issued or remain in force unless the applicant or holder, as the case may be, complies with all of the following: (i) Furnishes a bond or other security in a form and amount to ensure the financial responsibility of the natural gas supplier. The criteria each natural gas distribution company shall use to determine the amount and form of such bond or other security shall be set forth in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring filing. In approving the criteria, commission considerations shall include, but not be limited to, the financial impact on the natural gas distribution company or an alternative supplier of last resort of a default or subsequent bankruptcy of a natural gas supplier. The commission shall periodically review the criteria upon petition by any party. The amount and form of the bond or other security may be mutually agreed to between the natural gas distribution company or the alternate supplier of last resort and the natural gas supplier or, failing that, shall be determined by criteria approved by the commission. (ii) Provides the commission with the address of the participant's principal office in this Commonwealth or the address of the participant's registered agent in this Commonwealth, the latter being the address at which the participant may be served process. (2) Failure of a natural gas supplier to comply with any provision of this chapter or the rules, regulations, orders or directives of the Department of Revenue or of the commission, including, but not limited to, engaging in anticompetitive behavior, shall be cause for the commission to revoke the license of the natural gas supplier. (d) Transferability of licenses.-- No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without prior commission approval. (e) Form of regulation of natural gas suppliers.-- Except where a natural gas supplier serves as a supplier of last resort, the commission may forbear from extending its regulation of natural gas suppliers beyond licensing, bonding, reliability and consumer services and protections, including all applicable portions of 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service). Subject to the provisions of section 2207 (relating to obligation to serve), nothing in this section shall preclude a natural gas supplier, upon appropriate and reasonable notice to the retail gas customer, supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company, from canceling its contract with any customer for legal cause, subject to the customer's right to have continued service from the supplier of last resort. (f) Availability of the service of natural gas suppliers.-- Prior to licensing any natural gas supplier, the commission shall set forth standards to ensure that all customer classes may choose to purchase natural gas from a natural gas supplier. The commission shall also ensure that natural gas suppliers comply with applicable provisions of 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56. (g) Open and nondiscriminatory access.-- In addition to meeting the license requirements applicable to applicants under subsection (b), a municipal corporation shall, before it is permitted to provide natural gas supply services as a natural gas supplier, demonstrate, and the commission shall determine, that, by the date of the issuance of the license, it will provide other natural gas suppliers open and nondiscriminatory access to its gas distribution system under standards that are comparable to this title, taking into consideration the particular circumstances of the municipal corporation's ownership and/or operation of the gas distribution system. (h) Annual fees.-- The commission may establish, by order or rule, on a reasonable cost basis, fees to be charged for annual activities related to the oversight of natural gas suppliers.

(a) Interim standards of conduct.-- Within 120 days of the effective date of this chapter, the commission shall provide by order binding, interim guidelines for standards of conduct governing the activities of and relationships between natural gas distribution companies and their affiliated natural gas suppliers and other natural gas suppliers and monitor and enforce compliance with those standards. (b) Permanent standards of conduct.-- The commission shall thereupon promulgate regulations setting forth permanent standards of conduct governing the activities of and relationships between natural gas distribution companies and their affiliated natural gas suppliers and other natural gas suppliers and monitor and enforce compliance with these standards. The commission shall neither favor nor disfavor conduct or operations by and between a natural gas distribution company and an affiliated natural gas supplier or a nonaffiliated natural gas supplier. (c) Contents of standards.-- Standards of conduct shall provide for: (1) No discrimination against or preferential treatment of any natural gas supplier, including an affiliated natural gas supplier. (2) No disclosure or preferential sharing of any confidential information to or with any individual natural gas supplier. (3) Adequate rules prohibiting cross-subsidization of an affiliated natural gas supplier by a natural gas distribution company.

(e) Initiation of investigations.-- Upon complaint or upon its own motion, for good cause shown, the commission shall conduct an investigation of the impact on the proper functioning of a fully competitive retail natural gas market of mergers, consolidations, acquisition or disposition of assets or securities of natural gas suppliers and anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct affecting the retail distribution of natural gas. (f) Conduct of investigations.-- (1) The commission may require a natural gas supplier to provide information, including documents and testimony, in accordance with the commission's regulations regarding the discovery of information. (2) Material which the commission determines to be confidential, proprietary or trade secret information provided under this subsection shall not be disclosed to any person not directly employed or retained by the commission to conduct the investigation without the consent of the party providing the information. (3) Notwithstanding the prohibition on disclosure of information in paragraph (2), the commission shall disclose information obtained under this subsection to the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate under an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The commission may disclose the information to appropriate Federal or State law enforcement officials if it determines that the disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent or restrain a violation of Federal or State law and it provides the party that provided the information with reasonable notice and opportunity to prevent or limit disclosure. (g) Referrals and investigation.-- If, as a result of the investigation conducted under this section, the commission has reason to believe that anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, is preventing the retail gas customers from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and effectively competitive retail natural gas market, the commission, pursuant to its regulations, shall: (1) Refer its findings to the Attorney General, the United States Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. (2) Subject to subsection (c)(3), disclose any information it has obtained in the course of its investigation to the agency or agencies to which it had made a referral under paragraph (1). (3) Intervene, as provided and permitted by law or regulation, in any proceedings initiated as a result of a referral made under paragraph (1). (h) Marketing standards.-- As part of each natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, the commission may, in its discretion, develop and apply different standards of conduct to the natural gas distribution company's marketing activities related to natural gas supply services. No such standards shall apply to the natural gas distribution company's marketing division or operations until the commission issues an order in the context of that natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding. (i) Definition.-- Subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (h), for the purposes of this section, the term \"affiliated natural gas supplier\" includes marketing activities related to natural gas supply services by the marketing division or the marketing operation of a natural gas distribution company.",

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided under subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g) and section 2212 (relating to city natural gas distribution operations), for a period from the effective date of this chapter until January 1, 2001, the total nongas cost charges of a natural gas distribution company for service to any retail gas customer shall not exceed the maximum nongas cost charges that are contained in the natural gas distribution company's tariff as of the effective date of this chapter. (b) Recovery of deferred costs.-- (1) In a restructuring proceeding, the natural gas distribution company may identify categories of costs resulting from this chapter. (2) The natural gas distribution company may seek permission in its restructuring proceeding to capitalize and to amortize such costs over an appropriate period to be determined by the commission. The amortization shall commence at the time when restructuring orders are issued. The natural gas distribution company may seek recovery of the unamortized balance of such costs in a future rate proceeding, and the commission shall allow recovery of such costs provided that the commission determines that such costs are reasonable and that the resulting rates are just and reasonable. (c) Deferral of costs.-- Costs recoverable under sections 2203(6) (relating to standards for restructuring of natural gas utility industry) and 2206(e) (relating to consumer protections and customer service) in excess of amounts already reflected in a natural gas distribution company's rates, which are incurred between the date of entry of the commission's restructuring order and the earlier of the date on which the commission authorizes commencement of recovery or June 30, 2002, may be deferred for recovery in the future. Such deferrals shall be without interest. (d) Circumstances for exceptions.-- A natural gas distribution company may seek and the commission may approve an exception to the limitations set forth in this section under any of the following circumstances: (1) The natural gas distribution company meets the requirements for extraordinary relief under section 1308(e) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). (2) The natural gas distribution company demonstrates that a rate increase is necessary in order to preserve the reliability of the natural gas distribution system. (3) The natural gas distribution company is subject to significant increases in the rate of Federal taxes or other significant increases in costs resulting from changes in law or regulations that would not allow the natural gas distribution company to earn a fair rate of return. (e) Interclass and intraclass cost shifts.-- Except as provided in section 2212, for the period from the effective date of this chapter until January 1, 2001, interclass or intraclass cost shifts are prohibited. This prohibition against cost shifting may be accomplished by maintaining the cost allocation methodology accepted by the commission for each natural gas distribution company in the company's most recent base rate proceeding. (f) State tax adjustment surcharge.-- The natural gas distribution company, other than a city natural gas distribution operation, shall remain subject to the State tax adjustment surcharge and shall be permitted to adjust its State tax adjustment surcharge mechanism to reflect State tax changes or additions. The natural gas distribution company shall also remain subject to existing riders or surcharges for the collection of nongas transition costs pursuant to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decisions. (g) Provisions relating to interstate pipelines.-- (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if a natural gas distribution company's current base rate revenues reflect the margins realized through the utilization of firm interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to serve the interruptible market when such capacity is not needed to make firm retail deliveries, then the natural gas distribution company shall be permitted to increase base rates and, at the same time, reduce purchased gas cost rates, as described in this chapter. (2) The natural gas distribution company may propose such a change in treatment, consistent with the following requirements: (i) Base rates of customers who pay purchased gas cost rates pursuant to section 1307(f) (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) shall be increased by an amount equal to the margin received for service provided to existing interruptible sales and transportation service customers using capacity reflected in rates established under section 1307(f) based upon the revenue for such services for the most recent 12-month period immediately preceding the application. (ii) Purchased gas cost rates established pursuant to section 1307(f) shall be decreased by an amount equal to the amount by which base rates are increased in subparagraph (i). (iii) Purchased gas cost rates established pursuant to section 1307(f) shall thereafter be reconciled to reflect the margins realized from interruptible sales and interruptible transportation customers utilizing capacity reflected in rates established under section 1307(f). (h) Interstate pipeline transportation.-- (1) Except as specifically set forth in this subsection, nothing in this section or section 2204(d) (relating to implementation) shall prevent a natural gas distribution company from recovering costs paid under the terms of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts which are not fully recovered through a release, assignment or transfer of such capacity to another natural gas supplier if such unrecovered costs arise under the terms of a natural gas transportation pilot program approved by the commission for such company on or before February 1, 1999. (2) Such unrecovered interstate pipeline transportation and capacity costs incurred under such programs through October 31, 2004, may be recovered from a class or classes of customers in accordance with such program provided that the total volumetric charge for such costs does not exceed 1% of the volumetric charge for residential natural gas sales service set forth in the natural gas distribution company's tariff in effect at the time. (3) With respect to such pilot programs, the commission may determine to extend such programs to include all customers of that company pursuant to the requirements of this chapter, and nothing in this section or section 2204(d) shall prevent unrecovered interstate pipeline and transportation capacity costs incurred through October 31, 2004, under such programs from being recovered in accordance with such programs provided that the total volumetric charge for such costs does not exceed the 1% limit specified in paragraph (2) for pilot programs.",

(b) Commission jurisdiction.-- Subject to the provisions of this section, commencing July 1, 2000, public utility service being furnished or rendered by a city natural gas distribution operation within its municipal limits shall be subject to regulation and control by the commission with the same force as if the service were rendered by a public utility. (c) Applicability of other chapters.-- Commencing July 1, 2000, to the extent not inconsistent with this section, the provisions of this title, other than Chapters 11 (relating to certificates of public convenience), 19 (relating to securities and obligations) and 21 (relating to relations with affiliated interests), shall apply to the public utility service of a city natural gas distribution operation with the same force as if the city natural gas distribution operation was a public utility under section 102 (relating to definitions), provided that, upon request of a city natural gas distribution operation, the commission may suspend or waive the application to a city natural gas distribution operation of any provision of this title, including any provision of this chapter other than this section. Chapter 11 shall apply to a city natural gas distribution operation to the extent it seeks to provide natural gas distribution services outside of its corporate or municipal limits. Chapter 19 shall apply to issuances of securities for the benefit of a city natural gas distribution operation by an issuer other than a city to the extent provided in subsection (e) but shall not apply to issuances of securities by a city. (d) Continuation of tariff.-- For purposes of this section, prior tariff means the tariff, rate schedule and riders incorporated into the tariff of a city natural gas distribution operation on the date the commission assumes jurisdiction over such city natural gas distribution operation. A city natural gas distribution operation shall continue to provide natural gas supply and natural gas distribution services to its customers under the prior tariff and the policies or programs existing on the date that the commission assumes jurisdiction over the city natural gas distribution operation until the effective date of the final order entered by the commission approving the restructuring plan and new tariff of the city natural gas distribution operations unless such effective date has been stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, in which event the prior tariff will continue in force until such stay has been dissolved. Where the prior tariff refers to, incorporates or includes a local commission, it shall be interpreted as referring to, incorporating or including the commission. Subject to subsection (s), the commission shall resolve all questions, disputes or conflicts arising under the prior tariff. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent a city natural gas distribution operation from requesting or, if so requested, the commission from approving modifications to the prior tariff at any time prior to the effective date of the final order approving the restructuring plan and new tariff. (e) Securities of city natural gas distribution operations.-- Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, in determining the city natural gas distribution operation's revenue requirement and approving overall rates and charges, the commission shall follow the same ratemaking methodology and requirements that were applicable to the city natural gas distribution operation prior to the assumption of jurisdiction by the commission, and such obligation shall continue until the date on which all approved bonds have been retired, redeemed, advance refunded or otherwise defeased. However, this section shall not prevent the commission from approving changes in the rates payable by any class of ratepayers of the city natural gas distribution operation so long as the revenue requirement and the overall rates and charges are not adversely affected by such changes. Notwithstanding any provision in this title to the contrary, the commission shall permit the city natural gas distribution operation to impose, charge or collect rates or charges as necessary to permit the city or municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) that issued bonds on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation to comply with its covenants to the holders of any approved bonds. Notwithstanding any provision in this title to the contrary, the commission shall not require a city natural gas distribution operation to take action, or omit taking any actions, pursuant to this title if such action or omission would have the effect of causing the interest on tax-exempt bonds issued by a city or municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation to be includable in the gross income of the holders of such bonds for Federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this section, approved bonds shall mean all bonds: (1) issued by a city on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation under the act of October 18, 1972 (P.L.955, No.234), known as The First Class City Revenue Bond Act, or the act of December 7, 1982 (P.L.827, No.231), known as The City of Philadelphia Municipal Utility Inventory and Receivables Financing Act, that were issued and outstanding on the date the commission assumed jurisdiction over the city natural gas distribution operation; (2) issued by the city after the date the commission assumed jurisdiction over the city natural gas distribution operation unless the governing body of the city, at the time of approval of the bond issuance, determines that such bonds shall not be approved bonds; (3) issued by the city or a municipal authority, nonprofit corporation or public corporation formed pursuant to subsection (m) for the purpose of refunding, redeeming, repaying or otherwise defeasing approved bonds; or (4) issued by a municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) for purposes other than refunding, redeeming, repaying or otherwise defeasing approved bonds unless the commission determines, at the time of the registration of a securities certificate pursuant to section 1903 (relating to registration or rejection of securities certificates), that the bonds should not be approved bonds. Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, a city owning a city natural gas distribution operation may continue to issue bonds on behalf of the city natural gas distribution operation pursuant to The First Class City Revenue Bond Act and under The City of Philadelphia Municipal Utility Inventory and Receivables Financing Act, and any municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) may issue bonds on behalf of the city natural gas distribution operation pursuant to the act of May 2, 1945 (P.L.382, No.164), known as the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945, and as otherwise provided by law. All documents that are required to be submitted to the governing body of the city by The First Class City Revenue Bond Act or The City of Philadelphia Municipal Utility Inventory and Receivables Financing Act or, in the case of an issuance of securities by a municipal authority, the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945 shall also be submitted to the commission for its information. Any issuance of securities by a municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation, other than issuances of bonds for the purpose of refunding, redeeming, repaying or otherwise defeasing approved bonds, shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 19 provided that commission determinations with respect to the registration of a securities certificate under Chapter 19 for the issuance of securities by a municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) shall be determinations with respect to public debt and the commission shall employ its abbreviated securities certificate process to such issuances. (f) Transfers to city.-- The commission shall permit the city natural gas distribution operation to impose, charge or collect rates and charges as necessary to permit the city natural gas distribution operation to transfer or pay to the city that is the owner of the city natural gas distribution operation, on an annual basis, such amount as may be specified from time to time in the applicable ordinances of the city or agreements of the city approved by ordinances. If the amount so specified shall exceed 110% of the amount that was authorized for transfer or payment to the city at the close of the fiscal year of the city ending June 30, 2000, such additional amount shall be subject to review and approval of the commission, which approval shall be given unless such additional amount would not be just and reasonable. (g) Restructuring and tariff filings.-- A city natural gas distribution operation shall file with the commission an initial tariff and a restructuring filing consistent with this chapter, and with any orders, rules or regulations adopted by the commission after the effective date of this chapter no later than July 1, 2002, and, unless the city natural gas operation agrees, no earlier than December 31, 2001, pursuant to a schedule to be determined by the commission in consultation with a city natural gas distribution operation. The commission shall conduct an initial rate proceeding pursuant to its procedures for such filings. Hearings on the tariff and restructuring filings shall be held within the municipal limits of the city in which the city natural gas distribution operation is located to the extent practicable. (h) Restructuring proceedings.-- In the restructuring proceeding of a city natural gas distribution operation, in addition to the requirements of section 2204(c) (relating to implementation): (1) The city natural gas distribution operation shall file a plan to convert its existing information technology, accounting, billing, collection, gas purchasing and other operating systems and procedures to comply with the requirements applicable to jurisdictional natural gas utilities under this title and the applicable rules, regulations and orders. The commission shall examine the cost and burdens of converting existing systems and procedures of a city natural gas distribution operation to meet the requirements of this title generally applicable to natural gas distribution companies. If requested by the city natural gas distribution operation, the commission shall determine whether the cost of conversion of any system or procedure is prudent in light of the benefits to be obtained. In the event that the commission determines that the costs would not be prudent, it may waive application to the city natural gas distribution operation of any provision of this title or the commission's rules, regulations and orders as appropriate. In the event that the commission determines that such costs should be incurred, the commission shall permit the city natural gas distribution operation to fully recover such costs through a nonbypassable charge imbedded in the distribution rates of the city natural gas distribution operation. (2) In its restructuring proceeding, a city natural gas distribution operation may propose an automatic adjustment mechanism or mechanisms in lieu of or as a supplement to section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) to adjust rates for fluctuations in gas and nongas costs, including, but not limited to, an automatic adjustment mechanism or mechanisms to recover the costs of providing programs for low-income ratepayers and other assisted ratepayers. The commission may approve or modify the automatic adjustment mechanism or mechanisms proposed by the city natural gas distribution operation, or the commission may approve a section 1307 adjustment for a city natural gas distribution operation. However, the automatic adjustment mechanism, whether section 1307 or any alternative proposed by the city natural gas distribution operation, utilized for city natural gas distribution operations must enable the city or municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) that issued bonds on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation to fully comply at all times with its covenants to the holders of any approved bonds. (i) Powers of the Consumer Advocate; Small Business Advocate.-- The Consumer Advocate shall represent the interests of consumers as a party, or otherwise participate for the purpose of representing an interest of consumers, before the commission in any matter properly before the commission relating to a city natural gas distribution operation. The Consumer Advocate is authorized, in addition to any other authority conferred on him, to represent an interest of consumers which is presented to him for his consideration upon petition in writing by a substantial number of persons who make, direct, use or are ultimate recipients of a product or services supplied by a city natural gas distribution operation. The Small Business Advocate shall represent the interest of small business consumers as a party, or otherwise participate for the purpose of representing an interest of small business consumers, before the commission in any matter properly before the commission relating to a city natural gas distribution operation. The Small Business Advocate is authorized, in addition to any other authority conferred on him, to represent an interest of small business consumers which is presented to him for his consideration upon petition in writing by a substantial number of small business consumers who make, direct, use or are ultimate recipients of a product or services supplied by a city natural gas distribution operation. (j) Commencement of customer choice.-- Beginning with the commencement of the first fiscal year of a city natural gas distribution operation after the order approving the restructuring plan of a city natural gas distribution operation becomes effective, all retail gas customers of city natural gas distribution operations shall have the opportunity to purchase natural gas supply services from a natural gas supplier or the city natural gas distribution operation to the extent it offers the service. After that date, the choice of natural gas suppliers shall rest with the retail gas customer. (k) City instrumentality.-- Unless and until the governing body of a city that owns a city natural gas distribution operation otherwise provides: (1) a city natural gas distribution operation shall be deemed an instrumentality of the city that owns it and independently authorized to establish and maintain pension, welfare and other employee benefit plans for the benefit of those individuals who render services in connection with its operations; and (2) for the purpose of being a participant in such plans or programs, those individuals who render services exclusively and directly related to the operations of the city natural gas distribution operation shall be deemed employees of the city natural gas distribution operation as a distinct entity from the city. If any pension plan established and maintained by or on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation is or becomes subject to the act of December 18, 1984 (P.L.1005, No.205), known as the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act, the provisions of Chapters 5 and 6 of that act (relating to financially distressed municipal pension system recovery programs) shall not require any pension plan of a city natural gas distribution operation to be aggregated with any pension plan established and maintained by the city. (l) Assisted cities.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, no assisted city shall be required to take any action under this title if the effect of the action is to cause a variation in the financial plan of such assisted city approved pursuant to section 209 of the act of June 5, 1991 (P.L.9, No.6), known as the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority Act for Cities of the First Class. As used in this subsection, \"assisted city\" and \"variation\" shall have the meanings set forth or construed in the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority Act for Cities of the First Class. (m) Corporate action.-- A city that owns a city natural gas distribution operation may form a nonprofit corporation or public corporation or municipal authority under the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945 in order to own, manage, operate, lease or carry out natural gas supply and/or distribution services for, in place of or on behalf of the city natural gas distribution operation, provided that no such entity shall provide natural gas supply services outside of the municipal limits of the city unless licensed as a natural gas supplier. Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c), if a city forms an entity pursuant to this section to provide natural gas supply services, whether inside or outside of the city, the entity shall be deemed an affiliated interest of the city natural gas distribution operation, and Chapter 21 shall apply with respect to that affiliated interest. A municipal authority formed pursuant to the authorization of this section shall not exercise the power of eminent domain outside of the municipal limits of the city in which it is seated. Any entity created under this section or otherwise to own, manage, operate, lease or carry out natural gas supply and/or distribution services for or on behalf of a city or a city natural gas distribution operation shall be deemed a local agency for purposes of 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 85 (relating to matters affecting government units). (n) Collections.-- Nothing contained in this title shall abrogate the power of a city natural gas distribution operation to collect delinquent receivables through the imposition of liens pursuant to section 3 of the act of May 16, 1923 (P.L.207, No.153), referred to as the Municipal Claim and Tax Lien Law, or otherwise. (o) Existing customer contracts.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, where an agreement for natural gas service, evidenced by a signed writing between a city natural gas distribution operation and any customer, exists prior to the date the commission assumes jurisdiction over a city natural gas distribution operation, the customer shall be bound by its terms and conditions and shall not have the right to receive natural gas service from another source until the expiration of the term of the agreement or otherwise pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement. (p) License application and issuance.-- A city natural gas distribution operation may apply for a license pursuant to the procedures under section 2208 (relating to requirements for natural gas suppliers). Subject to the requirement that it qualify for and obtain a natural gas supplier's license under section 2208, a city natural gas distribution operation is authorized to engage in the business of a natural gas supplier outside its municipal or corporate limits. (q) Commission assessment.-- In order to ensure that the commission will be able to carry out its obligations with respect to city natural gas operations, the chief executive officer of a city natural gas distribution operation shall file, no later than March 31, 2000, a sworn statement showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the immediately preceding fiscal year in the same manner as required by section 510(b) (relating to assessment for regulatory expenses upon public utilities). The commission shall use such revenues in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 510(b) and shall bill, no earlier than July 1, 2000, each city natural gas distribution operation its proportional share of the commission's expenses pursuant to section 510(b)(4). A city natural gas distribution operation shall pay the resulting assessment in accordance with and subject to the provisions contained in section 510. (r) Senior citizens.-- (1) The commission may approve a program designed to provide discounted rates for natural gas distribution and supply services to senior citizens residing in the service territory of a city natural gas distribution operation provided that such rates and the terms of such program are just and reasonable. (2) Individual ratepayers who, as of the date the initial tariff of a city natural gas distribution operation becomes effective pursuant to subsection (d), are properly receiving discounted gas rates pursuant to the terms of a program specifically designed to provide assistance to senior citizens contained in the prior tariff shall be entitled to continue to receive such discount under the terms of the prior tariff unless and until the program is modified by ordinance of the governing body of the city, in which event such individuals shall be entitled to receive only the discount provided under the terms of the modified program, as it may be further modified by ordinance from time to time thereafter. (3) Nothing in this title shall require the commission to approve the continuation of the program identified in paragraph (2) in whole or part for any person other than an individual identified in paragraph (2). (s) Powers preserved.-- Nothing contained in this title shall be construed to abrogate or limit the executive or legislative powers of a city that owns a city natural gas distribution operation to legislate or otherwise determine the powers, functions, budgets, activities and mission of the city natural gas distribution operation or any related entity created under subsection (m), including, but not limited to, the ownership, governance, management or control thereof. Nothing in this title shall limit or prevent the proper city officials and agencies from conducting audits and examinations of the financial affairs of the city natural gas distribution operation in accordance with their official duties. (t) Proprietary information.-- Proprietary information, trade secrets and competitively sensitive information of a city natural gas distribution operation shall not be public records for purposes of the act of June 21, 1957 (P.L.390, No.212), referred to as the Right-to-Know Law, and shall not be subject to mandatory public disclosure. Nothing in this section shall exempt a city natural gas distribution operation from providing information to the commission pursuant to its obligation under sections 501 (relating to general powers), 504 (relating to reports by public utilities), 505 (relating to duty to furnish information to commission; cooperation in valuing property) and 506 (relating to inspection of facilities and records).

(5) Coverage under an automobile insurance policy maintained under this section shall be primary and not be dependent on a personal automobile insurer first denying a claim nor shall a personal automobile insurance policy be required to first deny a claim. (6) The automobile insurance required for a transportation network company under paragraph (4) shall be evidenced by the filing of a certificate of insurance. The certificate of insurance must be filed, with the commission, by the insurance carrier and must be in the form specified by the commission by order or regulation. (7) Insurance required under this subsection shall be placed with an insurer that has obtained a certificate of authority under section 208 of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.789, No.285), known as The Insurance Department Act of 1921, or a surplus lines insurer eligible under section 1605 of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.682, No.284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (8) Insurance satisfying the requirements of this section shall be deemed to satisfy the financial responsibility requirement for a motor vehicle under 75 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17 (relating to financial responsibility). (9) A transportation network company driver shall carry proof of coverage satisfying paragraphs (2) and (3) when the driver uses a vehicle in connection with a digital network. In the event of an accident, a transportation network company driver shall provide the proof of insurance coverage to the directly interested parties, automobile insurers and investigating police officers under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1786 (relating to required financial responsibility). A transportation network company driver shall also disclose to directly interested parties, automobile insurers and investigating police officers whether the driver was logged on to the digital network or on a prearranged ride at the time of an accident. (10) It shall be the sole and exclusive responsibility of a transportation network company to ensure that automobile insurance coverage required to be carried by the transportation network company driver under this section is in force prior to permitting a transportation network company driver to provide transportation network service. (b) Automobile insurance provisions.-- (1) Insurers that write automobile insurance in this Commonwealth may exclude any and all coverage afforded under the policy issued to an owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any loss or injury that occurs while a driver is logged on to a digital network or while a driver provides a prearranged ride. The right to exclude all coverage may apply to any coverage included in an automobile insurance policy, including, but not limited to: (i) liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage; (ii) uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage; (iii) medical payments coverage; (iv) comprehensive physical damage coverage; (v) collision physical damage coverage; and (vi) first-party medical benefits required under subsection (a)(2)(ii). (2) Notwithstanding any requirement under 75 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17, exclusions under paragraph (1) shall apply. Nothing in this section shall require that a personal automobile insurance policy provide coverage while the driver is logged on to a digital network, while the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride or while the driver otherwise uses a vehicle to transport passengers for compensation. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to preclude an insurer from providing coverage for the personal vehicle if the insurer chooses to do so by contract or endorsement. (3) Automobile insurers that exclude the coverage described in paragraph (1) shall have no duty to defend or indemnify any claim expressly excluded under the coverage. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to invalidate or limit an exclusion contained in a personal insurance policy, including any policy in use or approved for use in this Commonwealth prior to the enactment of this section, that excludes coverage for vehicles used to carry persons or property for a charge or available for hire by the public. (4) An automobile insurer that defends or indemnifies a claim against a driver that is excluded under the terms of its policy shall have a right of contribution against other insurers that provide automobile insurance to the same driver in satisfaction of the coverage requirements of subsection (a) at the time of loss. (5) In a claims coverage investigation, transportation network companies and any insurer potentially providing coverage under subsection (a) shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange of relevant information with directly involved parties and any insurer of the transportation network company driver, if applicable, including the precise times that a transportation network company driver logged on and logged off of the digital network in the 12-hour period immediately preceding and in the 12-hour period immediately following the accident and disclose a clear description of the coverage, exclusions and limits provided under any automobile insurance maintained under subsection (a). (c) Waiver of liability prohibited.-- (1) A transportation network company or transportation network company driver may not request or require a passenger to sign a waiver of potential liability for a loss of personal property or injury. (2) A transportation network company may not request or require a transportation network company driver to sign a waiver of potential liability for a loss of personal property or injury. (3) For the purposes of this subsection, signing a waiver shall include requiring a prospective customer to agree to the terms and conditions required to download a digital application as a condition for obtaining transportation network services.

(a) Acknowledgment of lien and lease obligations.-- (1) A transportation network company shall disclose the following prominently and with a separate acknowledgment of acceptance to all prospective transportation network company drivers in its written terms of service for drivers. The disclosure shall be provided before a driver is allowed to offer prearranged rides on a transportation network company's digital network: (Name of transportation network company) will provide you with a notice explaining whether it provides insurance to repair your personal vehicle if you have an accident when using your vehicle in a transportation network. If (name of transportation network company) does not provide coverage for damage to your car, your personal automobile insurance policy might not provide the coverage and you may be required to pay all costs to repair the vehicle yourself in the event of an accident unless you purchase extra insurance. If you financed the purchase of the vehicle or lease the vehicle, you must notify your lender or lessor that you will use your vehicle to provide transportation network service. Your lender or lessor may require you to purchase extra insurance coverage or, if you do not do so, may purchase insurance on your behalf and bill you for the costs of the policy. The failure to notify a lender or lessor or to have insurance to cover the cost of damage to the vehicle may cause your vehicle to be repossessed or your lease to be revoked. If you have questions about this notice, you should contact your insurance agent, your lender or lessor or the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. (2) A transportation network company shall provide the notice required under paragraph (1) upon any subsequent material reduction in insurance coverage by the company. For purposes of this paragraph, \"material reduction in insurance coverage\" shall not include the replacement of insurance coverage with substantially similar insurance coverage from a different insurer by a transportation network company. (3) A transportation network company shall notify drivers in writing whether it is providing comprehensive and collision coverage during service. (b) Payment of damage claims.-- If a transportation network company's insurer makes a payment for a claim covered under comprehensive or collision coverage, the transportation network company shall cause its insurer to issue the payment directly to the business repairing the vehicle or jointly to the owner of the vehicle and the primary lienholder or lessor. (c) Direct placement of insurance.-- If a driver of a personal vehicle used in transportation network service that is subject to a lien or lease fails to maintain comprehensive or collision damage coverage required by the lienholder or lessor, or to show evidence to the lienholder or lessor of the coverage upon reasonable request, the lienholder or lessor may obtain the coverage at the expense of the driver without prior notice to the driver.

      "text": "§ 2802. Declaration of policy. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) Over the past 20 years, the Federal Government and State government have introduced competition in several industries that previously had been regulated as natural monopolies. (2) Many state governments are implementing or studying policies that would create a competitive market for the generation of electricity. (3) Because of advances in electric generation technology and Federal initiatives to encourage greater competition in the wholesale electric market, it is now in the public interest to permit retail customers to obtain direct access to a competitive generation market as long as safe and affordable transmission and distribution service is available at levels of reliability that are currently enjoyed by the citizens and businesses of this Commonwealth. (4) Rates for electricity in this Commonwealth are on average higher than the national average, and significant differences exist among the rates of Pennsylvania electric utilities. (5) Competitive market forces are more effective than economic regulation in controlling the cost of generating electricity. (6) The cost of electricity is an important factor in decisions made by businesses concerning locating, expanding and retaining facilities in this Commonwealth. (7) This Commonwealth must begin the transition from regulation to greater competition in the electricity generation market to benefit all classes of customers and to protect this Commonwealth's ability to compete in the national and international marketplace for industry and jobs. (8) In moving toward greater competition in the electricity generation market, the Commonwealth must resolve certain transitional issues in a manner that is fair to customers, electric utilities, investors, the employees of electric utilities, local communities, nonutility generators of electricity and other affected parties. (9) Electric service is essential to the health and well-being of residents, to public safety and to orderly economic development, and electric service should be available to all customers on reasonable terms and conditions. (10) The Commonwealth must, at a minimum, continue the protections, policies and services that now assist customers who are low-income to afford electric service. (11) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the electric system, ensure the continued provision of high-quality customer service and avoid economic dislocation, utilities shall consider the experience and expertise of their work force in moving towards competition. (12) The purpose of this chapter is to modify existing legislation and regulations and to establish standards and procedures in order to create direct access by retail customers to the competitive market for the generation of electricity while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system for all parties. Reliable electric service is of the utmost importance to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. Electric industry restructuring should ensure the reliability of the interconnected electric system by maintaining the efficiency of the transmission and distribution system. (13) Under current law and regulation there exists some competition in the wholesale market for the generation of electricity, but the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sale of electricity is provided generally by public utilities under bundled rates regulated by the commission. The procedures established under this chapter provide for a fair and orderly transition from the current regulated structure to a structure under which retail customers will have direct access to a competitive market for the generation and sale or purchase of electricity. (14) This chapter requires electric utilities to unbundle their rates and services and to provide open access over their transmission and distribution systems to allow competitive suppliers to generate and sell electricity directly to consumers in this Commonwealth. The generation of electricity will no longer be regulated as a public utility function except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. Electric generation suppliers will be required to obtain licenses, demonstrate financial responsibility and comply with such other requirements concerning service as the commission deems necessary for the protection of the public. (15) In establishing the standards for the transition to and creation of a competitive electric market, heretofore, public utilities generally have had an obligation to serve customers within their defined service territories; consistent with that obligation, have undertaken long-term investments in generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to meet the needs of their customers; and have entered into long-term power supply agreements as required by Federal law. In many instances, these investments and agreements have created costs which may not be recoverable in a competitive market. The commission is empowered under this chapter to determine the level of transition or stranded costs for each electric utility and to provide a mechanism, the competitive transition charge, for recovery of an appropriate amount of such costs in accordance with the standards established in this chapter. (16) It is in the public interest for the transmission and distribution of electricity to continue to be regulated as a natural monopoly subject to the jurisdiction and active supervision of the commission. Electric distribution companies should continue to be the provider of last resort in order to ensure the availability of universal electric service in this Commonwealth unless another provider of last resort is approved by the commission. (17) There are certain public purpose costs, including programs for low-income assistance, energy conservation and others, which have been implemented and supported by public utilities' bundled rates. The public purpose is to be promoted by continuing universal service and energy conservation policies, protections and services, and full recovery of such costs is to be permitted through a nonbypassable rate mechanism. (18) There are certain changes to a utility which will create transition costs to accomplish the move to a competitive market. These changes may entail the closure of facilities or reduction in employee levels. If such actions are to be undertaken, the utility must fully inform the commission of the impact of such decisions on local communities and on social services and of any tax implications of the actions. The utility is expected to discuss the transition to competition with its employees or their certified representatives and may provide severance, retraining, early retirement and outplacement services. Such transition costs may be recoverable under the competitive transition charge in section 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge). (19) All participants in the restructured electric industry are encouraged to coordinate their plans and transactions through an independent system operator or its functional equivalent. (20) Since continuing and ensuring the reliability of electric service depends on adequate generation and on conscientious inspection and maintenance of transmission and distribution systems, the independent system operator or its functional equivalent should set, and the commission shall set through regulations, inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement standards and enforce those standards. (21) Under Federal and State clean air laws and regulations, electricity generators located in states to the west and south of this Commonwealth are not subject to requirements as stringent as those which apply to generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the act of January 8, 1960 (1959 P.L.2119, No.787), known as the Air Pollution Control Act, operating in this Commonwealth and that different regions within this Commonwealth are subject to varying air emission requirements. Under some scenarios, competition among electricity generators located in different states and different regions within this Commonwealth could make it more difficult for areas in this Commonwealth to demonstrate attainment with Federal and State air quality standards. Since this result may be caused by the disparate requirements imposed by Federal and State law on generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act in this Commonwealth and generators located in other states, the General Assembly supports changes to Federal clean air laws and regulations that will protect Pennsylvania's environment and ensure that electricity generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act located in this Commonwealth are not placed at an undue competitive disadvantage. The commission will consult with the Department of Environmental Protection regarding this issue during the transition to retail competition. Cross References.

      "text": "§ 2804. Standards for restructuring of electric industry. The following interdependent standards shall govern the commission's assessment and approval of each public utility's restructuring plan, oversight of the transition process and regulation of the restructured electric utility industry: (1) The commission shall ensure continuation of safe and reliable electric service to all consumers in the Commonwealth, including: (i) The maintenance of adequate reserve margins by electric suppliers in conformity with the standards required by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and the regional reliability council appropriate to each supplier, or any successors to those reliability entities, and in conformity with established industry standards and practices. (ii) The installation and maintenance of transmission and distribution facilities in conformity with established industry standards and practices, including the standards set forth in the National Electric Safety Code. (2) Consistent with the time line set forth in section 2806 (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates), the commission shall allow customers to choose among electric generation suppliers in a competitive generation market through direct access. Customers should be able to choose among alternatives such as firm and interruptible service, flexible pricing and alternate generation sources, including reasonable and fair opportunities to self-generate and interconnect. These alternatives may be provided by different electric generation suppliers. (3) The commission shall require the unbundling of electric utility services, tariffs and customer bills to separate the charges for generation, transmission and distribution. The commission may require the unbundling of other services. (4) The following caps on electric utility rates shall apply: (i) For a period of 54 months from the effective date of this chapter or until an electric distribution utility is no longer recovering its transition or stranded costs through a competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge and all the customers of an electric distribution utility can choose an alternative provider of electric generation, whichever is shorter: (A) the total charges of an electric distribution utility for service to any customer who purchases generation from that utility shall not exceed the total charges that have been approved by the commission for such service as of the effective date of this chapter; and (B) for customers who purchase generation from a supplier other than the electric distribution utility, the charges of the utility for non-generation services that are regulated as of the effective date of this chapter, exclusive of the competitive transition charge and intangible transition charge, shall not exceed the non-generation charges that have been approved by the commission for such service as of the effective date of this chapter. (ii) In addition to the rate cap set forth in subparagraph (i), for a period of nine years from the effective date of this chapter or until an electric distribution utility is no longer recovering its transition or stranded costs through a competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge and all customers of an electric distribution utility can choose an alternative provider of electric generation, whichever is shorter, the generation component of a utility's charges to customers who purchase generation from the utility, including the competitive transition charge and intangible transition charge, shall not exceed the generation component charged to the customers that has been approved by the commission for such service as of the effective date of this chapter. (iii) An electric distribution utility may seek, and the commission may approve, an exception to the limitations set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) only in any of the following circumstances: (A) The electric distribution utility meets the requirements for extraordinary rate relief under section 1308(e) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). (B) Either the electric distribution utility is required to begin payment under contracts with nonutility generation projects that have received commission orders, has been unable to mitigate such costs, such costs are not recoverable in a competitive generation market and such costs were not previously covered in the competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge, or the utility prudently incurs costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation of nonutility generating project obligations of the utility consistent with section 527 (relating to cogeneration rules and regulations) and such costs were not previously covered in the competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge. Costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation shall be recovered from ratepayers over a period not to exceed three years, unless the commission determines within its discretion to require a longer recovery period due to the magnitude of such costs, but shall be accounted for by the utility on a levelized basis over the total period in which the generation portion of the utility's rates are capped. (C) The electric distribution utility is subject to significant increases in the rates of Federal or State taxes or other significant changes in law or regulations that would not allow the utility to earn a fair rate of return. (D) The electric distribution utility is subject to significant increases in the unit rate of fuel for utility generation or the price of purchased power that are outside of the control of the utility and that would not allow the utility to earn a fair rate of return. (E) The electric distribution utility is directed by the commission or an independent system operator or its functional equivalent to make expenditures to repair or upgrade its transmission or distribution system. (F) The electric distribution utility seeks to increase its allowance for nuclear decommissioning costs to reflect new information not available at the time the utility's existing rates were determined, and such costs are not recoverable in the competitive generation market and are not covered in the competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge, and such costs would not allow the utility to earn a fair rate of return. (G) As permitted by paragraph (16). (iv) Consistent with the requirements of due process, the commission may expedite proceedings that invoke the provisions of subparagraph (iii). (v) If an electric distribution utility rolls its energy cost rate into base rates at a combined level that does not exceed its combined level of such rates which have been approved by the commission as of the effective date of this chapter, the utility shall not be required to reduce its capped rates below the capped level upon the complaint of any party if the commission determines that any excess earnings achieved under the cap are being utilized to mitigate transition or stranded costs for the benefit of ratepayers or to offset other known and measurable cost increases that would be recoverable under traditional ratemaking but are not included within the capped rates. (vi) This paragraph shall not apply to new services offered for the first time after the effective date of this chapter. (5) The commission may permit, but shall not require, an electric utility to divest itself of facilities or to reorganize its corporate structure. (6) Consistent with the provision of section 2806, the commission shall require that a public utility that owns or operates jurisdictional transmission and distribution facilities shall provide transmission and distribution service to all retail electric customers in their service territory and to electric cooperative corporations and electric generation suppliers, affiliated or nonaffiliated, on rates, terms of access and conditions that are comparable to the utility's own use of its system. (7) The commission shall require that restructuring of the electric utility industry be implemented in a manner that does not unreasonably discriminate against one customer class to the benefit of another. (8) The commission shall establish for each electric utility an appropriate cost-recovery mechanism which is designed to fully recover the electric utility's universal service and energy conservation costs over the life of these programs. (9) The commission shall ensure that universal service and energy conservation policies, activities and services are appropriately funded and available in each electric distribution territory. Policies, activities and services under this paragraph shall be funded in each electric distribution territory by nonbypassable, competitively neutral cost-recovery mechanisms that fully recover the costs of universal service and energy conservation services. The commission shall encourage the use of community-based organizations that have the necessary technical and administrative experience to be the direct providers of services or programs which reduce energy consumption or otherwise assist low-income customers to afford electric service. Programs under this paragraph shall be subject to the administrative oversight of the commission which will ensure that the programs are operated in a cost-effective manner. (10) The commission shall establish rates for jurisdictional transmission and distribution services and shall continue to regulate distribution services for new and existing customers in accordance with this chapter and Chapter 13 (relating to rates and rate making).

      "text": "§ 2807. Duties of electric distribution companies. (a) General rule.-- Each electric distribution company shall maintain the integrity of the distribution system at least in conformity with the National Electric Safety Code and such other standards practiced by the industry in a manner sufficient to provide safe and reliable service to all customers connected to the system consistent with this title and the commission's regulations. In performing such duties, the electric distribution company shall implement procedures to require all electric generation suppliers to deliver energy to the electric distribution company at locations and in amounts which are adequate to meet the energy supplier's obligations to its customers. Subject to commission approval, the electric distribution company may require that the customer install, at the customer's expense, enhanced metering capability sufficient to match the energy delivered by the electric generation suppliers with consumption by the customer. (b) Procedures for review by the commission.-- There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the electric distribution company has the ability to receive energy at all points on its system sufficient to meet the needs of all electric generation suppliers' customers on its system. The electric distribution company shall not have an obligation to install nonstandard facilities, either as to type or location, for the purpose of receiving energy from the energy supplier unless the energy supplier or its customer pays the full cost of these facilities. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the electric distribution company from upgrading its system to meet changing customer requirements consistent with the requirements of section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities), and the commission may establish incentive programs to encourage such system upgrades. Disputes concerning facilities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission and may be initiated by the filing of a complaint under section 701 (relating to complaints) by the electric generation supplier or the customer. (c) Customer billing.-- Subject to the right of an end-use customer to choose to receive separate bills from its electric generation supplier, the electric distribution company may be responsible for billing customers for all electric services, consistent with the regulations of the commission, regardless of the identity of the provider of those services. (1) Customer bills shall contain unbundled charges sufficient to enable the customer to determine the basis for those charges. (2) If services are provided by an entity other than the electric distribution company, the entity that provides those services shall furnish to the electric distribution company billing data sufficient to enable the electric distribution company to bill customers. (3) The electric distribution company shall not be required to forward payment to entities providing services to customers, and on whose behalf the electric distribution company is billing those customers, before the electric distribution company has received payment for those services from customers. (d) Consumer protections and customer service.-- The electric distribution company shall continue to provide customer service functions consistent with the regulations of the commission, including meter reading, complaint resolution and collections. Customer services shall, at a minimum, be maintained at the same level of quality under retail competition. (1) The commission shall establish regulations to ensure that an electric distribution company does not change a customer's electricity supplier without direct oral confirmation from the customer of record or written evidence of the customer's consent to a change of supplier. (2) The commission shall establish regulations to require each electric distribution company, electricity supplier, marketer, aggregator and broker to provide adequate and accurate customer information to enable customers to make informed choices regarding the purchase of all electricity services offered by that provider. Information shall be provided to consumers in an understandable format that enables consumers to compare prices and services on a uniform basis. (3) Prior to the implementation of any restructuring plan under section 2806 (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates), each electric distribution company, in conjunction with the commission, shall implement a consumer education program informing customers of the changes in the electric utility industry. The program shall provide consumers with information necessary to help them make appropriate choices as to their electric service. The education program shall be subject to approval by the commission. (e) Obligation to serve.-- A default service provider's obligation to provide electric generation supply service following the expiration of a generation rate cap specified under section 2804(4) (relating to standards for restructuring of electric industry) or a restructuring plan under section 2806(f) is revised as follows: (1) While an electric distribution company collects either a competitive transition charge or an intangible transition charge or until 100% of its customers have choice, whichever is longer, the electric distribution company shall continue to have the full obligation to serve, including the connection of customers, the delivery of electric energy and the production or acquisition of electric energy for customers. (2) (Deleted by amendment). (3) (Deleted by amendment). (3.1) Following the expiration of an electric distribution company's obligation to provide electric generation supply service to retail customers at capped rates, if a customer contracts for electric generation supply service and the chosen electric generation supplier does not provide the service or if a customer does not choose an alternative electric generation supplier, the default service provider shall provide electric generation supply service to that customer pursuant to a commission-approved competitive procurement plan. The electric power acquired shall be procured through competitive procurement processes and shall include one or more of the following: (i) Auctions. (ii) Requests for proposal. (iii) Bilateral agreements entered into at the sole discretion of the default service provider which shall be at prices which are: (A) no greater than the cost of obtaining generation under comparable terms in the wholesale market, as determined by the commission at the time of execution of the contract; or (B) consistent with a commission-approved competition procurement process. Any agreement between affiliated parties shall be subject to review and approval of the commission under Chapter 21 (relating to relations with affiliated interests). In no case shall the cost of obtaining generation from any affiliated interest be greater than the cost of obtaining generation under comparable terms in the wholesale market at the time of execution of the contract. (3.2) The electric power procured pursuant to paragraph (3.1) shall include a prudent mix of the following: (i) Spot market purchases. (ii) Short-term contracts. (iii) Long-term purchase contracts, entered into as a result of an auction, request for proposal or bilateral contract that is free of undue influence, duress or favoritism, of more than four and not more than 20 years. The default service provider shall have sole discretion to determine the source and fuel type. Long-term purchase contracts under this subparagraph may not constitute more than 25% of the default service provider's projected default service load unless the commission, after a hearing, determines for good cause that a greater portion of load is necessary to achieve least cost procurement. This subparagraph shall not apply to contracts executed under paragraph (5). (3.3) The commission may determine that a contract is required to be extended for a longer term of up to 20 years, if the extension is necessary to ensure adequate and reliable service at least cost to customers over time. (3.4) The prudent mix of contracts entered into pursuant to paragraphs (3.2) and (3.3) shall be designed to ensure: (i) Adequate and reliable service. (ii) The least cost to customers over time. (iii) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (3.1). (3.5) Except as set forth in paragraph (5)(ii), the provisions of this section shall apply to any type of energy purchased by a default service provider to provide electric generation supply service, including energy or alternative energy portfolio standards credits required to be purchased under the act of November 30, 2004 (P.L.1672, No.213), known as the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act. The commission shall apply paragraph (3.4) to comparable types of energy sources. (3.6) The default service provider shall file a plan for competitive procurement with the commission and obtain commission approval of the plan considering the standards in paragraphs (3.1), (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4) before the competitive process is implemented. The commission shall hold hearings as necessary on the proposed plan. If the commission fails to issue a final order on the plan within nine months of the date that the plan is filed, the plan shall be deemed to be approved and the default service provider may implement the plan as filed. Costs incurred through an approved competitive procurement plan shall be deemed to be the least cost over time as required under paragraph (3.4)(ii). (3.7) At the time the commission evaluates the plan and prior to approval, in determining if the default electric service provider's plan obtains generation supply at the least cost, the commission shall consider the default service provider's obligation to provide adequate and reliable service to customers and that the default service provider has obtained a prudent mix of contracts to obtain least cost on a long-term, short-term and spot market basis and shall make specific findings which shall include the following: (i) The default service provider's plan includes prudent steps necessary to negotiate favorable generation supply contracts. (ii) The default service provider's plan includes prudent steps necessary to obtain least cost generation supply contracts on a long-term, short-term and spot market basis. (iii) Neither the default service provider nor its affiliated interest has withheld from the market any generation supply in a manner that violates Federal law. (3.8) Notwithstanding sections 508 (relating to power of the commission to vary, reform and revise contracts) and 2102 (relating to approval of contracts with affiliated interests), the commission may modify contracts or disallow costs only when the party seeking recovery of the costs of a procurement plan is, after hearing, found to be at fault for the following: (i) not complying with the commission-approved procurement plan; or (ii) the commission of fraud, collusion or market manipulation with regard to these contracts. (3.9) The default service provider shall have the right to recover on a full and current basis, pursuant to a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments), all reasonable costs incurred under this section and a commission-approved competitive procurement plan. (4) If a customer that chooses an alternative supplier and subsequently desires to return to the local distribution company for generation service, the local distribution company shall treat that customer exactly as it would any new applicant for energy service. (5) (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (3.1), the electric distribution company or commission-approved alternative supplier may, in its sole discretion, offer large customers with a peak demand of 15 megawatts or greater at one meter at a location in its service territory any negotiated rate for service at all of the customers' locations within the service territory for any duration agreed upon by the electric distribution company or commission-approved alternative supplier and the large customer. The commission shall permit, but shall not require, an electric distribution company or commission-approved alternative supplier to provide service to large customers under this paragraph. Contract rates entered into under this paragraph shall be subject to review by the commission in order to ensure that all costs related to the rates are borne by the parties to the contract and that no costs related to the rates are borne by other customers or customer classes. If no costs related to the rates are borne by other customers or customer classes, the commission shall approve the contract within 90 days of its filing, or it shall be deemed approved by operation of law upon expiration of the 90 days. Information submitted under this paragraph shall be subject to the commission's procedures for the filing of confidential and proprietary information. (ii) For purposes of providing service under this paragraph to customers with a peak demand of 20 megawatts or greater at one meter at a location within that distribution company's service territory, an electric distribution company that has completed its restructuring transition period as of the effective date of this paragraph may, in its sole discretion, acquire an interest in a generation facility or construct a generation facility specifically to meet the energy requirements of the customers, including the electric requirements of the customers' other billing locations within its service territory. The electric distribution company must commence construction of the generation facility or contract to acquire the generation interest within three years after the effective date of this paragraph, except that the electric distribution company may add to the generation facilities it commenced construction or contracted to acquire after this three-year period to serve additional load of customers for whom it commenced construction or contracted to acquire generation within three years. Nothing in this paragraph requires or authorizes the commission to require an electric distribution company to commence construction or acquire an interest in a generation facility. The electric distribution company's interest in the generation facility it built or contracted to acquire shall be no larger than necessary to meet peak demand of customers served under this subparagraph. During times when the customer's demand is less than the electric distribution company's generation interest, the electric distribution company may sell excess power on the wholesale market. At no time shall the costs associated with the generating facility interests be included in rate base or otherwise reflected in rates. The generation facility interests shall not be commission-regulated assets. (6) A default service plan approved by the commission prior to the effective date of this section shall remain in effect through its approved term. At its sole discretion, the default service provider may propose amendments to its approved plan that are consistent with this section, and the commission shall issue a decision whether to approve or disapprove the proposed amendments within nine months of the date that the amendments are filed. If the commission fails to issue a final order within nine months, the amendments shall be deemed to be approved and the default service provider may implement the amendments as filed. (7) The default service provider shall offer residential and small business customers a generation supply service rate that shall change no more frequently than on a quarterly basis. All default service rates shall be reviewed by the commission to ensure that the costs of providing service to each customer class are not subsidized by any other class. (f) Smart meter technology and time of use rates.-- (1) Within nine months after the effective date of this paragraph, electric distribution companies shall file a smart meter technology procurement and installation plan with the commission for approval. The plan shall describe the smart meter technologies the electric distribution company proposes to install in accordance with paragraph (2). (2) Electric distribution companies shall furnish smart meter technology as follows: (i) Upon request from a customer that agrees to pay the cost of the smart meter at the time of the request. (ii) In new building construction. (iii) In accordance with a depreciation schedule not to exceed 15 years. (3) Electric distribution companies shall, with customer consent, make available direct meter access and electronic access to customer meter data to third parties, including electric generation suppliers and providers of conservation and load management services. (4) In no event shall lost or decreased revenues by an electric distribution company due to reduced electricity consumption or shifting energy demand be considered any of the following: (i) A cost of smart meter technology recoverable under a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307(b), except that decreased revenues and reduced energy consumption may be reflected in the revenue and sales data used to calculate rates in a distribution rate base rate proceeding filed under section 1308 (relating to voluntary changes in rates). (ii) A recoverable cost. (5) By January 1, 2010, or at the end of the applicable generation rate cap period, whichever is later, a default service provider shall submit to the commission one or more proposed time-of-use rates and real-time price plans. The commission shall approve or modify the time-of-use rates and real-time price plan within six months of submittal. The default service provider shall offer the time-of-use rates and real-time price plan to all customers that have been provided with smart meter technology under paragraph (2)(iii). Residential or commercial customers may elect to participate in time-of-use rates or real-time pricing. The default service provider shall submit an annual report to the price programs and the efficacy of the programs in affecting energy demand and consumption and the effect on wholesale market prices. (6) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to an electric distribution company with 100,000 or fewer customers. (7) An electric distribution company may recover reasonable and prudent costs of providing smart meter technology under paragraph (2)(ii) and (iii), as determined by the commission. This paragraph includes annual depreciation and capital costs over the life of the smart meter technology and the cost of any system upgrades that the electric distribution company may require to enable the use of the smart meter technology which are incurred after the effective date of this paragraph, less operating and capital cost savings realized by the electric distribution company from the installation and use of the smart meter technology. Smart meter technology shall be deemed to be a new service offered for the first time under section 2804(4)(vi). An electric distribution company may recover smart meter technology costs: (i) through base rates, including a deferral for future base rate recovery of current basis with carrying charge as determined by the commission; or (ii) on a full and current basis through a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"smart meter technology\" means technology, including metering technology and network communications technology capable of bidirectional communication, that records electricity usage on at least an hourly basis, including related electric distribution system upgrades to enable the technology. The technology shall provide customers with direct access to and use of price and consumption information. The technology shall also: (1) Directly provide customers with information on their hourly consumption. (2) Enable time-of-use rates and real-time price programs. (3) Effectively support the automatic control of the customer's electricity consumption by one or more of the following as selected by the customer: (i) the customer; (ii) the customer's utility; or (iii) a third party engaged by the customer or the customer's utility.

      "text": "§ 2808. Competitive transition charge. (a) General rule.-- To provide each electric utility with an opportunity to recover its transition or stranded costs following the commission's determination under subsection (c), every customer accessing the transmission or distribution network shall pay a competitive transition charge to the electric distribution company in whose certificated territory that customer is located. The costs to be recovered shall be allocated to customer classes in a manner that does not shift interclass or intraclass costs and maintains consistency with the allocation methodology for utility production plant accepted by the commission in the electric utility's most recent base rate proceeding. If a customer installs on-site generation which operates in parallel with other generation on the public utility's system and which significantly reduces the customer's purchases of electricity through the transmission and distribution network, the customer's fully allocated share of transition or stranded costs shall be recovered from the customer through a competitive transition charge. The recovery of transition or stranded costs associated with existing generating facilities is contingent on continued operation at reasonable availability levels of the generation facilities for which recovery has been approved, except when the generation facility is uneconomic on a production cost basis because of the transition to a competitive market. (b) Period for collecting competitive transition charge.-- The competitive transition charge shall be included on bills to customers for a period not to exceed nine years from the effective date of this chapter unless an alternative payment methodology is mutually agreed upon by the customer and the utility or unless the commission in its discretion and for good cause shown orders an alternative payment period. In establishing the length of the period for collection of the competitive transition charge, the commission shall consider the effect on the ability of the Commonwealth to compete in attracting industry and jobs, on the financial health of electric utilities and other relevant factors. (c) Determination of competitive transition charge.-- In determining the level of transition or stranded costs that an electric utility may recover through the competitive transition charge, the commission shall apply the following principles: (1) The commission shall allow recovery of regulatory assets and other deferred charges typically recoverable under current regulatory practice, the unfunded portion of the utility's projected nuclear generating plant decommissioning costs and cost obligations under contracts with nonutility generating projects that have received a commission order. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring an electric utility or a nonutility generating project to enter into an arrangement to buy down, buy out and terminate or otherwise restructure a contract or as authorizing the commission to require a utility to pursue such an arrangement with a nonutility generating project. (2) The commission shall allow recovery of an electric utility's prudently incurred costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation of nonutility generating projects consistent with section 527 (relating to cogeneration rules and regulations). (3) The commission shall determine the level of other generation-related transition or stranded costs that may be recovered through the competitive transition charge. (4) The commission shall consider the extent to which the electric utility has undertaken efforts to mitigate generation-related transition or stranded costs by appropriate means in a manner that is reasonable under all of the circumstances, including consideration of whether mitigation has been commensurate with the magnitude of the electric utility's generation-related transition or stranded costs. During the transition period, electric utilities shall have the duty to mitigate generation-related transition or stranded costs to the extent practicable. Efforts may include the following: (i) Acceleration of depreciation and amortization of existing rate base generation assets. (ii) Minimization of new capital spending for existing rate base generation assets. (iii) Reallocation of depreciation reserves to existing rate base generation assets. (iv) Reduction of book assets by application of new proceeds of any sale of idle or underutilized existing rate base generation assets. (v) Maximization of market revenues from existing rate base generation assets. (vi) Issuance of securitized debt pursuant to the provisions of section 2812 (relating to approval of transition bonds). (5) Of equal importance to the mitigation efforts under paragraph (4), the commission shall consider efforts undertaken over time, prior to the enactment of this chapter, to reduce or moderate customer rate levels while maintaining safe and efficient operations. (d) Commission review.-- As a component of its restructuring plan, each electric utility shall file with the commission a recovery plan, including a proposed competitive transition charge and supporting documentation. In evaluating a recovery plan and any proposed competitive transition charge, the commission shall schedule open evidentiary hearings with proper notice and opportunity for all parties to cross-examine witnesses as necessary. (e) Use of transition bonds.-- After the effective date of this chapter, a utility may apply to the commission for a qualified rate order under section 2812 for some or all of its transition or stranded costs. (1) In evaluating a utility application under this subsection, the commission shall schedule hearings, as necessary. (2) If the commission issues a qualified rate order under section 2812 and if the transition bonds approved by that order are successfully issued, then: (i) the utility shall impose and collect through its customer bills the intangible transition charges approved by that qualified rate order; and (ii) simultaneously, either the utility's rates for electric service or the utility's competitive transition charges shall be reduced by an amount equal to the revenue requirement of the transition or stranded costs for which transition bonds have been successfully issued. (f) Annual revenue.-- Consistent with section 1307(e) (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments), the commission shall establish procedures for the annual review of the competitive transition charge. The review shall reconcile the annual revenues received from the charge with the annual amortization of transition or stranded costs approved by the commission under this section. The commission shall adjust the competitive transition charge based upon underrecovery or overrecovery of the annual amortization amount. Cross References.

(a) License requirement.-- No person or corporation, including municipal corporations which choose to provide service outside their municipal limits except to the extent provided prior to the effective date of this chapter, brokers and marketers, aggregators and other entities, shall engage in the business of an electric generation supplier in this Commonwealth unless the person or corporation holds a license issued by the commission. Consistent with 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 (relating to generation choice for customers of electric cooperatives), electric cooperative corporations must possess a certificate for service to supply generation services beyond their territorial limits. (b) License application and issuance.-- An application for an electric generation supplier license must be made to the commission in writing, be verified by oath or affirmation and be in such form and contain such information as the commission may by its regulations require. A license shall be issued to any qualified applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the service covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing and able to perform properly the service proposed and to conform to the provisions of this title and the lawful orders and regulations of the commission under this title, including the commission's regulations regarding standards and billing practices, and that the proposed service, to the extent authorized by the license, will be consistent with the public interest and the policy declared in this chapter; otherwise, such application shall be denied. (c) Financial responsibility.-- (1) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the generation of electricity in this Commonwealth, no energy supplier license shall be issued or remain in force unless the holder complies with all of the following: (i) Furnishes a bond or other security approved by the commission in form and amount to ensure the financial responsibility of the electric generation supplier and the supply of electricity at retail in accordance with contracts, agreements or arrangements. (ii) Certifies to the commission that it will pay and in subsequent years has paid the full amount of taxes imposed by Articles II and XI of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971, and any tax imposed by this chapter. (iii) Provides the commission with the address of the participant's principal office in this Commonwealth or the address of the participant's registered agent in this Commonwealth, the latter being the address at which the participant may be served process. (iv) Agrees that it shall be subject to all taxes imposed by the Tax Reform Code of 1971 and any tax imposed by this chapter. Failure of an electricity supplier to pay a tax referred to in this paragraph or to otherwise comply with the provisions of this paragraph shall be cause for the commission to revoke the license of the electricity supplier. (2) If an electricity supplier other than an electric distribution company does not pay the tax imposed upon gross receipts under section 1101 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 or this chapter, the electric distribution company to whose retail customer the electricity supplier provided generation service shall remit the unpaid tax, as a tax on the use of electricity in this Commonwealth, to the Department of Revenue and may collect or seek reimbursement of the tax so paid from the electricity provider or any other appropriate party that used the electricity in this Commonwealth. The department shall collect and enforce the use tax herein provided under section 1102 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. Failure of the electric distribution company to pay the amount within 30 days after notice provided by the department shall cause interest to be imposed on the electric distribution company in accordance with Article XI of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. Interest shall be calculated from the 31st day after the department gives the notice required in this paragraph. An electric distribution company or other appropriate person may challenge the imposition of the tax and interest by filing a petition with the department not later than 30 days after the date on which the tax became due. (d) Transferability of licenses.-- No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without prior commission approval. (e) Form of regulation of electric generation suppliers.-- The commission may forbear from applying requirements of this part which it determines are unnecessary due to competition among electric generation suppliers. In regulating the service of electric generation suppliers, the commission shall impose requirements necessary to ensure that the present quality of service provided by electric utilities does not deteriorate, including assuring that adequate reserve margins of electric supply are maintained and assuring that 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service) are maintained. (f) Availability of the services of brokers and marketers or aggregators.-- Prior to approving the licensure of any broker and marketer or aggregator, the commission shall set forth standards to ensure that all retail customer classes may choose to purchase electricity through a broker and marketer or aggregator. The commission shall also ensure that brokers, marketers and aggregators comply with 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56. (g) Annual fees.-- The commission may establish, by order or rule, on a reasonable cost basis, fees to be charged for annual activities related to the oversight of electric generation suppliers.

      "text": "§ 2810. Revenue-neutral reconciliation. (a) General intent of revenue-neutral reconciliation.-- It is the intention of the General Assembly that the restructuring of the electric industry be accomplished in a manner that allows Pennsylvania to enjoy the benefits of competition, promotes the competitiveness of Pennsylvania's electric utilities and maintains revenue neutrality to the Commonwealth. This section is not intended to cause a shift in proportional tax obligations among customer classes or individual electric distribution companies. It is the intention of the General Assembly to establish this revenue replacement at a level necessary to recoup losses that may result from the restructuring of the electric industry and the transition thereto. (b) Imposition.-- (1) For tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 1999, a tax at the rate provided in subsection (c) is imposed upon the gross receipts of electric distribution companies and electric generation suppliers. (2) A tax at the rate provided in subsection (c) is imposed upon the gross receipts of any municipality owned or operated public utility or of any public utility service furnished by any municipality. Gross receipts shall be exempt from the tax to the extent that gross receipts are derived from sales of electric energy inside the limits of the municipality owning or operating the public utility or furnishing the public utility service. (3) A tax at the rate provided in subsection (c) is imposed upon the gross receipts derived from any electric cooperative owned or operated public utility or from any public utility service furnished by any electric cooperative. Gross receipts shall be exempt from the tax to the extent that gross receipts are derived from sales for resale or sales of electric energy within the limits of its service territory as set forth in 15 Pa.C.S. § 7406 (relating to competition by electric cooperatives). (c) Rate.-- (1) By December 1, 1998, and each October 1 thereafter until and including October 1, 2002, the Secretary of Revenue shall publish the rate of tax as provided in paragraph (2) in the form of a notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and the rate shall apply to the tax imposed by subsection (b) for the period beginning the next January 1. The tax rate published on October 1, 2002, shall continue in force without further adjustment. If the commission determines under section 2806(c) (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates) to extend the transition period by more than six months, the requirement for an annual adjustment of the tax rate shall be extended by one additional year. The secretary shall also certify the rate calculated to the majority and minority chairs of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate and the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives and detail the calculations of the rate. (2) The secretary shall calculate the rate for the periods beginning on and after January 1, 1999, in the manner set forth in this paragraph: (i) Multiply the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total kilowatt hours of electricity distributed for ultimate consumption in Pennsylvania in the preceding calendar year as certified by the commission and the denominator of which is the total kilowatt hours of electricity distributed for ultimate consumption in Pennsylvania in the calendar year 1995 as certified by the commission. (ii) From the product derived under subparagraph (i), subtract the total cash payments made to the department during the Commonwealth's preceding fiscal year on account of affected taxes actually paid by each electric distribution company and electric generation supplier and by any other entity, including a successor, whose affected taxes are contained in the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base. (iii) Divide the difference derived under subparagraph (ii) by the total gross receipts in the preceding calendar year as certified by the commission to determine the tax rate. The tax rate under this subparagraph shall be a decimal rounded to three places. (3) On August 1, 2000, August 1, 2001, and August 1, 2002, the department shall deliver a report to the General Assembly and the Governor that shall describe the dynamic economic effect upon the affected taxes due to electric utility restructuring. It is the purpose of this report to provide the General Assembly and the Governor with information to determine whether it is appropriate to consider modifying the calculation described in paragraph (2) to reflect additional tax revenues, if any, resulting from the dynamic economic effects upon the affected taxes. (4) If the effective rate for any affected tax is different from the effective rate for such affected tax in the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base, an adjustment shall be made to the computation of the rate of tax under paragraph (2) by multiplying that portion of the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base attributable to the affected tax by a fraction, the numerator of which is the effective rate of the affected tax for the preceding fiscal year and the denominator of which is the effective rate of tax of the affected tax in the base fiscal year. (5) For negative rates: (i) If the rate of tax calculated for a tax year prior to the tax year beginning January 1, 2004, or January 1, 2005, in the event of an extension by more than six months by the commission as provided in section 2806(c) is negative, a credit equal to the negative tax rate for such tax year multiplied by the taxable gross receipts for that tax year shall be allowed against the taxpayer's liability for any tax for that tax year imposed under Article XI of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971. (ii) If the rate of tax calculated as the final adjustment is negative for the tax period beginning January 1, 2003, or January 1, 2004, in the event of an extension by more than six months by the commission as provided in section 2806(c), the rate of tax imposed by section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 for the tax years beginning January 1, 2004, and thereafter, or January 1, 2005, and thereafter, in the event of an extension by more than six months, shall be adjusted and set as follows: the tax rate expressed as a decimal rounded to three positions shall be subtracted from .044 or the current rate imposed under section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 to determine the adjusted tax rate. The adjusted tax rate shall be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. (6) Information to be provided to the department or the commission shall be as follows: (i) To ensure the identification of cash payments for purposes of subsection (d), the commission shall require any licensee, electric distribution company, electric generation supplier or other person affected to disclose on its license application, renewal or transfer its State tax account or similar number relative to any of the taxes specified. (ii) The commission shall report and certify to the secretary of the department by August 1, 1998, and each August 1 thereafter the total amount of electricity distributed for ultimate consumption in this Commonwealth during the previous two calendar years and the total gross receipts for the past year. (iii) As a condition of licensure, the commission shall require each electric distribution company and electric generation supplier to report their annual gross receipts in this Commonwealth. (iv) For purposes of enforcing sections 2806 and 2809 (relating to requirements for electric generation suppliers) as they relate to the payment of State taxes, an applicant for the grant, renewal or transfer of a license issued under this title shall, by filing an application with the commission, waive confidentiality with respect to State tax information regarding the applicant in the possession of the department, regardless of the source of the information, and shall consent to the department providing that information to the commission. (7) (Repealed). (d) Payment of tax and reports.-- The tax imposed under subsection (b) shall be paid within the time prescribed by law. For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the tax, the treasurer or other appropriate officer of the taxpayer shall transmit to the department by March 15 an annual report, and under oath or affirmation, of the amount of gross receipts received by the taxpayer during the prior calendar year. The treasurer or other appropriate officer of the taxpayer liable to report or pay taxes imposed under subsection (b), except municipalities and cooperatives, shall transmit to the department by March 15 a tentative report for the prior calendar year. The tentative report shall set forth all of the following: (i) The amount of gross receipts received in the period of 12 months next preceding and reported in the annual report. (ii) The gross receipts received in the first three months of the current calendar year. (iii) Other information as the department may require. (e) Tax computation.-- Upon the date its tentative report is required to be made, the taxpayer making a tentative report shall transmit the report to the department on account of the tax due for the current calendar year and compute and make payment of the tentative tax with the report under section 3003 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. (f) Time to file reports.-- The time for filing annual reports may be extended, estimated settlements may be made by the department if reports are not filed, and the penalties for failing to file reports and pay the taxes imposed under subsection (b) shall be as prescribed by the laws defining the powers and duties of the department. If the works of a taxpayer are operated by another taxpayer, the taxes imposed under subsection (b) shall be apportioned between the taxpayers in accordance with the terms of their respective leases or agreements. For the payment of the apportioned taxes, the Commonwealth shall first look to the taxpayer operating the works. Upon payment by that taxpayer, no other taxpayer shall be held liable for any tax imposed under subsection (b). (g) Timely mailing treated as timely filing and payment.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of any State tax law to the contrary, whenever payment of all or any portion of a State tax is required by law to be received by the department or other agency of the Commonwealth by a day certain, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have complied with that law if the letter transmitting payment of the tax which has been received by the department is postmarked by the United States Postal Service on or prior to the final day on which the payment is to be received. (h) Procedure, enforcement and penalties.-- Parts III, IV, VI and VII of Article IV and Article XXX of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 shall apply to this section insofar as they are consistent with this section and applicable to the tax imposed under subsection (b). Notwithstanding the provisions of section 403(d) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, if the officers of any corporation subject to tax under this chapter neglect or refuse to make a report as required in this chapter or knowingly make a false report, the department shall add to the tax determined to be due a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due for each month or fraction of a month until the penalty has reached 25% and thereafter a penalty of 1% of the amount of tax due for each month or fraction of a month. Penalties added to the tax shall not bear interest. (i) Electric light, waterpower and hydroelectric utilities.-- The terms \"electric light company,\" \"waterpower company\" and \"hydro-electric company,\" as used in section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, shall be deemed to include electric distribution companies and electric generation suppliers. (j) Sales of electric energy.-- Retail sales of electric generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electric energy, dispatching services, customer services, competitive transition charges, intangible transition charges and universal service and energy conservation charges and such other retail sales in this Commonwealth the receipts of which, if bundled, would have been deemed to be sales of electric energy prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be deemed sales of electric energy for purposes of section 1101 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. The phrases \"doing business in this Commonwealth\" and \"engaged in electric light and power business, waterpower business and hydro-electric business in this Commonwealth,\" as such terms are used in section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 and in this chapter, shall be construed to include the direct or indirect engaging in, transacting or conducting of activity in this Commonwealth for the purpose of establishing or maintaining a market for the sales of electric energy and include obtaining a license or certification from the commission to supply electric energy. Retail sales of generation shall be deemed to occur at the meter of the retail consumer. (k) Electric cooperatives.-- Section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 shall apply to electric cooperatives and impose a tax upon the gross receipts derived from any electric cooperative owned or operated public utility or from any public utility service furnished by any electric cooperative. Gross receipts shall be exempt from the tax to the extent that the gross receipts are derived from sales for resale or sales of electric energy within the limits of its service territory as set forth in 15 Pa.C.S. § 7406.

      "text": "§ 2812. Approval of transition bonds. (a) Qualified rate orders.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission is authorized to issue qualified rate orders in accordance with the provisions of this subsection to facilitate the recovery or financing of qualified transition expenses of an electric utility or assignee. (1) A qualified rate order may be adopted by the commission only upon the application of an electric utility and shall become effective in accordance with its terms. After the issuance of a qualified rate order, the electric utility retains sole discretion regarding whether to assign, sell or otherwise transfer intangible transition property or to cause the transition bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such assignment, sale, transfer or issuance. (2) After the effective date of this chapter, an electric utility may file an application for a qualified rate order pursuant to the following procedures: (i) Each application for a qualified rate order shall contain a complete accounting of the utility's transition or stranded costs, detailed information regarding the utility's proposal for the sale of intangible transition property or the issuance of transition bonds and information regarding the electric utility's planned use of the proceeds of the sale or issuance. After the utility has filed its restructuring plan under section 2806 (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates), the utility may incorporate by reference the information in the restructuring plan in providing the information. (ii) An electric utility may file an application for a qualified rate order concurrently with, prior to, during or following the filing of its restructuring plan under section 2806. If an electric utility requests expedited review under subsection (b)(1)(i) or (ii), it shall designate in its application the portion of its total claimed transition or stranded costs for which it requests such expedited review. (iii) After notice and an opportunity to be heard, the commission may issue a final qualified rate order for all or a portion of the amount of transition or stranded costs that it finds would be just and reasonable for the utility to recover from ratepayers under sections 2804 (relating to standards for restructuring of electric industry) and 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge). The commission shall issue a final qualified rate order only for the amounts for which it finds such issuance to be in the public interest. The commission shall complete its review of the application and issue its final determination by the later of nine months from the filing, unless the electric utility requests expedited treatment under subsection (b), or 15 days following the filing of the electric utility's restructuring plan under section 2806. (b) Expedited review procedures.-- (1) The commission shall provide for expedited review of applications for qualified rate orders upon request of the electric utility pursuant to the following procedures: (i) If the utility elects to file an application prior to the filing of its restructuring plan and requests expedited review, the commission, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, may issue a final qualified rate order approving the issuance of transition bonds for a portion of the utility's transition or stranded costs that the commission finds would be just and reasonable to recover from ratepayers under sections 2804 and 2808. The commission shall consider only the portion of the transition or stranded costs for which the utility requests approval to issue transition bonds. Consideration of all remaining amounts and amounts not resolved by the commission shall be deferred for consideration in the electric utility's restructuring plan proceeding under section 2806. The commission shall complete its review of the application and issue its final determination within 120 days after the request for expedited review but in no event earlier than 15 days after the utility has filed its restructuring plan under section 2806. (ii) If the electric utility files an application for a qualified rate order concurrently with its restructuring plan or during the course of the restructuring plan proceeding, the electric utility may request, and the commission may allow, an accelerated determination of the application. After notice and an opportunity to be heard, the commission may issue a final qualified rate order approving the issuance of transition bonds for a portion of the utility's stranded or transition costs that the commission finds would be just and reasonable to recover from ratepayers under sections 2804 and 2808. The commission shall consider only the portion of the utility's transition or stranded costs for which the utility seeks expedited review. Consideration of all remaining amounts and amounts not resolved by the commission shall be deferred for consideration in a final order regarding the utility's restructuring plan under section 2806. The commission shall complete its review of the application and issue its final determination within 120 days after the request for expedited review. (iii) If the electric utility files an application for a qualified rate order after the commission enters a final order regarding the utility's restructuring plan, and requests expedited treatment, the commission shall complete its review and issue its final determination within 120 days of the request for expedited review. (2) The qualified rate order shall require that the proceeds from the assignment, sale or transfer or other financing of intangible transition property shall be used principally to reduce the electric utility's transition or stranded costs and to reduce the related capitalization, pursuant to a plan submitted by the electric utility in its application for a qualified rate order and approved by the commission. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission has the power to specify that all or a portion of a qualified rate order shall be irrevocable. To the extent so specified, neither the order nor the intangible transition charges authorized to be imposed and collected under the order shall be subject to reduction, postponement, impairment or termination by any subsequent action of the commission. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to supersede the right of any party to judicial review of the qualified rate order. (4) The commission shall provide in any qualified rate order for a procedure for the expeditious approval by the commission of periodic adjustments to the intangible transition charges that are the subject of the pertinent qualified rate order. Such adjustments shall ensure the recovery of revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of principal, interest, acquisition or redemption premium and for other fees, costs and charges in respect of transition bonds approved by the commission as part of or in conjunction with a qualified rate order. The commission shall determine whether the adjustments are required on each anniversary of the issuance of the qualified rate order and at the additional intervals as may be provided for in the qualified rate order. The adjustments, if required, shall be approved within 90 days of each anniversary of the issuance of the qualified rate order or of each additional interval provided for in the qualified rate order. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on such conditions as the commission may approve, all or portions of the interest of an electric utility in intangible transition property may be assigned, sold or transferred to an assignee and may be pledged or assigned as security by an electric utility or assignee to or for the benefit of a financing party. To the extent that an interest is assigned, sold or transferred or is pledged or assigned as security, the commission shall authorize the electric utility to contract with the assignee or financing party that the electric utility will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will impose and collect the applicable intangible transition charges for the benefit and account of the assignee or financing party and will account for and remit the applicable intangible transition charge to or for the account of the assignee or financing party. If the qualified rate order so provides, the obligations of the electric utility: (i) shall be binding upon the electric utility, its successors and assigns; and (ii) shall be required by the commission to be undertaken and performed by the electric utility and any other entity which provides electric service to a person that was a customer of an electric utility located within the certificated territory of the electric utility on the effective date of this chapter or that became a customer of electric services within such territory after the effective date of this chapter and is still located within such territory, as a condition to the provision of service to such customer by such electric utility or other entity, unless the customer has paid a termination charge in the manner and on the basis specified in the qualified rate order. (6) The irrevocable status of any portion of a qualified rate order under paragraph (3) shall lapse and terminate to the extent that an assignment, sale or transfer of the intangible transition property resulting from the rate order or the issuance of the related transition bonds is not effected within the period specified in the qualified rate order. (7) The effect of any subsequent refinancing of transition bonds upon the rates authorized in a qualified rate order shall be as provided in such order. (8) In its qualified rate order, the commission shall afford flexibility in establishing the terms and conditions of the transition bonds, including repayment schedules, interest rates and other financing costs. The electric utility shall file the final terms of issuance with the commission. (c) Intangible transition property.-- (1) Any right that an electric utility has in the intangible transition property prior to its sale or transfer or any other right created under this section or created in the qualified rate order and assignable under this section or assignable pursuant to a qualified rate order shall be only a contract right. (2) The Commonwealth pledges to and agrees with the holders of any transition bonds issued under this section and with any assignee or financing party who may enter into contracts with an electric utility under this section that the Commonwealth will not limit or alter or in any way impair or reduce the value of intangible transition property or intangible transition charges approved by a qualified rate order until the transition bonds and interest on the transition bonds are fully paid and discharged or the contracts are fully performed on the part of the electric utility. Subject to other requirements of law, nothing in this paragraph shall preclude limitation or alteration if adequate compensation is made by law for the full protection of the intangible transition charges collected pursuant to a qualified rate order and of the holder of this transition bond and any assignee or financing party entering into contract with the electric utility. (d) Security interests in intangible transition property.-- (1) Neither intangible transition property nor any right, title or interest of a utility or assignee described in paragraph (1) of the definition of \"intangible transition property\" in subsection (g), whether before or after the issuance of the qualified rate order, shall constitute \"an account\" or \"general intangibles\" under 13 Pa.C.S. § 9102 (relating to definitions and index of definitions) nor shall any such right, title or interest pertaining to a qualified rate order, including the associated intangible transition property and any revenues, collections, claims, payments, money or proceeds of or arising from intangible transition charges pursuant to such order, be deemed proceeds of any right or interest other than in the order and the intangible transition property arising from the order. (2) The granting, perfection and enforcement of security interests in intangible transition property to secure transition bonds is governed by this section rather than by Title 13 (relating to commercial code). (3) A valid and enforceable security interest in intangible transition property shall attach and be perfected only by means of a separate filing with the commission, under regulations the commission prescribes. For this purpose: (i) If the transition bonds are issued to finance any qualified transition expenses, as specified in the applicable qualified rate order, the lien of the bonds shall attach automatically to the intangible transition property relating to the expenses from the time of issuance of the bonds. (ii) The lien under subparagraph (i) shall be deemed a valid and enforceable security interest in the intangible transition property securing the qualified transition bonds and shall be continuously perfected if, before the date of issuance specified in subparagraph (i) or within no more than ten days after the date, a filing has been made by or on behalf of the financing party to protect that security interest in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the commission under this subsection. Any filing in respect to such transition bonds shall take precedence over any other filing. (iii) The lien under subparagraph (i) is enforceable against the assignee and all third parties, including judicial lien creditors, subject only to the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the intangible transition property previously perfected in the manner described in this subsection if value has been given by the purchasers of transition bonds. A perfected lien in intangible transition property is a continuously perfected security interest in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect to the associated intangible transition property, whether or not revenues have accrued. Intangible transition property constitutes property for the purposes of contracts securing transition bonds, whether or not the related revenues have accrued. The lien created under this paragraph is perfected and ranks prior to any other lien, including any judicial lien, which subsequently attaches to the intangible transition property, to the intangible transition charges and to the qualified rate order and any rights created by the order or any proceeds of the order. The relative priority of a lien created under this paragraph is not defeated or adversely affected by changes to the qualified rate order or to the intangible transition charges payable by any customer. (iv) The relative priority of a lien created under this paragraph is not defeated or adversely affected by the commingling of revenues arising with respect to intangible transition property with funds of the electric utility or other funds of the assignee. (v) If an event of default occurs under approved transition bonds, the holders of transition bonds or their authorized representatives, as secured parties, may foreclose or otherwise enforce the lien in the intangible transition property securing the transition bonds, subject to the rights of any third parties holding prior security interests in the intangible transition property perfected in the manner provided in this subsection. Upon application by the holders or their representatives, without limiting their other remedies, the commission shall order the sequestration and payment to the holders or their representatives of revenues arising with respect to the intangible transition property pledged to the holders. An order under this subparagraph shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electric utility or assignee. (4) The commission shall establish and maintain a separate system of records to reflect the date and time of receipt of all filings made under this subsection and may provide that transfers of intangible transition property to an assignee be filed in accordance with the same system. (e) True sale.-- A transfer of intangible transition property by an electric utility to an assignee which the parties have in the governing documentation expressly stated to be a sale or other absolute transfer, in a transaction approved in a qualified rate order, shall be treated as an absolute transfer of all of the transferor's right, title and interest, as in a true sale, and not as a pledge or other financing, of the intangible transition property, other than for Federal and State income and franchise tax purposes. Granting to holders of transition bonds a preferred right to the intangible transition property or the provision by the electric utility of any credit enhancement with respect to transition bonds shall not impair or negate the characterization of any transfer as a true sale, other than for Federal and State income and franchise tax purposes. A transfer of intangible transition property shall be deemed perfected as against third persons, including any judicial lien creditors, when all of the following have taken place: (1) The commission has issued the qualified rate order creating intangible transition property. (2) A sale or transfer of the intangible transition property in writing has been executed and delivered to the assignee. (f) Actions with respect to intangible transition charges.-- (1) Nothing in this chapter shall entitle any person to bring an action against a retail electric customer for nonpayment of intangible transition charges, other than the electric utility, its successor or any other entity which provides electric service to a person that was a customer of an electric utility located within the certificated territory of the electric utility on the effective date of this chapter or that became a customer of electric services within such territory after the effective date of this chapter and is still located within such territory. (2) The commission has exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of the obligations to impose and collect intangible transition charges of an electric utility, its successor or any other entity which provides electric service to a person that was a customer of an electric utility located within the certificated territory of the electric utility on the effective date of this chapter or that became a customer of electric services within such territory after the effective date of this chapter and is still located within such territory. (g) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Assignee.\" An entity, including a corporation, public authority, trust or financing vehicle, to which an electric utility assigns, sells or transfers other than as security all or a portion of its interest in or right to intangible transition property. The term includes an entity, including a corporation, public authority, trust or financing vehicle to which a direct assignee of an electric utility may assign, sell or transfer other than as security its interest in or right to intangible transition property. \"Financing party.\" A holder of transition bonds, including trustees, collateral agents and other entities acting for the benefit of such a holder. \"Intangible transition charges.\" The amounts authorized to be imposed on all customer bills and collected, through a nonbypassable mechanism by the electric utility or its successor or by any other entity which provides electric service to a person that was a customer of an electric utility located within the certificated territory of the electric utility on the effective date of this chapter or that, after this effective date of this chapter, became a customer of electric services within such territory and is still located within such territory, to recover qualified transition expenses pursuant to a qualified rate order. The amounts shall be allocated to customer classes in a manner that does not shift interclass or intraclass costs and maintains consistency with the allocation methodology for utility production plant accepted by the commission in the electric utility's most recent base rate proceeding. \"Intangible transition property.\" (1) The property right created under this section representing the irrevocable right of the electric utility or an assignee to receive through intangible transition charges amounts sufficient to recover all of its qualified transition expenses. The term includes all right, title and interest of the electric utility or assignee in the qualified rate order and in all revenues, collections, claims, payments, money or proceeds of or arising from intangible transition charges pursuant to the order to the extent that, in accordance with this chapter, the order and the rates and other charges authorized under the order are declared to be irrevocable. (2) Intangible transition property shall arise and exist only when, as and to the extent that an electric utility or assignee has qualified transition expenses for which intangible transition charges are authorized in a qualified rate order that has become effective in accordance with subsection (a) and shall thereafter continuously exist to the extent provided in the order. \"Qualified rate order.\" An order of the commission adopted in accordance with this section, authorizing the imposition and collection of intangible transition charges. \"Qualified transition expenses.\" The transition or stranded costs of an electric utility approved by the commission for recovery under sections 2804 (relating to standards for restructuring of electric industry) and 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge) through the issuance of transition bonds; the costs of retiring existing debt or equity capital of the electric utility or its holding company parent, including accrued interest and acquisition or redemption premium, costs of defeasance, and other related fees, costs and charges relating to, through the issuance of transition bonds or the assignment, sale or other transfer of intangible transition property; and the costs incurred to issue, service or refinance the transition bonds, including accrued interest and acquisition or redemption premium, and other related fees, costs and charges, or to assign, sell or otherwise transfer intangible transition property. \"Transition bonds.\" Bonds, debentures, notes, certificates of participation or of beneficial interest or other evidences of indebtedness or ownership which: (1) are issued by or on behalf of the electric utility or assignee pursuant to a qualified rate order; (2) are secured by or payable from intangible transition property; and (3) reach final maturity in no longer than ten years.

(3) Ensure that customers pay only reasonable charges for protected services which shall be available on a nondiscriminatory basis. (4) Ensure that rates for protected services do not subsidize the competitive ventures of telecommunications carriers. (5) Provide diversity in the supply of existing and future telecommunications services and products in telecommunications markets throughout this Commonwealth by ensuring that rates, terms and conditions for protected services are reasonable and do not impede the development of competition. (6) Ensure the efficient delivery of technological advances and new services throughout this Commonwealth in order to improve the quality of life for all Commonwealth residents. (7) Encourage the provision of telecommunications products and services that enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. (8) Promote and encourage the provision of competitive services by a variety of service providers on equal terms throughout all geographic areas of this Commonwealth without jeopardizing the provision of universal telecommunications service at affordable rates. (9) Encourage the competitive supply of any service in any region where there is market demand. (10) Encourage joint ventures between local exchange telecommunications companies and other entities where such joint ventures accelerate, improve or otherwise assist a local exchange telecommunications company in implementing its network modernization plan. (11) Establish a bona fide retail request program to aggregate and make advanced services available in areas where sufficient market demand exists and to supplement existing network modernization plans. (12) Promote and encourage the provision of advanced services and broadband deployment in the service territories of local exchange telecommunications companies without jeopardizing the provision of universal service. (13) Recognize that the regulatory obligations imposed upon the incumbent local exchange telecommunications companies should be reduced to levels more consistent with those imposed upon competing alternative service providers.

(2) To be considered a bona fide retail request, the written request must include: (i) a request that a minimum of 50 retail access lines or 25% of retail access lines within a community, whichever is less, each be provided the same advanced service or comparable advanced services having a bandwidth within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of each other. Notwithstanding the foregoing comparable bandwidth limitation, where a request includes individual customer requests for advanced services having equal to or less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) bandwidth in the downstream direction, all lines in the request shall be counted in meeting the minimum line requirement of this subparagraph; (ii) the name, address, telephone number and signature of each existing retail customer requesting the advanced service, the advanced service being requested and the number of access lines for which the advanced service is being requested; (iii) the name, address and telephone number of a designated contact person where the request is made by or on behalf of more than one person or business; and (iv) a commitment by each customer who signs the request to subscribe to the requested service for one year, subject to the local exchange telecommunications company's identification of the price and terms of the service and the customer's agreement to the price and terms.

(4) When a bona fide retail request has been received that meets the requirements of paragraph (2), the local exchange telecommunications company shall provide the requested advanced service, or other reasonably comparable service having a bandwidth within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of the requested service, to the community as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 365 days of the date the requirements of paragraph (2) have been met or within the period approved by the commission under paragraph (5) or (6) where: (i) the local exchange telecommunications company provides the requested advanced service to other customers in its service territory; (ii) no service is available to the requesting customers from an alternative service provider at or within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of the data speed requested or such service is available at a price that exceeds the then current price offered by the local exchange telecommunications company by more than 50%; (iii) the community is situated within the service territory of the local exchange telecommunications company; and (iv) the local exchange telecommunications company does not have to provide fiber to the customer's premises to furnish the requested advanced service. (5) Where, as a result of property acquisition, including acquiring rights-of-way, or new construction, a local exchange telecommunications company is unable to provide the requested advanced service within the one-year period set forth in paragraph (4), the company may petition the commission for an extension of up to six months, with service upon the customer or customers who made the bona fide retail request and the department if the department submitted the request on behalf of the customer or customers. The commission may delegate its authority to rule on such petitions to a bureau director or other appropriate employee who shall grant the petition for good cause shown. (6) Where the total number of bona fide retail requests received by any local exchange telecommunications company or affiliated companies that meet the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4) exceed 40 requests in any 12-month period or where there are more than 20 such requests that require property acquisition, including acquiring rights-of-way, or new construction in any 12-month period, the local exchange telecommunications company or companies may provide a verified certification to the commission that one or both of the previously stated criteria are met, with service upon the customer or customers who made the additional requests and upon the department if the department submitted any such requests. Upon receipt of the certification, the commission or the commission through its designated staff shall permit the local exchange telecommunications company or companies to extend the time for such deployments for a period of no more than 12 months unless the commission determines an additional time period to be just and reasonable. If a deployment is extended, it shall be counted in determining the maximum number of deployments provided for under this subsection in any 12-month period covering the month to which it is extended. (7) No advanced service requested and deployed by a local exchange telecommunications company under the bona fide retail request program which has a bandwidth of less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) in the downstream direction shall be counted as a credit toward the local exchange telecommunications company's broadband deployment obligation under its network modernization plan amended pursuant to subsection (b)(2) or (3). (8) With regard to requests submitted under this subsection, a retail customer may challenge the action of a local exchange telecommunications company pursuant to section 701 (relating to complaints).

(d) Business attraction or retention program.-- (1) Not later than 90 days after amending its network modernization plan under subsection (b)(2) or (3), the local exchange telecommunications company shall establish a business attraction or retention program to permit the department to aggregate customer demand where necessary and facilitate the deployment of advanced or broadband services to qualifying businesses which the department seeks to attract to or retain in this Commonwealth and whose requests for such services are submitted by or through the department. (2) Each local exchange telecommunications company which amends its network modernization plan under subsection (b)(2) or (3) not later than 90 days after the effective date of its amended plan shall designate a single point of contact to receive all written advanced or broadband service requests forwarded by the department, provide associated contact information to the department and provide the department and the commission with a written description of its participation in the program and a sample request for advanced or broadband services form for use in the program.

Other requests shall be allocated 50% of the number of such deployments, provided, however, that any allocated deployments that are unused may be utilized by the department or nondepartment applicants, as applicable. (6) For qualifying business or businesses whose request for advanced services is determined by the local exchange telecommunications company to be better processed outside of the bona fide retail request program, the local exchange telecommunications company shall make a proposal to the requesting business or businesses to provide the requested advanced or broadband service and subsequently shall provision such service. The local exchange telecommunications company shall advise the department and the business or businesses within 30 days of the date the contract is signed of the date by which the requested advanced or broadband service will be provided, which date shall be not later than one year after the date the contract is signed unless the business or businesses agree to a longer period or the local exchange telecommunications company obtains commission approval of an extension under the same procedure set forth in subsection (c)(5). (7) No advanced service requested of and deployed by a local exchange telecommunications company under the Business Attraction or Retention Program which has a bandwidth of less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) in the downstream direction shall be counted as a credit toward the local exchange telecommunication company's broadband deployment obligation under its network modernization plan amended under subsection (b)(2) or (3). (8) Each local exchange telecommunications company which is required to participate in the department's Business Attraction or Retention Program shall continue its participation through December 31, 2015, or such earlier date as it achieves 100% broadband availability throughout its service territory.

(3) Each applicant school entity shall be required to provide 100% matching funds to support each E-Fund grant request. Funds received from Federal technology programs such as the universal service support mechanism for schools and libraries set forth in 47 CFR Pt. 54 (relating to universal service or successor regulations), in-kind contributions and any other technology expenditures shall be applied toward the matching fund requirement. (4) No later than 90 days after the effective date of this section, the Department of Education shall prescribe the grant process and the form and manner of the E-Fund application. Grants shall be limited to the funds available in the Education Technology Fund. In awarding grants, the Department of Education shall give priority to applications: (i) that are submitted by school entities that seek funds for discounted broadband services under subsection (l) or for broadband infrastructure, facilities or equipment from local exchange telecommunications companies which contribute to the E-Fund; (ii) that seek funds for regional networks that serve multiple school districts which are filed on behalf of multiple school districts and school entities; or (iii) that are submitted by school entities that do not have broadband service, provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall preclude the department from awarding funds to school entities for telecommunications services, infrastructure or facilities that provide bandwidths greater than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps).

      "text": "§ 3015. Alternative forms of regulation. (a) Inflation offset.-- (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a local exchange telecommunications company with an alternative form of regulation containing a price stability mechanism that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1), (2) or (3) (relating to network modernization plans) shall be subject to a modified inflation offset in its price stability mechanism in adjusting its rates for noncompetitive services, effective upon the filing of an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(e), as follows: (i) If a nonrural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2013, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be zero. (ii) If a nonrural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2015, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be equal to 0.5%. (iii) If a rural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2008, or under section 3014(b)(2)(ii)(A) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2013, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be zero. (iv) If a rural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(2)(ii)(B) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2015, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be equal to 0.5%. (2) Utilizing network modernization plan reports filed with the commission by local exchange telecommunications companies under section 3014(f), the commission shall monitor and enforce companies' compliance with their interim and final 100% commitments for broadband availability in their amended network modernization plans. In the event that a local exchange telecommunications company is found by the commission, after notice and evidentiary hearings held on an expedited basis, to have failed to meet such an interim or final 100% commitment, then the commission shall require the local exchange telecommunications company to refund to customers in its next price stability filing an amount that is just and reasonable under the circumstances. Such amount shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the percentage shortfall of the broadband availability commitment on an access-line basis required to be met during the period from the start of the amended plan or from the date of the last prior interim commitment, as applicable, times the increased revenue that was obtained during this period as a result of the modified inflation offset provided in this section that reduced the inflation offset applicable in the local exchange telecommunications company's alternative regulation plan in effect on the effective date of this section, plus interest calculated under section 1308(d) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). Any such refund required under this subsection shall be separate from and in addition to any civil or other penalties that the commission may impose on a local exchange telecommunications company under Chapter 33 (relating to violations and penalties). (3) Where annual rate adjustments made under a nonrural telecommunications carrier's price stability mechanism are calculated using revenues from protected services, an average rate adjustment for protected residential customer local exchange telecommunications service lines shall be determined by dividing the total protected service revenues associated with such lines, as adjusted by the price stability formula, by the number of such lines, and the rate adjustment for any individual line shall not vary from this average rate adjustment by more than 20%. (b) Rate changes for rural telecommunications carriers.-- (1) In addition to the rate change provisions in its alternative form of regulation plan, a rural telecommunications carrier operating without a price stability mechanism that files with the commission an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1) or (2) shall be permitted at any time to file proposed tariff changes with the commission, effective 45 days after filing, setting forth miscellaneous changes, including increases and decreases, in rates for noncompetitive services, excluding basic residential and business rates, provided such rate changes do not increase the rural telecommunications carrier's annual intrastate revenues by more than 3%. (2) The commission tariff filing requirements and review associated with such proposed rate changes shall be limited to schedules submitted by the rural telecommunications carrier detailing the impact of the rate changes on the carrier's annual intrastate revenues. (3) A rural telecommunications carrier that implements noncompetitive rate changes consistent with the procedure set forth in its alternative form of regulation plan shall be required only to file such financial and cost data with the commission to justify such changes as is required under its commission-approved alternative form of regulation plan. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), (2) or (3), for any rural telecommunications carrier serving less than 50,000 access lines in this Commonwealth and operating under an alternative form of regulation plan, a formal complaint to deny rate changes for noncompetitive services unless signed by at least 20 customers of the rural telecommunications carrier shall not prevent implementation of the rate changes pending the adjudication of the formal complaint by the commission. (c) Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund.-- (1) There is hereby established within the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund for the purposes enumerated in section 3014(i). (2) A local exchange telecommunications company that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(2) or (3) shall be assessed by the commission for contribution to the fund and to the E-fund established under subsection (d) an amount of 20% of the first year's annual revenue effect: (i) of any rate increase permitted by the elimination or reduction of the offset under subsection (a) and placed into effect; or (ii) of any rate increase placed into effect under subsection (b)(1) if the local exchange telecommunications company is operating without a price stability mechanism. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"first year's annual revenue effect\" means the projected or actual increased revenues received by the local exchange telecommunications company during the one-year period from the effective date of its rate increase. The commission shall begin the assessments provided for in this paragraph on June 30, 2005, and thereafter shall make such assessments annually on June 30 until June 30, 2010, for assessments that include amounts for the fund and the e-fund and until June 30, 2015, for assessments that include amounts for only the fund. Each assessment shall be based on the first year's annual revenue effect of any covered rate increase effective after the date of the last annual assessment. (3) An amount not to exceed 50% of such assessment shall be allocated to the fund. The remainder of the assessment shall be allocated to the E-fund provided for under subsection (d) until its termination on June 30, 2011. After the E-fund termination, the maximum assessment percentage shall be reduced from 20% to 10%, and contributions shall be made only to the fund until the local exchange telecommunications company achieves 100% broadband availability. Contributions of allocated amounts shall be paid to the fund and the E-fund by the local exchange telecommunications company in equal quarterly installments. (4) In no event shall the total amount of the fund exceed $5,000,000 annually, and in the event of such overfunding the department shall credit the overcollection to the next year's contribution amount. (5) A local exchange telecommunications company that elects to amend its network modernization plan pursuant to section 3014 (b)(1) shall not be required to contribute to the fund. (6) The moneys in the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund are hereby appropriated upon approval of the Governor to the department for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (1). The department may use up to 3% of the money in the fund for administration. (7) The fund shall continue until July 1, 2016, at which time the fund shall terminate, and the department shall return any funds remaining in the fund on a pro rata basis to the local exchange telecommunications companies that contributed to the fund. (d) Education Technology Fund (E-Fund).-- (1) There is hereby established within the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Education Technology Fund (E-Fund) for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (4). (2) All E-fund assessments imposed by the commission under subsection (c)(2) and paragraph (3), moneys specifically appropriated by the General Assembly for the purposes of this subsection and any funds, contributions or payments which may be made available to the fund by the Federal Government, another State agency or any public or private source for the purpose of implementing this subsection shall be deposited in the E-Fund. (3) Beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, the commission shall, no later than June 30, annually assess each nonrural telecommunications carrier that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) an amount to be deposited in the E-Fund. Each carrier's annual assessment shall be payable in two equal installments due on October 31 of each year and January 31 of the following year and shall be based on the relative proportion of the retail access lines served by the nonrural telecommunications carrier in relation to the number of retail access lines served by all nonrural telecommunications carriers that have filed an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3). For fiscal years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, the total annual assessment amount shall be $7,000,000. For fiscal years 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, the total annual assessment amount shall be the difference between $7,000,000 and any amount remaining in the E-Fund from prior fiscal years which remains unencumbered or unexpended. A nonrural telecommunications carrier's assessments required under this paragraph may not be recovered via a surcharge on customers' bills or in rates for noncompetitive services as exogenous change adjustment under the provisions of the carrier's price stability mechanism and subsection (a)(3) where applicable. (4) Additional local exchange telecommunications company contributions to the E-fund shall be made pursuant to the provisions of subsections (c)(2) and (3). (5) The Department of Education shall expend the moneys of the E-Fund for the purpose of providing grants to school entities as prescribed by section 3014(j). (6) The moneys of the Education Technology Fund are hereby appropriated upon approval of the Governor to the Department of Education for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (5). The Department of Education may use up to 3% of the money for administration. Appropriations by the General Assembly to the fund shall be continuing appropriations and shall not lapse at the close of any fiscal year. (7) The E-Fund shall continue until June 30, 2011, at which time the fund shall terminate and the Department of Education shall return any funds remaining therein on a pro rata basis to the local exchange telecommunications companies that contributed to the fund. (e) General filing requirements.-- The commission's filing and audit requirements for a local exchange telecommunications company that is operating under an amended network modernization plan shall be limited to the following: (1) Network modernization plan reports filed pursuant to section 3014(f). (2) An annual financial report consisting of a balance sheet and income statement. (3) An annual deaf, speech-impaired and hearing-impaired relay information report. (4) An annual service report. (5) Universal service reports. (6) An annual access line report. (7) An annual statement of gross intrastate operating revenues for purposes of calculating assessments for regulatory expenses. (8) An annual State tax adjustment computation for years in which a tax change has occurred, if applicable. (9) For those companies with a bona fide retail request program, a bona fide retail request report under section 3014(c)(9). These reports shall be submitted in the form determined by the commission. (f) Other reports.-- (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title to the contrary, no report, statement, filing or other document or information, except as specified in subsection (e), shall be required of any local exchange telecommunications company unless the commission, upon notice to the affected local exchange telecommunications company and an opportunity to be heard, has first made specific written findings supporting conclusions in an entered order that: (i) The report is necessary to ensure that the local exchange telecommunications company is charging rates that are in compliance with this chapter and its effective alternative form of regulation. (ii) The benefits of the report substantially outweigh the attendant expense and administrative time and effort required of the local exchange telecommunications company to prepare it. (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impede the ability of the commission to require the submission of further information to support the accuracy of or to seek an explanation of the reports specified in subsection (e). (g) Rate change limitations.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the requirement of section 1301 (relating to rates to be just and reasonable) that rates shall be just and reasonable. The annual rate change limitations set forth in a local exchange telecommunications company's effective commission-approved alternative form of regulation plan or any other commission-approved annual rate change limitation shall remain applicable and shall be deemed just and reasonable under section 1301. (h) Conformance of plan.-- Upon approval of a local exchange telecommunications company of network modernization plan amendments pursuant to section 3014(e), the local exchange telecommunications company's alternative form of regulation plan shall be deemed amended consistent with this section.

(a) Commission determination of protected, retail nonprotected and retail noncompetitive services as competitive.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company may petition the commission for a determination of whether a protected or retail noncompetitive service or other business activity in its service territory or a particular geographic area, exchange or group of exchanges or density cell within its service territory is competitive based on the demonstrated availability of like or substitute services or other business activities provided or offered by alternative service providers. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall enter an order granting or denying the petition within 60 days of the filing date or within 150 days of the filing date where a protest is timely filed, or the petition shall be deemed granted. (2) The local exchange telecommunications company shall serve a copy of its petition on the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission. (3) In making its determination, the commission shall consider all relevant information submitted to it, including the availability of like or substitute services or other business activities, and shall limit its determination to the service territory or the particular geographic area, exchange or group of exchanges or density cell in which the service or other business activity has been proved to be competitive. (4) The burden of proving that a protected or retail noncompetitive service or other business activity is competitive rests on the local exchange telecommunications company. (b) Declaration of retail nonprotected services as competitive.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), a local exchange telecommunications company may declare any retail nonprotected service as competitive by filing its declaration with the commission and serving it on the Office of Consumer Advocate, Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission, provided that a local exchange telecommunications company may not use this declaration process for any service that the commission previously has reclassified as noncompetitive under either subsection (c) or prior law. A declaration of a retail nonprotected service as competitive shall be effective upon filing by the local exchange telecommunications company with the commission. (c) Reclassification.-- (1) A party may petition the commission for a determination of whether a service or other business activity previously determined or declared to be competitive is noncompetitive. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall enter an order deciding the petition within 60 days of the filing date or 90 days of the filing date where a protest is timely filed, or the petition shall be approved. (2) The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition on the affected local exchange telecommunications company if the petitioner is not the company, the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission. (3) In making its determination, the commission shall consider all relevant information submitted to it, including the availability of like or substitute services or other business activities, and shall limit its determination to the particular geographic area, exchange or density cell in which the service or other business activity has been proved to be noncompetitive. (4) The burden of proving that a competitive service or other business activity should be reclassified as noncompetitive rests on the party seeking the reclassification. (5) If the commission reclassifies a service or other business activity as noncompetitive, the commission shall determine a just and reasonable rate for the reclassified service or business activity in accordance with section 1301 (relating to rates to be just and reasonable). (d) Additional requirements.-- (1) The prices which a local exchange telecommunications company charges for competitive services shall not be less than the costs to provide the services. (2) The commission may not require tariffs for competitive service offerings to be filed with the commission. (3) A local exchange telecommunications company at its option may tariff its rates subject to rules and regulations applicable to the provision of competitive services. (4) The commission may require a local exchange telecommunications company to maintain price lists with the commission applicable to its competitive services. Price changes that are filed in a company's tariff for competitive services will go into effect on a one-day notice. (e) Pricing flexibility and bundling.-- (1) Subject to the requirements of subsection (d)(1), a local exchange telecommunications company may price competitive services at the company's discretion. (2) A local exchange telecommunications company may offer and bill to customers on one bill bundled packages of services which include nontariffed, competitive, noncompetitive or protected services, including services of an affiliate, in combinations and at a single price selected by the company. A local exchange telecommunications company may file an informational tariff for a bundled package effective on a one-day notice. (3) When an alternative service provider is offering local exchange telecommunications services within an exchange of a rural telecommunications carrier, the rural telecommunications carrier may reduce its prices on services offered within the exchange below the rates set forth in its otherwise applicable tariff in order to meet such competition. A rural telecommunications carrier may not offset revenue reductions resulting from such competitive pricing by increasing rates charged to other customers through its price stability mechanism or otherwise. (f) Prohibitions.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company shall be prohibited from using revenues earned or expenses incurred in conjunction with noncompetitive services to subsidize competitive services. (2) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prevent the marketing and billing of packages containing both noncompetitive and competitive services to customers.

      "heading": "Use of foreign coal by qualifying facilities.",
      "text": "§ 528. Use of foreign coal by qualifying facilities. (a) Legislative findings.-- The General Assembly hereby finds as follows: (1) Potential qualifying facilities which would generate electricity from United States energy sources are, and will for the foreseeable future continue to be, able to supplement adequately the capacity needs of public utilities in this Commonwealth. (2) Some of those qualifying facilities offer the multiple benefits of supplying electricity to Pennsylvania ratepayers at a reasonable price, creating jobs in areas of high unemployment in this Commonwealth and helping to clean up this Commonwealth's environment. (3) Although Federal law places a duty on public utilities to buy electricity generated by qualifying facilities, Federal law does not dictate how the price paid by public utilities and the charges to ratepayers for that electricity are to be calculated. (4) The energy source used by a qualifying facility is a significant factor in determining if a qualifying facility would be able to meet its commitment to supply electricity to a public utility at a reasonable price. (5) Coal mined in a foreign country is subject to major supply interruptions, price increases and quality reductions which are unpredictable and which may result not only from market factors, but also from foreign policy decisions of the United States Government or one or more foreign governments or from domestic policy changes in the foreign country in which the coal is mined. (6) It is much easier for a public utility and the commission to predict the reliability of a qualifying facility and the reasonableness of the price of the electricity to be supplied by that qualifying facility if United States energy sources are to be used than if coal mined in a foreign country is to be used. (7) A qualifying facility which would burn coal mined in a foreign country is too potentially unreliable to justify a public utility in foregoing alternative capacity commitments and in paying the qualifying facility a price which includes any capacity credit. (b) General rule.-- The price paid by a public utility to a qualifying facility and the charge imposed on the utility's ratepayers for electricity generated by that qualifying facility shall not include any capacity credit if that qualifying facility burns coal mined in a foreign country. (c) Restriction on contract approval.-- The commission shall not approve any contract between a public utility and a qualifying facility which burns coal mined in a foreign country for the purchase by the utility of electricity generated by the qualifying facility unless: (1) the price to be paid by the utility reflects no more than the actual avoided cost of the utility when the payment is made; and (2) the contract does not exceed five years in duration. (d) Review of contracts.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a contract in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter between a public utility and a qualifying facility for the purchase by the utility of electricity generated by the qualifying facility shall, after notice and hearing, be subject to review and modification in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) at any time upon complaint or upon the commission's own motion if the qualifying facility burns coal mined in a foreign country. (e) Recovery from ratepayers.-- For the express purpose of implementing the intent of this section, a public utility shall not be permitted to recover from ratepayers pursuant to section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) any of the costs associated with a contract between the utility and a qualifying facility which burns coal mined in a foreign country for the purchase by the utility of electricity generated by the qualifying facility. Any such costs which the commission determines to be reasonable and prudent shall be recoverable only through a base rate proceeding pursuant to Chapter 13 (relating to rates and rate making). (f) Definition.-- For the purposes of this section, \"qualifying facility\" means any cogeneration facility or small power producer which is a qualifying facility pursuant to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's guidelines set forth at 18 CFR §§ 292.101(b)(1) (relating to definitions) and 292.203(a) and (b) (relating to general requirements for qualification). (g) Severability.-- The provisions of this section shall be severable. If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any public utility, qualifying facility or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this section and the application of any provision thereof to any other public utilities, qualifying facilities or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

(a) Phase I compliance.-- On or before February 1, 1993, each public utility shall submit to the commission and may request commission approval of a plan to bring its generating units which use coal to generate electricity into compliance with the Phase I requirements of Title IV of the Clean Air Act (Public Law 95-95, 42 U.S.C. § 7651 et seq.). (b) Phase II compliance.-- On or before January 1, 1996, each public utility shall submit to the commission and may request commission approval of a plan to bring its generating units which use coal to generate electricity into compliance with the Phase II requirements of Title IV of the Clean Air Act. (c) Notice of plan.-- At the same time it submits its plan to the commission, the public utility shall provide a copy of the plan to the Department of Environmental Resources, the Consumer Advocate and the Small Business Advocate. For plans submitted after the effective date of this section, the commission shall cause notice of the utility's filing to be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. The public utility shall make available, upon request, a copy of the proposed plan to any coal supplier with which it has a supply contract for more than one year and to any collective bargaining representative for the coal supplier. (d) Review by commission.-- (1) If the utility has requested commission approval of its plan, the commission shall review the proposed plan on an expedited basis to determine if the utility's proposed compliance plan submitted under this section is in the public interest. (2) After notice and opportunity for a hearing, the commission shall approve or disapprove the compliance plan within nine months after the plan is filed, provided that approval may be in whole or in part and may be subject to such limitations and qualifications as may be deemed necessary and in the public interest. The commission's decision shall establish that the utility's costs of compliance are recoverable costs of service, provided the costs: (i) are reasonable in amount and prudently incurred as determined in an appropriate rate or other proceeding; and (ii) represent investment in flue gas desulfurization devices, clean coal technologies or similar facilities designed to maintain or promote the use of coal, including facilities which intermittently or simultaneously burn natural gas with coal. (3) Costs established as recoverable under paragraph (2) shall qualify as nonrevenue-producing investment to improve environmental conditions under section 1315 (relating to limitation on consideration of certain costs for electric utilities), provided that any benefits to the utility generated by the sale of allowances under the Clean Air Act shall be flowed through to the utility's ratepayers. (4) The utility shall not be required to refile its plan or to seek additional commission approvals concerning its plan unless the utility's plan is significantly amended or revised. (e) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"Clean Air Act\" means Public Law 95-95, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq. and includes the Clean Air Act Amendments (Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399) approved November 15, 1990.

      "text": "§ 2212. City natural gas distribution operations. (a) Application.-- The provisions of this section shall apply only to city natural gas distribution operations. (b) Commission jurisdiction.-- Subject to the provisions of this section, commencing July 1, 2000, public utility service being furnished or rendered by a city natural gas distribution operation within its municipal limits shall be subject to regulation and control by the commission with the same force as if the service were rendered by a public utility. (c) Applicability of other chapters.-- Commencing July 1, 2000, to the extent not inconsistent with this section, the provisions of this title, other than Chapters 11 (relating to certificates of public convenience), 19 (relating to securities and obligations) and 21 (relating to relations with affiliated interests), shall apply to the public utility service of a city natural gas distribution operation with the same force as if the city natural gas distribution operation was a public utility under section 102 (relating to definitions), provided that, upon request of a city natural gas distribution operation, the commission may suspend or waive the application to a city natural gas distribution operation of any provision of this title, including any provision of this chapter other than this section. Chapter 11 shall apply to a city natural gas distribution operation to the extent it seeks to provide natural gas distribution services outside of its corporate or municipal limits. Chapter 19 shall apply to issuances of securities for the benefit of a city natural gas distribution operation by an issuer other than a city to the extent provided in subsection (e) but shall not apply to issuances of securities by a city. (d) Continuation of tariff.-- For purposes of this section, prior tariff means the tariff, rate schedule and riders incorporated into the tariff of a city natural gas distribution operation on the date the commission assumes jurisdiction over such city natural gas distribution operation. A city natural gas distribution operation shall continue to provide natural gas supply and natural gas distribution services to its customers under the prior tariff and the policies or programs existing on the date that the commission assumes jurisdiction over the city natural gas distribution operation until the effective date of the final order entered by the commission approving the restructuring plan and new tariff of the city natural gas distribution operations unless such effective date has been stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, in which event the prior tariff will continue in force until such stay has been dissolved. Where the prior tariff refers to, incorporates or includes a local commission, it shall be interpreted as referring to, incorporating or including the commission. Subject to subsection (s), the commission shall resolve all questions, disputes or conflicts arising under the prior tariff. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent a city natural gas distribution operation from requesting or, if so requested, the commission from approving modifications to the prior tariff at any time prior to the effective date of the final order approving the restructuring plan and new tariff. (e) Securities of city natural gas distribution operations.-- Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, in determining the city natural gas distribution operation's revenue requirement and approving overall rates and charges, the commission shall follow the same ratemaking methodology and requirements that were applicable to the city natural gas distribution operation prior to the assumption of jurisdiction by the commission, and such obligation shall continue until the date on which all approved bonds have been retired, redeemed, advance refunded or otherwise defeased. However, this section shall not prevent the commission from approving changes in the rates payable by any class of ratepayers of the city natural gas distribution operation so long as the revenue requirement and the overall rates and charges are not adversely affected by such changes. Notwithstanding any provision in this title to the contrary, the commission shall permit the city natural gas distribution operation to impose, charge or collect rates or charges as necessary to permit the city or municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) that issued bonds on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation to comply with its covenants to the holders of any approved bonds. Notwithstanding any provision in this title to the contrary, the commission shall not require a city natural gas distribution operation to take action, or omit taking any actions, pursuant to this title if such action or omission would have the effect of causing the interest on tax-exempt bonds issued by a city or municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation to be includable in the gross income of the holders of such bonds for Federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this section, approved bonds shall mean all bonds: (1) issued by a city on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation under the act of October 18, 1972 (P.L.955, No.234), known as The First Class City Revenue Bond Act, or the act of December 7, 1982 (P.L.827, No.231), known as The City of Philadelphia Municipal Utility Inventory and Receivables Financing Act, that were issued and outstanding on the date the commission assumed jurisdiction over the city natural gas distribution operation; (2) issued by the city after the date the commission assumed jurisdiction over the city natural gas distribution operation unless the governing body of the city, at the time of approval of the bond issuance, determines that such bonds shall not be approved bonds; (3) issued by the city or a municipal authority, nonprofit corporation or public corporation formed pursuant to subsection (m) for the purpose of refunding, redeeming, repaying or otherwise defeasing approved bonds; or (4) issued by a municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) for purposes other than refunding, redeeming, repaying or otherwise defeasing approved bonds unless the commission determines, at the time of the registration of a securities certificate pursuant to section 1903 (relating to registration or rejection of securities certificates), that the bonds should not be approved bonds. Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, a city owning a city natural gas distribution operation may continue to issue bonds on behalf of the city natural gas distribution operation pursuant to The First Class City Revenue Bond Act and under The City of Philadelphia Municipal Utility Inventory and Receivables Financing Act, and any municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) may issue bonds on behalf of the city natural gas distribution operation pursuant to the act of May 2, 1945 (P.L.382, No.164), known as the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945, and as otherwise provided by law. All documents that are required to be submitted to the governing body of the city by The First Class City Revenue Bond Act or The City of Philadelphia Municipal Utility Inventory and Receivables Financing Act or, in the case of an issuance of securities by a municipal authority, the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945 shall also be submitted to the commission for its information. Any issuance of securities by a municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation, other than issuances of bonds for the purpose of refunding, redeeming, repaying or otherwise defeasing approved bonds, shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 19 provided that commission determinations with respect to the registration of a securities certificate under Chapter 19 for the issuance of securities by a municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) shall be determinations with respect to public debt and the commission shall employ its abbreviated securities certificate process to such issuances. (f) Transfers to city.-- The commission shall permit the city natural gas distribution operation to impose, charge or collect rates and charges as necessary to permit the city natural gas distribution operation to transfer or pay to the city that is the owner of the city natural gas distribution operation, on an annual basis, such amount as may be specified from time to time in the applicable ordinances of the city or agreements of the city approved by ordinances. If the amount so specified shall exceed 110% of the amount that was authorized for transfer or payment to the city at the close of the fiscal year of the city ending June 30, 2000, such additional amount shall be subject to review and approval of the commission, which approval shall be given unless such additional amount would not be just and reasonable. (g) Restructuring and tariff filings.-- A city natural gas distribution operation shall file with the commission an initial tariff and a restructuring filing consistent with this chapter, and with any orders, rules or regulations adopted by the commission after the effective date of this chapter no later than July 1, 2002, and, unless the city natural gas operation agrees, no earlier than December 31, 2001, pursuant to a schedule to be determined by the commission in consultation with a city natural gas distribution operation. The commission shall conduct an initial rate proceeding pursuant to its procedures for such filings. Hearings on the tariff and restructuring filings shall be held within the municipal limits of the city in which the city natural gas distribution operation is located to the extent practicable. (h) Restructuring proceedings.-- In the restructuring proceeding of a city natural gas distribution operation, in addition to the requirements of section 2204(c) (relating to implementation): (1) The city natural gas distribution operation shall file a plan to convert its existing information technology, accounting, billing, collection, gas purchasing and other operating systems and procedures to comply with the requirements applicable to jurisdictional natural gas utilities under this title and the applicable rules, regulations and orders. The commission shall examine the cost and burdens of converting existing systems and procedures of a city natural gas distribution operation to meet the requirements of this title generally applicable to natural gas distribution companies. If requested by the city natural gas distribution operation, the commission shall determine whether the cost of conversion of any system or procedure is prudent in light of the benefits to be obtained. In the event that the commission determines that the costs would not be prudent, it may waive application to the city natural gas distribution operation of any provision of this title or the commission's rules, regulations and orders as appropriate. In the event that the commission determines that such costs should be incurred, the commission shall permit the city natural gas distribution operation to fully recover such costs through a nonbypassable charge imbedded in the distribution rates of the city natural gas distribution operation. (2) In its restructuring proceeding, a city natural gas distribution operation may propose an automatic adjustment mechanism or mechanisms in lieu of or as a supplement to section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) to adjust rates for fluctuations in gas and nongas costs, including, but not limited to, an automatic adjustment mechanism or mechanisms to recover the costs of providing programs for low-income ratepayers and other assisted ratepayers. The commission may approve or modify the automatic adjustment mechanism or mechanisms proposed by the city natural gas distribution operation, or the commission may approve a section 1307 adjustment for a city natural gas distribution operation. However, the automatic adjustment mechanism, whether section 1307 or any alternative proposed by the city natural gas distribution operation, utilized for city natural gas distribution operations must enable the city or municipal authority formed pursuant to subsection (m) that issued bonds on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation to fully comply at all times with its covenants to the holders of any approved bonds. (i) Powers of the Consumer Advocate; Small Business Advocate.-- The Consumer Advocate shall represent the interests of consumers as a party, or otherwise participate for the purpose of representing an interest of consumers, before the commission in any matter properly before the commission relating to a city natural gas distribution operation. The Consumer Advocate is authorized, in addition to any other authority conferred on him, to represent an interest of consumers which is presented to him for his consideration upon petition in writing by a substantial number of persons who make, direct, use or are ultimate recipients of a product or services supplied by a city natural gas distribution operation. The Small Business Advocate shall represent the interest of small business consumers as a party, or otherwise participate for the purpose of representing an interest of small business consumers, before the commission in any matter properly before the commission relating to a city natural gas distribution operation. The Small Business Advocate is authorized, in addition to any other authority conferred on him, to represent an interest of small business consumers which is presented to him for his consideration upon petition in writing by a substantial number of small business consumers who make, direct, use or are ultimate recipients of a product or services supplied by a city natural gas distribution operation. (j) Commencement of customer choice.-- Beginning with the commencement of the first fiscal year of a city natural gas distribution operation after the order approving the restructuring plan of a city natural gas distribution operation becomes effective, all retail gas customers of city natural gas distribution operations shall have the opportunity to purchase natural gas supply services from a natural gas supplier or the city natural gas distribution operation to the extent it offers the service. After that date, the choice of natural gas suppliers shall rest with the retail gas customer. (k) City instrumentality.-- Unless and until the governing body of a city that owns a city natural gas distribution operation otherwise provides: (1) a city natural gas distribution operation shall be deemed an instrumentality of the city that owns it and independently authorized to establish and maintain pension, welfare and other employee benefit plans for the benefit of those individuals who render services in connection with its operations; and (2) for the purpose of being a participant in such plans or programs, those individuals who render services exclusively and directly related to the operations of the city natural gas distribution operation shall be deemed employees of the city natural gas distribution operation as a distinct entity from the city. If any pension plan established and maintained by or on behalf of a city natural gas distribution operation is or becomes subject to the act of December 18, 1984 (P.L.1005, No.205), known as the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act, the provisions of Chapters 5 and 6 of that act (relating to financially distressed municipal pension system recovery programs) shall not require any pension plan of a city natural gas distribution operation to be aggregated with any pension plan established and maintained by the city. (l) Assisted cities.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, no assisted city shall be required to take any action under this title if the effect of the action is to cause a variation in the financial plan of such assisted city approved pursuant to section 209 of the act of June 5, 1991 (P.L.9, No.6), known as the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority Act for Cities of the First Class. As used in this subsection, \"assisted city\" and \"variation\" shall have the meanings set forth or construed in the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority Act for Cities of the First Class. (m) Corporate action.-- A city that owns a city natural gas distribution operation may form a nonprofit corporation or public corporation or municipal authority under the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945 in order to own, manage, operate, lease or carry out natural gas supply and/or distribution services for, in place of or on behalf of the city natural gas distribution operation, provided that no such entity shall provide natural gas supply services outside of the municipal limits of the city unless licensed as a natural gas supplier. Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c), if a city forms an entity pursuant to this section to provide natural gas supply services, whether inside or outside of the city, the entity shall be deemed an affiliated interest of the city natural gas distribution operation, and Chapter 21 shall apply with respect to that affiliated interest. A municipal authority formed pursuant to the authorization of this section shall not exercise the power of eminent domain outside of the municipal limits of the city in which it is seated. Any entity created under this section or otherwise to own, manage, operate, lease or carry out natural gas supply and/or distribution services for or on behalf of a city or a city natural gas distribution operation shall be deemed a local agency for purposes of 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 85 (relating to matters affecting government units). (n) Collections.-- Nothing contained in this title shall abrogate the power of a city natural gas distribution operation to collect delinquent receivables through the imposition of liens pursuant to section 3 of the act of May 16, 1923 (P.L.207, No.153), referred to as the Municipal Claim and Tax Lien Law, or otherwise. (o) Existing customer contracts.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, where an agreement for natural gas service, evidenced by a signed writing between a city natural gas distribution operation and any customer, exists prior to the date the commission assumes jurisdiction over a city natural gas distribution operation, the customer shall be bound by its terms and conditions and shall not have the right to receive natural gas service from another source until the expiration of the term of the agreement or otherwise pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement. (p) License application and issuance.-- A city natural gas distribution operation may apply for a license pursuant to the procedures under section 2208 (relating to requirements for natural gas suppliers). Subject to the requirement that it qualify for and obtain a natural gas supplier's license under section 2208, a city natural gas distribution operation is authorized to engage in the business of a natural gas supplier outside its municipal or corporate limits. (q) Commission assessment.-- In order to ensure that the commission will be able to carry out its obligations with respect to city natural gas operations, the chief executive officer of a city natural gas distribution operation shall file, no later than March 31, 2000, a sworn statement showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the immediately preceding fiscal year in the same manner as required by section 510(b) (relating to assessment for regulatory expenses upon public utilities). The commission shall use such revenues in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 510(b) and shall bill, no earlier than July 1, 2000, each city natural gas distribution operation its proportional share of the commission's expenses pursuant to section 510(b)(4). A city natural gas distribution operation shall pay the resulting assessment in accordance with and subject to the provisions contained in section 510. (r) Senior citizens.-- (1) The commission may approve a program designed to provide discounted rates for natural gas distribution and supply services to senior citizens residing in the service territory of a city natural gas distribution operation provided that such rates and the terms of such program are just and reasonable. (2) Individual ratepayers who, as of the date the initial tariff of a city natural gas distribution operation becomes effective pursuant to subsection (d), are properly receiving discounted gas rates pursuant to the terms of a program specifically designed to provide assistance to senior citizens contained in the prior tariff shall be entitled to continue to receive such discount under the terms of the prior tariff unless and until the program is modified by ordinance of the governing body of the city, in which event such individuals shall be entitled to receive only the discount provided under the terms of the modified program, as it may be further modified by ordinance from time to time thereafter. (3) Nothing in this title shall require the commission to approve the continuation of the program identified in paragraph (2) in whole or part for any person other than an individual identified in paragraph (2). (s) Powers preserved.-- Nothing contained in this title shall be construed to abrogate or limit the executive or legislative powers of a city that owns a city natural gas distribution operation to legislate or otherwise determine the powers, functions, budgets, activities and mission of the city natural gas distribution operation or any related entity created under subsection (m), including, but not limited to, the ownership, governance, management or control thereof. Nothing in this title shall limit or prevent the proper city officials and agencies from conducting audits and examinations of the financial affairs of the city natural gas distribution operation in accordance with their official duties. (t) Proprietary information.-- Proprietary information, trade secrets and competitively sensitive information of a city natural gas distribution operation shall not be public records for purposes of the act of June 21, 1957 (P.L.390, No.212), referred to as the Right-to-Know Law, and shall not be subject to mandatory public disclosure. Nothing in this section shall exempt a city natural gas distribution operation from providing information to the commission pursuant to its obligation under sections 501 (relating to general powers), 504 (relating to reports by public utilities), 505 (relating to duty to furnish information to commission; cooperation in valuing property) and 506 (relating to inspection of facilities and records).

(a) Requirements.-- (1) Upon the effective date of this section, a transportation network company driver or transportation network company on the driver's behalf shall maintain primary automobile insurance that recognizes that the driver is a transportation network company driver or otherwise uses a vehicle to transport passengers for compensation and covers the driver when: (i) the driver is logged on to the digital network; and (ii) the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride. (2) Unless otherwise required by order or regulation of the commission, the following automobile insurance requirements shall apply to the transportation network company driver or the transportation network company on the driver's behalf while a participating transportation network company driver is logged on to the digital network and is available to receive transportation requests but is not engaged in a prearranged ride: (i) Primary automobile liability insurance in the amount of at least $50,000 for death and bodily injury per person, $100,000 for death and bodily injury per incident and $25,000 for property damage. (ii) First-party medical benefits, including $25,000 for pedestrians and $5,000 for a driver. (iii) The coverage requirements may be satisfied by any of the following: (A) automobile insurance maintained by the transportation network company driver; (B) automobile insurance maintained by the transportation network company; or (C) any combination of clauses (A) and (B). (3) Unless otherwise required by order or regulation of the commission, the following automobile insurance requirements shall apply while a transportation network company driver is engaged in a prearranged ride: (i) Primary automobile liability insurance that provides at least $500,000 for death, bodily injury and property damage. (ii) First-party medical benefits as required by 75 Pa.C.S. § 1711 (relating to required benefits) on a per-incident basis for incidents involving a transportation network company driver's operation of a personal vehicle while engaged in a prearranged ride, including $25,000 for passengers and pedestrians and $5,000 for a driver. (iii) The coverage requirements may be satisfied by any of the following: (A) automobile insurance maintained by the transportation network company driver; (B) automobile insurance maintained by the transportation network company; or (C) any combination of clauses (A) and (B). (3.1) (Reserved). (3.2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1), (2) and (3), insurance coverage required for dual motor carrier drivers that are using personal vehicles to provide transportation network services shall be the same as the insurance coverage required for taxis. The commission may review and increase the insurance coverage requirements for dual motor carriers and taxis as necessary in the public interest. (4) If insurance maintained by a driver under paragraph (2) or (3) has lapsed or does not provide the required coverage, insurance maintained by a transportation network company shall provide the coverage required by this section beginning with the first dollar of a claim, and the transportation network company's insurer shall have the duty to defend such claim. (5) Coverage under an automobile insurance policy maintained under this section shall be primary and not be dependent on a personal automobile insurer first denying a claim nor shall a personal automobile insurance policy be required to first deny a claim. (6) The automobile insurance required for a transportation network company under paragraph (4) shall be evidenced by the filing of a certificate of insurance. The certificate of insurance must be filed, with the commission, by the insurance carrier and must be in the form specified by the commission by order or regulation. (7) Insurance required under this subsection shall be placed with an insurer that has obtained a certificate of authority under section 208 of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.789, No.285), known as The Insurance Department Act of 1921, or a surplus lines insurer eligible under section 1605 of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.682, No.284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (8) Insurance satisfying the requirements of this section shall be deemed to satisfy the financial responsibility requirement for a motor vehicle under 75 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17 (relating to financial responsibility). (9) A transportation network company driver shall carry proof of coverage satisfying paragraphs (2) and (3) when the driver uses a vehicle in connection with a digital network. In the event of an accident, a transportation network company driver shall provide the proof of insurance coverage to the directly interested parties, automobile insurers and investigating police officers under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1786 (relating to required financial responsibility). A transportation network company driver shall also disclose to directly interested parties, automobile insurers and investigating police officers whether the driver was logged on to the digital network or on a prearranged ride at the time of an accident. (10) It shall be the sole and exclusive responsibility of a transportation network company to ensure that automobile insurance coverage required to be carried by the transportation network company driver under this section is in force prior to permitting a transportation network company driver to provide transportation network service. (b) Automobile insurance provisions.-- (1) Insurers that write automobile insurance in this Commonwealth may exclude any and all coverage afforded under the policy issued to an owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any loss or injury that occurs while a driver is logged on to a digital network or while a driver provides a prearranged ride. The right to exclude all coverage may apply to any coverage included in an automobile insurance policy, including, but not limited to: (i) liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage; (ii) uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage; (iii) medical payments coverage; (iv) comprehensive physical damage coverage; (v) collision physical damage coverage; and (vi) first-party medical benefits required under subsection (a)(2)(ii). (2) Notwithstanding any requirement under 75 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17, exclusions under paragraph (1) shall apply. Nothing in this section shall require that a personal automobile insurance policy provide coverage while the driver is logged on to a digital network, while the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride or while the driver otherwise uses a vehicle to transport passengers for compensation. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to preclude an insurer from providing coverage for the personal vehicle if the insurer chooses to do so by contract or endorsement.
