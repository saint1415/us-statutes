The increase, together with all outstanding other additional emergency debt which may have been previously authorized under this subsection excluding any allocated to the additional debt limit under subsection (d), shall not exceed 50% of the borrowing base.

The bonds, notes or obligations shall continue for such term as may have been stated in the notice of election or, if none was stated, for the term the governing body determines. The initial series may be of bond anticipation notes or of notes to be refunded by a bond issue. If the governing body determines it advisable, the initial series of bonds or notes constituting a part of the issue may be for a shorter term of years, with the maturity of subsequent series stated to mature later than the last stated maturity of the preceding series for the same project. This subchapter shall not preclude the issue of additional nonelectoral debt or lease rental debt to complete the project or the issue of additional electoral debt for that purpose if authorized by a subsequent election.",
