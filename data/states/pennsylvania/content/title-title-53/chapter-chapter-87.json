      "text": "(a) General rule.--\n\n(1) In order to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter, a governing body shall use the procedures set forth in subsection (b).\n\n(2) Any governing body after making an election to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter may, after a period of at least three full fiscal years, elect under the provisions of subsection (c) to levy, assess and collect the taxes prohibited by section 8701(b) (relating to general tax authorization) to the extent otherwise provided by law. If the electorate approves such referendum, the governing body shall lose the authority to continue to levy an earned income and net profits tax authorized under this chapter.\n\n(b) Public referendum requirements.--Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements of section 8716 (relating to procedure and administration), a governing body may levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter only by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at only the municipal election preceding the fiscal year when the earned income and net profits tax will be initially imposed. The referendum question must state the initial rate of the proposed earned income and net profits tax, the reason for the tax and the amount of proposed budgeted revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum, expressed as a percent increase over the prior year's budgeted revenue. Any increase in budgeted revenue between the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum and the prior year's budgeted revenue shall not exceed the annual percent change in the Statewide average weekly wage. The question shall be in clear language that is readily understandable by a layperson. For the purpose of illustration, a referendum question may be framed as follows:\n\nDo you favor the imposition of an earned income and net profits tax of X% to be used to replace (names of local taxes to be repealed), reduce real property taxes by X% by means of a homestead exclusion and provide for a one-time revenue increase of X% over the preceding fiscal year?\n\nA nonlegal interpretative statement must accompany the question in accordance with section 201.1 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code, that includes the following: the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax and the maximum allowable rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the estimated revenues to be derived from the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the amount of proposed revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum; the estimated reduction in real property taxes and the elimination of certain existing taxes under this chapter; the identification of the existing taxes to be eliminated under this chapter; the method to be used to reduce real property taxes; the class or classes of real property for which real property taxes would be reduced; and the estimated amount of real property tax reduction by class, expressed as an average percent reduction by class. Any governing body which uses the procedures under this section shall not be subject to the provisions of section 8704 (relating to public referendum requirements for increasing property taxes previously reduced) for any future increases in the earned income and net profits tax rates authorized under this chapter. Any future real property tax rate increases are subject to the provisions of section 8704. If the ballot question fails to receive a majority vote pursuant to this section, approval of the electorate under section 8704 shall not be required to increase the rate of any tax which the governing body of the affected school district is authorized to levy and increase pursuant to any other act.\n\n(c) Public referendum requirements to end participation under this chapter.--Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements in section 4 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, a governing body may elect to end participation under this chapter in accordance with subsection (a)(2) by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at a municipal election.\n\n(d) Public requirements to initiate referendum.--\n\n(1) If the governing body of a school district fails to place a referendum question on the ballot within two years after the effective date of this chapter, the electors of the school district may:\n\n(i) Circulate a petition which, if signed by electors comprising 2% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with the election officials and submitted to the governing body thereof, shall require the governing body to establish a local tax study commission. The provisions under paragraph (2)(v), (vi), (vii), (viii) (ix) and (x) shall not apply to this subparagraph.\n\n(ii) If the local tax study commission makes a recommendation to levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter and the governing body fails to place the recommendation or other alternative of the governing body authorized under this chapter on the ballot in accordance with this chapter at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the submission of the recommendation to the governing body, a petition under this paragraph may be circulated. If the petition is signed by the electors comprising 5% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with election officials at least 90 days prior to the next municipal election, the petition shall compel the election officials to place the recommendation upon the ballot at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the filing of the petition.\n\n(2) The following requirements shall apply to the process under paragraph (1):\n\n(i) The name and street address of each elector signing the petition and of the person filing the petition shall be clearly stated on the petition. The petition shall include an affidavit of the circulator that he or she is a qualified elector of the school district referred to in the petition; that the signers signed with full knowledge of the contents of the petition; that the signers' residences are correctly stated; and that, to the best of the circulator's knowledge and belief, the signers are qualified electors.\n\n(ii) The election officials shall, within ten days after filing, review the petition as to the number and qualifications of signers. If the petition appears to be defective, the election officials shall immediately notify the person filing the petition of the defect and may reject the petition if warranted.\n\n(iii) The petition as submitted to the election officials, along with the list of signatories, shall be open to public inspection in the office of the election officials.\n\n(iv) If the election officials find that the petition as submitted is in proper order, they shall send copies of the petition without signatures thereon to the governing body involved.\n\n(v) The procedure for the referendum shall be governed by the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code.\n\n(vi) If the election officials find the petition meets the requirements of this chapter, they shall place the proposal on the ballot in a manner fairly representing the content of the petition for decision by referendum at the proper election.\n\n(vii) The election officials shall certify the date for the referendum and shall notify the governing body at least 30 days prior to such date.\n\n(viii) At least 30 days' notice of the referendum shall be given by proclamation of the governing body. A copy of the proclamation shall be posted at each polling place on the day of the election and shall be published once in at least one newspaper of general circulation which is distributed within the school district during the 30-day period prior to the election.\n\n(ix) Approval of a referendum shall be by majority vote of those voting in the school district involved.\n\n(x) The election officials shall certify the results of the referendum to the governing body.\n\n(e) School districts located in more than one county.--\n\n(1) In the event a school district is located in more than one county, petitions under this section shall be filed with the election officials of the county wherein the administrative offices of the school district are located.\n\n(2) The election officials receiving a petition shall be responsible for all administrative functions in reviewing and certifying the validity of the petition and for making all necessary communications with the school district.\n\n(3) If the election officials of the county receiving the petition certify that it is sufficient under this subpart and determine that a question should be placed upon the ballot, such decision shall be communicated to election officials in any other county in which the school district is also located. Election officials in the other county or counties shall cooperate with election officials of the county receiving the petition to insure that an identical question is placed on the ballot at the same election throughout the entire school district.\n\n(4) Election officials from each county involved shall independently certify the results from their county to the governing body.\n\nCross References.Section 8703 is referred to in sections 8022, 8402, 8701, 8704, 8706, 8713, 8716, 8717 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) General rule.--Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), a governing body that elects to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter pursuant to section 8703(a) (relating to adoption of referendum) shall not increase the rate of its tax on real property without first obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a referendum at the primary election immediately preceding the fiscal year of the proposed tax increase.\n\n(b) Disapproval.--Whenever the electorate fails to approve the proposed referendum question to increase the rate of tax on real property under subsection (a), the governing body shall be limited to the rate of tax in effect prior to the referendum.\n\n(c) Exception to general rule.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to an increase in the rate of the real property tax that does not cause local tax revenue, excluding real property taxes to be levied on newly constructed buildings or structures or on increased valuations based on new improvements made to existing houses, to increase by more than the percentage increase in the Statewide average weekly wage in the preceding year. Prior to any increase under this subsection, the governing body must certify to the court of common pleas in the judicial district in which the governing body is located the estimates of total local tax revenues used in the calculation under this subsection. The court may, on its own motion or on petition of a person having standing under subsection (f), revise the estimates certified by the governing body and reduce the allowable increase in the rate of the real property tax under this subsection.\n\n(d) Referendum exceptions.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to increases in the rate of tax on real property in this subsection only if the exception to the general rule under subsection (c) has been utilized, if applicable, to the maximum amount allowed:\n\n(1) To respond to or recover from an emergency or disaster declared pursuant to 35 Pa.C.S. § 7301 (relating to general authority of Governor) or 75 Pa.C.S. § 6108 (relating to power of Governor during emergency), only for the duration of the emergency or disaster and for the costs of the recovery from the emergency or disaster.\n\n(2) To implement a court order or an administrative order from a Federal or State agency that requires the expenditure of funds that exceed current available revenues. The rate increase shall be rescinded following fulfillment of the court order or administrative order.\n\n(3) To pay interest and principal on any indebtedness incurred under Subpart B (relating to indebtedness and borrowing). However, in no case may a school district incur additional debt under this paragraph, except for the refinancing of existing debt, including the payment of costs and expenses related to such refinancing and the establishment or funding of appropriate debt service reserves. The increase shall be rescinded following the final payment of interest and principal. The exception provided under this paragraph shall not be used to avoid referendum requirements to pay for costs which could not be financed by the issuance of debt under Subpart B.\n\n(4) To respond to conditions that pose an immediate threat of serious physical harm or injury to the students, staff or residents of the school district until the circumstances causing the threat have been fully resolved.\n\n(5) Special purpose tax levies approved by the electorate.\n\n(6) To maintain per-student local tax revenue in the school district at an amount not exceeding the amount of per-student local tax revenue at the level of the preceding year, adjusted for the percentage increase in the Statewide average weekly wage. This paragraph shall apply only if the percentage growth in student enrollment in the school district between the current fiscal year and the third fiscal year immediately preceding the current fiscal year exceeds 10%. For the purposes of this paragraph, student enrollment shall be measured by average daily membership as defined by the act of March 10, 1949 (P.L.30, No.14), known as the Public School Code of 1949. For the purposes of this paragraph, per-student local tax revenue shall be determined by dividing local tax revenue by average daily membership.\n\n(e) Court action.--Prior to the imposition of the tax increase under subsection (d)(1), (2), (4) or (6), approval is required by the court of common pleas in the judicial district in which the governing body is located. The governing body shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation a notice of its intent to file an action under this subsection at least one week prior to the filing of the petition. The governing body shall also publish in a newspaper of general circulation notice, as soon as possible following notification from the court that a hearing has been scheduled, stating the date, time and place of the hearing on the petition. The following shall apply to any proceedings instituted under this subsection:\n\n(1) The governing body must prove by clear and convincing evidence the necessity for the tax increase.\n\n(2) The governing body must prove by clear and convincing evidence that there are no assets or other feasible alternatives available to the school district.\n\n(3) The court shall determine the appropriate duration of the increase and may retain continuing jurisdiction. The court may, on its own motion or on petition of an interested party, revoke approval for or order rescission of a tax increase.\n\n(f) Standing.--A person shall have standing as a party to a proceeding under this section as long as the person resides within or pays real property taxes to the taxing jurisdiction of the governing body instituting the action.\n\nCross References.Section 8704 is referred to in sections 8701, 8703, 8706 of this title.",
