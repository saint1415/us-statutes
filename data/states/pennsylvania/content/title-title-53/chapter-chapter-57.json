Every taxicab or limousine service shall keep copies of tariffs open to public inspection under rules and regulations as the authority may prescribe. Upon request, the taxicab or limousine service shall make available at least one copy of any rate filing at a convenient location and for a reasonable length of time within a city of the first class for inspection and study by customers.\n\n(c) Adherence to tariffs.--No taxicab or limousine service shall, directly or indirectly, by any device whatsoever or in any way, demand or receive from any person, corporation or municipal corporation a greater or lesser rate for any service rendered or to be rendered by the taxicab or limousine service than that specified in the tariffs of the taxicab or limousine service.\n\n(d) Discrimination in rates.--No taxicab or limousine service shall make or grant any unreasonable preference or advantage to any person, corporation or municipal corporation or subject any person, corporation or municipal corporation to any unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage concerning its rate.

This subsection shall not prohibit the establishment of reasonable zone or group systems or classifications of rates.\n\n(e) Voluntary changes in rates.--\n\n(1) Unless the authority otherwise orders, no taxicab or limousine service shall make any change in any existing and duly established rate except after 60 days' notice to the authority which shall plainly state the changes proposed to be made in the rates then in force and the time when the changed rates will go into effect. The taxicab or limousine service shall also give notice of the proposed changes to other interested persons as the authority, in its discretion, may direct. The notices regarding the proposed changes which are provided shall be in plain, understandable language as the authority prescribes. All proposed changes shall be shown by filing new tariffs or supplements to existing tariffs filed and in force at the time. The authority, for good cause shown, may allow changes in rates without requiring the 60 days' notice under conditions as it may prescribe.\n\n(2) Whenever there is filed with the authority by any taxicab or limousine service any tariff stating a new rate, the authority may, either upon complaint or upon its own motion and upon reasonable notice, conduct a hearing concerning the lawfulness of the rate. Pending the hearing and its outcome, the authority, upon filing the tariff and delivering to the taxicab or limousine service affected a statement in writing of its reasons may, at any time before it becomes effective, suspend the operation of the rate for a period not longer than nine months from the time it would otherwise become effective. The rate in force when the tariff stating the new rate was filed shall continue in force during the period of suspension unless the authority shall establish a temporary rate. The authority shall consider the effect of the suspension in finally determining and prescribing the rates to be charged and collected by the taxicab or limousine service.\n\n(3) If, after the hearing conducted pursuant to paragraph (2), the authority finds any rate to be unjust or unreasonable or in any way in violation of law, it shall determine the just and reasonable rate to be charged or applied by the taxicab or limousine service for the service in question and shall fix the rate by order to be served upon the taxicab or limousine service. The rate shall then be observed until changed.\n\n(f) Temporary rates.--The authority may, in any proceeding involving the rates of a taxicab or limousine service, after reasonable notice and hearing and, if the public interest requires, immediately fix, determine and prescribe temporary rates to be charged by a taxicab or limousine service, pending the final determination of the rate proceeding.\n\n(g) Fair return.--In fixing any rate of a taxicab or limousine service engaged exclusively as a common carrier by motor vehicle, the authority may fix the fair return by relating the fair and reasonable operating expenses, depreciation, taxes and other costs of furnishing service to operating revenues.\n\n(h) Refunds.--If, in any proceeding involving rates, the authority determines that any rate received by a taxicab or limousine service was unjust or unreasonable or was in violation of any regulation or order of the authority or was in excess of the applicable rate contained in an existing and effective tariff of the taxicab or limousine service, the authority shall have the power to make an order requiring the public utility to refund the amount of any excess paid by any patron.\n\n(July 16, 2004, P.L.758, No.94, eff. imd.)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 94 reenacted and amended section 5703.\n\n2004 Unconstitutionality.Act 230 of 2002 was declared unconstitutional.

Except as provided in section 5710 (relating to fees), the authority's proposed budget shall include a proposed fee schedule.\n\n(2) The authority's proposed budget shall include an estimate of the amount of its expenditures necessary to meet its obligation to administer and enforce this chapter. The authority shall subtract from the expenditure estimate:\n\n(i) The estimated fees to be collected under section 5710 during the fiscal year.\n\n(ii) Money deposited into the regulatory fund as payment for assessments, fees or penalties and any other moneys collected pursuant to this chapter but not allocated during a prior fiscal year.

The limousine assessment shall be applied to each limousine in the limousine utility group and shall be paid by the owner of each limousine on that basis.\n\n(iv) The authority may not make an additional assessment against a vehicle substituted for another already in limousine service during the fiscal year and already subject to assessment as provided in subparagraph (iii).

The authority may by regulation define categories of limousine service. The authority may separately grant certificates of public convenience for each category of limousine service and specify the rights associated with the certificates of public convenience by category of limousine service.\n\n(a.1) Advance reservation limousine service.--A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service within a city of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon advance reservation:\n\n(1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued;\n\n(2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth;\n\n(3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate issued; and\n\n(4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as part of a continuous trip.\n\n(a.2) Other limousine service.--A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide nonexclusive, scheduled limousine service may transport persons and their baggage to or from any airport, railroad station or hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class without advance reservation in accordance with rules and regulations established by the authority.\n\n(a.3) Commission limousine certificate holders.--A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service in a city of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the commission authorizing limousine service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and their baggage:\n\n(1) to a city of the first class upon advance reservation and in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and\n\n(2) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond the city of the first class upon advance reservation in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience, excluding service from any airport, railroad station and hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class.\n\n(b) Enforcement.--\n\n(1) The provisions of this subchapter and the rules and regulations promulgated by the authority pursuant to this subchapter shall be enforced within cities of the first class by authority personnel.\n\n(2) The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission may initiate actions before the authority.\n\n(c) Restrictions.--\n\n(1) Certificates issued pursuant to this subchapter shall be nontransferable unless a transfer is approved by the authority.\n\n(2) A limousine service provider operating pursuant to an authority-issued certificate of public convenience and a filed tariff permitting the limousine service provider to charge mileage-based rates on the effective date of this paragraph shall be permitted to continue to charge mileage-based rates and to be regulated in the same manner as traditional limousine service providers.\n\n(d) Penalties involving certified limousines.--Operating a certificated limousine in violation of this subchapter and authority regulations with regard to limousine service in a city of the first class or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense.
