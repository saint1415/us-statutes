The court shall then appoint three disinterested commissioners, all residents and taxpayers of the county, but none residing in or owners of real property in any of the municipalities. After hearing, notice of which shall be given to the municipalities as the court shall direct, the commissioners shall file a report with the court making an adjustment and apportionment of all the property as well as the obligations or indebtedness. The report shall state the amount that shall be due and payable from each municipality, the forms of payment and the amount of obligations and indebtedness that shall be assumed by each.\n\n(d) Notice to municipalities.--The commissioners shall give the municipalities at least five days' written notice of the filing of their report. Unless exceptions are filed to the report within 30 days after the date of the filing, the report shall be confirmed by the court absolutely. Any sum awarded by the report shall be a legal and valid claim in its favor against the municipality charged. Any real or personal property given to a municipality shall become its property. Any claim or indebtedness charged against the municipality may be collected from it.\n\n(e) Exceptions to report.--If exceptions are filed to the report of the commissioners, the court shall dispose of them, taking testimony if it deems advisable. The court shall enter its decree confirming the award of the commissioners or modifying the same as appears just and proper.\n\n(f) Compensation to commissioners.--The commissioners shall be allowed any compensation and expenses for their services as the court shall fix. The costs of the proceedings, including the compensation and expenses of the commissioners, shall be apportioned by the court between the municipalities as it deems proper.\n\n(g) Jurisdiction of court.--If a municipality or part of a municipality is located in two or more counties, the court of common pleas of the county where the larger part of the municipality assuming the function is located shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the proceedings.\n\n(May 5, 1998, P.L.301, No.50, eff. 60 days)\n\n1998 Amendment.Act 50 amended subsec.
