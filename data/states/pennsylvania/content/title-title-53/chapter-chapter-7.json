determine in its judgment which form of government is more clearly responsible or accountable to the people and its operation more economical and efficient.\n\n(3) If a new home rule charter is found to be the most advisable form of government for the proposed consolidated or merged municipality, the commission shall:\n\n(i) Draft and recommend to the electorate a new home rule charter for the

authorizing a consolidated or merged municipality adopting a new home rule charter pursuant to this section to exercise powers not granted to a municipality adopting a home rule charter pursuant to Subpart E of Part III (relating to home rule and optional plan government).\n\n(ii) If the new home rule charter calls for all or any part of the governing body of the consolidated or merged

limited to, reasonable estimations of the necessary expenses of commission members, compensation of consultants, clerical personnel and other assistants and other expenditures incident to work of the commission.\n\n(4) The commission shall prepare and submit an initial budget submission that estimates expenses for the first nine-month phase of the commission's work. The initial budget estimate shall be submitted as soon as possible and in any event no later than 45 days after the commission's certification of election.\n\n(5) If, during the first nine-month phase of its work, the commission elects to prepare and submit a new home rule charter for the proposed consolidated or merged municipality, a final budget shall be submitted to the governing body of each of the municipalities being considered for consolidation or merger that estimates expenses to be incurred in the completion of the commission's work.\n\n(6) No later than 15 days after the submission of a budget in accordance with paragraphs (4) or (5), a joint public hearing of the commission and the governing bodies of the municipalities shall be held.

Any unreasonable modification of the budget may be subject to an action as provided in paragraph (8) in the court of common pleas of any county wherein a municipality to be consolidated or merged lies.\n\n(7) If a majority in each of the municipalities to be consolidated or merged vote in favor of establishing a commission, the municipalities may, by agreement, determine the share that each municipality shall appropriate to fund the estimated budget of the commission. If no agreement as to the respective amount that each municipality shall appropriate is reached, each municipality shall appropriate funds equal to its pro rata share of the total estimated budget of the commission based upon its share of population to the total population of the municipalities to be consolidated or merged.\n\n(7.1) When a commission is formed to study consolidation or merger by a vote of the whole in the municipalities considering the question, the municipalities that vote in the affirmative shall be responsible for funding the budget of the commission. Any municipalities that vote in the negative on the question shall not be responsible for the budget costs of the commission.\n\n(8) The commission may bring an action in the court of common pleas of the county where a municipality is located requesting that the court determine whether the municipality has failed to reasonably modify an estimated budget or to appropriate moneys in accordance with this subsection. The court may provide appropriate relief, including, but not limited to, ordering appropriation of funds in accordance with the budget:\n\n(i) as submitted by the commission or as modified by the municipalities; or\n\n(ii) as modified by the court.\n\n(9) In all cases, the costs and fees of any action brought by the commission under this subsection shall be paid by the municipality or municipalities named as defendants.\n\n(10) A municipality shall be entitled to a proportionate reimbursement or offset of its share of the budget by any publicly or privately contributed funds or services made available to the commission.\n\n(m) Hearings and public forums.--A commission shall hold one or more public hearings and sponsor public forums and generally shall provide for the widest possible public information and discussion respecting the purposes and progress of its work.\n\n(n) Report of findings and recommendations.--\n\n(1) A commission shall report its findings and recommendations to the citizens of the proposed consolidated or merged municipalities within nine months from the date of its election, except that it shall be permitted an additional nine months if it elects to prepare and submit a proposed new home rule charter and an additional two months if it chooses to provide for the election of its governing body by districts. It shall publish or cause to be published sufficient copies of its final report for public study and information and shall deliver to the municipal clerk or secretary of each municipality proposed to be consolidated or merged sufficient copies of the report to supply it to any interested citizen upon request. If the commission recommends the adoption of a new home rule charter, the report shall contain the complete plan as recommended.\n\n(2) There shall be attached to each copy of the report of the commission, as a part thereof, a statement sworn to by the members of the commission listing in detail the funds, goods, materials and services, both public and private, used by the commission in the performance of its work and the preparation and filing of the report and identifying specifically the supplier of each item thereon.\n\n(3) A copy of the final report of the commission with its findings and recommendations shall be filed with the Department of Community and Economic Development.\n\n(4) All the records, reports, tapes, minutes of meetings and written discussions of the commission shall, upon its discharge, be turned over to the municipal clerk or secretary of each municipality proposed to be consolidated or merged for permanent safekeeping and made available for public inspection at any time during regular business hours.\n\n(o) Discharge of petition and amended reports.--\n\n(1) A commission shall be discharged upon the filing of its report, but, if the commission's recommendations require further procedure in the form of a referendum on the part of the electors, the commission shall not be discharged until the procedure has been concluded. At any time prior to 60 days before the date of the referendum, the commission may modify or change any recommendation set forth in the final report by publishing an amended report.\n\n(2) Whenever the commission issues an amended report pursuant to paragraph (1), the amended report shall supersede the final report, and the final report shall cease to have any legal effect.\n\n(3) The procedure to be taken under the amended report shall be governed by the provisions of this subpart applicable to the final report of the commission submitted pursuant to subsection (n).\n\n(p) Types of action recommended.--A commission shall report and recommend in accordance with this section:\n\n(1) That a referendum shall be held that submits to the electors the question of consolidating or merging the named municipalities under a new home rule charter as prepared by the commission.\n\n(2) That no referendum shall be held because consolidation or merger of the named municipalities under a new home rule charter is not recommended by the commission.\n\n(3) That the named municipalities consider such other action as the commission recommends and deems advisable consistent with its functions as set forth in this section.\n\n(q) Specificity of recommendations.--\n\n(1) If a commission recommends the adoption of a new home rule charter, it shall specify the number of members to be on the governing body, all offices to be filled by election and whether elections shall be on an at-large, district or combination district and at-large basis.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, if an approved new home rule charter adopted pursuant to the provisions of this subpart specifies that the election of the governing body should be on an at-large, district or combination district and at-large basis and the basis recommended differs from the existing basis and therefore requires the elimination of districts or the establishment of revised or new districts, then election of municipal officials shall not take place on the new basis until the municipal election following the next primary election taking place more than 180 days after the election at which the referendum on the question of a consolidation or merger and new home rule charter has been approved by the electorate. The consolidation or merger and new home rule charter shall not go into effect until the first Monday in January following the election of municipal officials on the new basis as provided in section 738 (relating to effectuation of consolidation or merger).

The commission may cause the question to be submitted to the electors at the next primary, municipal or general election occurring not less than 60 days following the filing of a copy of the commission's report with the county board of elections, at the time the commission's report directs. At the election, the question of adopting consolidation or merger and a new home rule charter recommended by the commission shall be submitted to the electors by the county board of elections in the same manner as other questions are submitted to the electors under the Pennsylvania Election Code. The commission shall frame the question to be placed upon the ballot as provided for in subsection (r) and, if it deems appropriate, an interpretative statement to accompany the question.\n\n(t) Amendment of new home rule charter.--The procedure for amending the new home rule charter of the consolidated or merged municipality created under this subpart shall be through the initiative procedure and referendum or ordinance of the governing body as provided for in Subchapter C of Chapter 29 (relating to amendment of existing charter or optional plan).\n\n(u) General powers and limitation of consolidated or merged municipality under new home rule charter.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing a consolidated or merged municipality adopting a new home rule charter to exercise powers not granted to a municipality adopting a home rule charter pursuant to Subpart E of Part III.\n\n(v) Definition.--(Deleted by amendment).\n\n(Oct. 23, 2003, P.L.180, No.29, eff. 60 days; Oct. 27, 2010, P.L.980, No.102, eff. 60 days; Sept. 24, 2014, P.L.2452, No.131, eff. 60 days)\n\n2014 Amendment.Act 131 amended subsecs.
