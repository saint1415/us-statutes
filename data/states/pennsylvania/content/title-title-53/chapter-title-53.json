(2) Maintain universal telecommunications service at affordable rates while encouraging the accelerated provision of advanced services and deployment of a universally available, state-of-the-art, interactive broadband telecommunications network in rural, suburban and urban areas, including deployment of broadband facilities in or adjacent to public rights-of-way abutting public schools, including the administrative offices supporting public schools, industrial parks and health care facilities. (3) Ensure that customers pay only reasonable charges for protected services which shall be available on a nondiscriminatory basis. (4) Ensure that rates for protected services do not subsidize the competitive ventures of telecommunications carriers. (5) Provide diversity in the supply of existing and future telecommunications services and products in telecommunications markets throughout this Commonwealth by ensuring that rates, terms and conditions for protected services are reasonable and do not impede the development of competition. (6) Ensure the efficient delivery of technological advances and new services throughout this Commonwealth in order to improve the quality of life for all Commonwealth residents. (7) Encourage the provision of telecommunications products and services that enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. (8) Promote and encourage the provision of competitive services by a variety of service providers on equal terms throughout all geographic areas of this Commonwealth without jeopardizing the provision of universal telecommunications service at affordable rates. (9) Encourage the competitive supply of any service in any region where there is market demand. (10) Encourage joint ventures between local exchange telecommunications companies and other entities where such joint ventures accelerate, improve or otherwise assist a local exchange telecommunications company in implementing its network modernization plan. (11) Establish a bona fide retail request program to aggregate and make advanced services available in areas where sufficient market demand exists and to supplement existing network modernization plans. (12) Promote and encourage the provision of advanced services and broadband deployment in the service territories of local exchange telecommunications companies without jeopardizing the provision of universal service. (13) Recognize that the regulatory obligations imposed upon the incumbent local exchange telecommunications companies should be reduced to levels more consistent with those imposed upon competing alternative service providers.

(2) If the department determines that there is no positive percentage change, then no adjustment to the base amounts shall occur for the relevant time period provided for in this subsection. (3) (i) If the department determines that there is a positive percentage change in the first year that the determination is made under paragraph (1), the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by each base amount, and the products shall be added to the base amounts, respectively, and the sums shall be preliminary adjusted amounts. (ii) The preliminary adjusted amounts shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a)(1), (b) and (c). (4) In each successive year in which there is a positive percentage change in the CPI-U for the United States City Average, the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by the most recent preliminary adjusted amounts, and the products shall be added to the preliminary adjusted amount of the prior year to calculate the preliminary adjusted amounts for the current year. The sums thereof shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the new final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a)(1), (b) and (c). (5) The determinations and adjustments required under this subsection shall be made in the period between October 1 and November 15 of the year following the effective date of this subsection and annually between October 1 and November 15 of each year thereafter.

(f) Entry into contracts.-- (1) Subject to subsection (e), an authority may enter into and carry out contracts or establish or comply with rules and regulations concerning labor and materials and other related matters in connection with a project or portion thereof as the authority deems desirable or as may be requested by a Federal agency to assist in the financing of the project or any part thereof.

(2) This subsection is intended to make unlawful the practice of evading advertising requirements by making a series of purchases or contracts each for less than the advertising requirement price or by making several simultaneous purchases or contracts each below that price when in either case the transaction involved should have been made as one transaction for one price. (3) An authority member who votes to unlawfully evade the provisions of this section and who knows that the transaction upon which the member votes is or ought to be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids commits a misdemeanor of the third degree for each contract entered into as a direct result of that vote.

(a) Commission determination of protected, retail nonprotected and retail noncompetitive services as competitive.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company may petition the commission for a determination of whether a protected or retail noncompetitive service or other business activity in its service territory or a particular geographic area, exchange or group of exchanges or density cell within its service territory is competitive based on the demonstrated availability of like or substitute services or other business activities provided or offered by alternative service providers. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall enter an order granting or denying the petition within 60 days of the filing date or within 150 days of the filing date where a protest is timely filed, or the petition shall be deemed granted. (2) The local exchange telecommunications company shall serve a copy of its petition on the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission. (3) In making its determination, the commission shall consider all relevant information submitted to it, including the availability of like or substitute services or other business activities, and shall limit its determination to the service territory or the particular geographic area, exchange or group of exchanges or density cell in which the service or other business activity has been proved to be competitive. (4) The burden of proving that a protected or retail noncompetitive service or other business activity is competitive rests on the local exchange telecommunications company. (b) Declaration of retail nonprotected services as competitive.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), a local exchange telecommunications company may declare any retail nonprotected service as competitive by filing its declaration with the commission and serving it on the Office of Consumer Advocate, Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission, provided that a local exchange telecommunications company may not use this declaration process for any service that the commission previously has reclassified as noncompetitive under either subsection (c) or prior law. A declaration of a retail nonprotected service as competitive shall be effective upon filing by the local exchange telecommunications company with the commission. (c) Reclassification.-- (1) A party may petition the commission for a determination of whether a service or other business activity previously determined or declared to be competitive is noncompetitive. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall enter an order deciding the petition within 60 days of the filing date or 90 days of the filing date where a protest is timely filed, or the petition shall be approved. (2) The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition on the affected local exchange telecommunications company if the petitioner is not the company, the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission. (3) In making its determination, the commission shall consider all relevant information submitted to it, including the availability of like or substitute services or other business activities, and shall limit its determination to the particular geographic area, exchange or density cell in which the service or other business activity has been proved to be noncompetitive. (4) The burden of proving that a competitive service or other business activity should be reclassified as noncompetitive rests on the party seeking the reclassification. (5) If the commission reclassifies a service or other business activity as noncompetitive, the commission shall determine a just and reasonable rate for the reclassified service or business activity in accordance with section 1301 (relating to rates to be just and reasonable). (d) Additional requirements.-- (1) The prices which a local exchange telecommunications company charges for competitive services shall not be less than the costs to provide the services. (2) The commission may not require tariffs for competitive service offerings to be filed with the commission. (3) A local exchange telecommunications company at its option may tariff its rates subject to rules and regulations applicable to the provision of competitive services. (4) The commission may require a local exchange telecommunications company to maintain price lists with the commission applicable to its competitive services. Price changes that are filed in a company's tariff for competitive services will go into effect on a one-day notice. (e) Pricing flexibility and bundling.-- (1) Subject to the requirements of subsection (d)(1), a local exchange telecommunications company may price competitive services at the company's discretion. (2) A local exchange telecommunications company may offer and bill to customers on one bill bundled packages of services which include nontariffed, competitive, noncompetitive or protected services, including services of an affiliate, in combinations and at a single price selected by the company. A local exchange telecommunications company may file an informational tariff for a bundled package effective on a one-day notice. (3) When an alternative service provider is offering local exchange telecommunications services within an exchange of a rural telecommunications carrier, the rural telecommunications carrier may reduce its prices on services offered within the exchange below the rates set forth in its otherwise applicable tariff in order to meet such competition. A rural telecommunications carrier may not offset revenue reductions resulting from such competitive pricing by increasing rates charged to other customers through its price stability mechanism or otherwise. (f) Prohibitions.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company shall be prohibited from using revenues earned or expenses incurred in conjunction with noncompetitive services to subsidize competitive services. (2) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prevent the marketing and billing of packages containing both noncompetitive and competitive services to customers.

Any county, city, borough, town or township is authorized to transfer, assign and set over to an authority a contract awarded by the county, city, borough, town or township for the construction of projects not begun or, if begun, not completed. The territory being served by a project or the territory within which the project is authorized to render service at the time of the acquisition of the project by an authority shall constitute the area in which the authority is authorized to render service. (b) Acquisition.-- (1) An authority may not acquire by any device or means, including a consolidation, merger, purchase or lease or through the purchase of stock, bonds or other securities, title to or possession or use of all or a substantial portion of a project which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission without the approval of the commission evidenced by its certificate of public convenience obtained in accordance with the procedure and investigations as to value as provided in 66 Pa.C.S. § 1103 (relating to procedure to obtain certificates of public convenience). The commission shall also consider the earning power of the project in deciding the value of the project. As used in this paragraph, the term \"acquire\" includes only the acquisition of existing facilities. (2) The authority shall first report to and advise the parent municipality of the agreement to acquire, including all its terms and conditions. (3) The proposed action of the authority and the proposed agreement to acquire must be approved by the legislative body. Approval must be by two-thirds vote of all of the members of the legislative body. (c) Complete provision.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section, without reference to any other law, shall be deemed complete for the acquisition by agreement of a project located wholly within or partially without the municipality causing the authority to be incorporated, and no proceedings or other action shall be required except as prescribed in this section.

(a) Members of council.-- (1) If a vacancy exists in the municipal council, the municipal council shall, by a majority of its remaining members, fill the vacancy within 30 days thereafter by electing a qualified person to serve until that first Monday of January when his successor is duly sworn into office for the remainder of the term of the person originally elected to the office. The successor shall be elected at the next municipal election occurring at least 50 days after the vacancy begins. (2) In case vacancies should exist whereby the offices of a majority or more members of the municipal council become vacant, the remaining members shall fill the vacancies, one at a time, giving each new appointee reasonable notice of his appointment as will enable him to meet and act with the then qualified member or members of the municipal council in making further appointments until a bare majority of members of municipal council members have been qualified. At that time these members shall appoint persons to fill the remaining vacancies at a meeting attended by the majority members of municipal council, such appointees to receive a majority of the votes of the members present at the meeting. Each person selected to fill the vacancy or vacancies shall hold his office as provided in this subsection. (3) If, by reason of a tie vote or otherwise, the vacancy shall not have been filled by the remaining members of municipal council within the time as limited in this subsection, the court of common pleas upon the petition of ten or more qualified electors shall fill the vacancy by the appointment of a qualified person for the portion of the unexpired term as provided in this subsection. (b) Other officers.-- (1) If a vacancy occurs in the office of executive (mayor), municipal treasurer, if elected, municipal controller, if elected, county district attorney or county sheriff, if elected, the municipal council shall fill the vacancy within 30 days thereafter by choosing an executive (mayor), a municipal treasurer, a municipal controller, a county district attorney or a county sheriff, as the case may be, to serve until his successor is elected by the qualified electors at the next municipal election occurring at least 50 days after the vacancy occurs and is duly sworn into office. The person so elected shall serve from the first Monday of January next succeeding his election for the remainder of the term of the person originally elected to the office. (2) If, by reason of a tie vote or otherwise, a vacancy in the office of executive (mayor), treasurer, controller, county district attorney or county sheriff has not been filled by council within the time as limited in this subsection, the court of common pleas, upon petition of ten or more qualified electors, shall fill the vacancy by the appointment of a qualified person for the portion of the unexpired term as provided in this subsection.",

      "text": "§ 3162. Status and term of office of officials. (a) Existing elected official.-- Any elected municipal official in office at the time of the adoption of any optional plan provided by this subpart shall continue in office only until the new plan of government goes into effect as provided in section 3161 (relating to applicability of plan), except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d). (b) Members of council.-- At the municipal election next succeeding the adoption of one of the optional plans provided for in this subpart, if four or fewer council members are elected, they shall serve for terms of four years. If five are elected, the four successful candidates receiving the highest percentage of the votes cast for the office to which they are elected shall serve for terms of four years, and the candidate receiving the next highest percentage of votes shall serve for a term of two years. If six or more council members are elected, the five candidates receiving the highest percentage of the votes cast for the office to which they are elected shall serve for terms of four years, and the remaining successful candidates receiving the next highest percentage of votes shall serve for terms of two years. Thereafter, all council members shall be elected for terms of four years. Where the term of office for council members under the adopted plan is different from the term of office for council members under an existing form of government, the terms of office for council members so elected shall be established so that, at each subsequent municipal election at which council members are elected, the number of council members to be elected shall be as nearly equal as possible to the number of council members to be elected at every other regular municipal election at which council members are elected. (c) Treasurer, controller, district attorney and sheriff.-- If an elected municipal treasurer or elected municipal controller, elected county district attorney or elected county sheriff is in office at the time of the adoption of an optional plan under the provisions of this subpart, a treasurer, controller, district attorney or sheriff, as the case may be, shall not be elected or appointed to take office until after the resignation, death, removal or expiration of the term of the incumbent in the office. At the expiration of the term of the incumbent, a treasurer, controller, district attorney or sheriff, as the case may be, shall be elected or appointed for the full term for the office as provided by the optional plan adopted. (d) Continuation of existing members of council in office.-- Any member of a municipal governing body in office at the time of the adoption of an optional plan shall remain in office, continuing as an at-large or district council member, as the case may be, until the expiration of this term in office and shall receive the compensation provided by law at that time: (1) If that council member was elected on an at-large basis, the newly adopted optional plan provides for a total number of at-large council members equal to or exceeding the total number of at-large council members under the existing form of government. (2) If that council member was elected on a district basis, the district from which that council member was elected remains unchanged and continues to encompass the exact same geographical area under the newly adopted optional plan as under the existing form of government and the number of council members to be elected from that district under the newly adopted optional plan is equal to or exceeds the number elected from that district under the existing form of government. Any council member may, by writing filed with the municipal treasurer, direct that any portion of his annual compensation for serving in office be returned to the municipal treasury. For the purpose of this section, an executive or mayor who is also a member of the council under an existing plan shall be considered as a member of the council, and, after the new plan goes into effect, his duties shall be only those of a member of council as prescribed by the new plan. (e) Number of members of council to be elected.-- At the municipal election next succeeding the adoption of one of the optional plans provided for in this subpart, the number of council members prescribed by the terms in the plan less the number of council members then in office whose terms do not expire on the first Monday of January next following, as may be determined by subsection (d), shall be elected. (f) Filling vacancies on council existing prior to election.-- If there are vacancies in council occurring by reason of resignation, death or removal 90 days or more before the election, they shall be filled for the remainder of the term of the person originally elected to that office.

(2) The transfer of a power or function to the county from any local municipality within the county, as authorized by the ordinance, shall not become effective for at least 15 months from the date of adoption of the ordinance. (3) Within 120 days from the adoption of the ordinance, the governing body of any local municipality, exercising on the date of the adoption of the ordinance any power or function authorized by ordinance of the county to be exercised by the county, may elect by ordinance to be excluded from the county's exercise of the power or function. Within 60 days after the date of adoption by the governing body of a local municipality of an ordinance excluding the local municipality from the exercise by the county of a power or function or in the absence of any action of the governing body, the qualified electors of the local municipality may initiate a petition requiring that the question of inclusion or exclusion from the exercise of the power or function by the county be submitted to a referendum of the electorate at the election held on the date of the next ensuing primary, municipal or general election not less than 60 days after the filing of the initiative petition with the county board of elections. The initiative and referendum procedures set forth in this subchapter or Subchapter F (relating to general provisions and limitations for optional plan municipalities) shall be followed, except where the same may be inconsistent with any of the provisions of this section. In the event the county determines there is insufficient interest or that it is not feasible to establish the proposed municipal function or power as provided for in the ordinance passed by the county, the county may repeal the county ordinance prior to the effective date of the ordinance. (4) The governing body of any local municipality may by ordinance, subsequent to the time limit for action as set forth in paragraph (3), request the county to be included in a municipal power or function being exercised by the county. However, the county may specify the terms and conditions for acceptance or denial of the power or function requested by the local municipality to be exercised by the county, which shall be subject to court review if the local municipality determines that the terms and conditions as set forth by the county are unreasonable. (5) No assessment, tax, fee or levy in the nature thereof made by the governing body of a county in support of the exercise of a power or function as authorized by ordinance of the county shall be applicable in any local municipality within the county which is providing the same municipal power or function. (6) If the electors of a local municipality by referendum vote to exclude the local municipality from the exercise of a power or function by the county, a petition may not be initiated nor may a referendum be held on the same question more often than every five years thereafter. (7) A local municipality may, by action of the governing body or by initiative and referendum, withdraw from a power or function which it was exercising at the date of the adoption of the county home rule charter which it transferred to a county, provided it again assumes and exercises the power or function, but may not vote on the question of withdrawing sooner than four years from the time the county assumed the power or function of the local municipality.",

(a) General rule.-- Whenever the governing body of a local government unit shall be of the opinion that it has outstanding unfunded debt, it may, by petition to the court of common pleas setting forth the facts, request approval for the issuance of bonds or notes to fund the unfunded debt. After hearing, on such notice to the local government unit and its taxpayers as the court may prescribe, the court shall make an order granting authority to fund all or a part of the unfunded debt if the court finds that the unfunded debt is a lawful obligation of the local government unit; that there has been an unforeseeable decline in revenues or that taxes levied have not produced the revenues anticipated or that it was not reasonable to foresee the obligation; that paying the debt by curtailing municipal services will be dangerous to the public health, safety or education; and that it is not feasible or not in the public interest to levy additional taxes in the current fiscal year. The funding debt so approved shall be stated to mature in the amounts and over the number of years, not exceeding ten, as the court finds will accomplish the payment of the debt without endangering the rendering of municipal services or requiring the levying of excessive taxes. If the funding of the unfunded debt has not been approved by a vote of the electors, the order of the court upon cause shown may fix the portion, if any, which shall not be charged against the nonelectoral debt limitations of the local government unit under sections 8022 (relating to limitations on incurring of other debt) and 8125 (relating to security for tax anticipation notes and sinking fund) during the time the funding debt is outstanding. (b) Issuance and sale of bonds or notes.-- The bonds or notes representing funding debt so authorized by the court shall be issued and sold by the governing body as provided by other provisions of this subpart in respect of general obligation bonds except as these provisions are modified by this section or by orders of the court issued under this section, and the proceedings filed by the local government unit in respect of the funding bonds under section 8201 (relating to certification to department of bond or note transcript or lease, guaranty, subsidy contract or other agreement) shall include certified copies of the petition and of the order of the court.

(2) If desired, the committee may conduct discussions with three or more professionals regarding anticipated design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment. The committee shall select, based upon criteria established by the head of the purchasing agency, no less than three design professionals deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. In exercising its responsibility, the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) An equitable distribution of contracts to design professionals. (ii) Particular capability to perform the design or construction services for the contract being considered. (iii) Geographic proximity of the design professional to the proposed facility. (iv) The design professional selected has the necessary available personnel to perform the services required by the project. (v) Any other relevant circumstances peculiar to the proposed contract. (f) Design professionals.-- Except as provided for in subsection (g), the head of the purchasing agency shall select design professionals as follows: (1) Where the amount of the base construction allocation is less than $20,000,000, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The fee to be paid to the appointed design professional may be established by the selection committee or may be negotiated at the discretion of the head of the purchasing agency. The $20,000,000 threshold shall be adjusted by the department to reflect the annual percentage change in the Composite Construction Cost Index of the United States Department of Commerce occurring in the one-year period ending December 31 each year. (2) Where the amount of base construction allocation is in excess of or equal to $20,000,000, as annually adjusted, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee to begin contract negotiations. The fee to be paid to the design professional and the terms of the contract between the design professional and the department shall be negotiated by the head of the purchasing agency. In negotiating the contract and the fee, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, uniqueness and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the appointed design professional, negotiations with that design professional shall be terminated, and the head of the purchasing agency shall commence negotiations with one of the other firms chosen by the selection committee. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the second firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall terminate negotiations with the second design professional and commence negotiation with the third firm. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall choose additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this subsection until an agreement is reached. (g) Selection method for Department of Transportation, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Protection and State-affiliated entities.-- In the event the Department of Transportation, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection or a State-affiliated entity otherwise authorized by law to use its own selection committee requires the services of a design professional, the head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall negotiate with the firm determined to be the highest qualified firm for design professional services at a fee which is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth. In making this decision, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee he determines to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The head of the purchasing agency shall then undertake negotiations with the firm he determines to be the second highest qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the third highest qualified firm. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the committee shall select additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

(d) Initial apportionment.-- If the referendum on the question results in the approval by the voters to amend the home rule charter or optional plan to provide for the election of the governing body either by districts or partially by districts and partially at large or in a change in the number of members of the governing body, the initial apportionment of the districts shall be made as follows: (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), by an apportionment commission consisting of seven members, all of whom shall reside in the municipality. Two members of the apportionment commission shall be appointed by the mayor.

The seventh member of the commission shall be elected at large by a majority vote of the other six members and shall serve as chairperson of the commission. (2) At the option of a municipality with a mayor, or for a municipality without a mayor, the initial apportionment shall be made by the members of the governing body of the municipality consistent with section 903 (relating to reapportionment by governing body).

(2) The transfer of a power or function to the county from any local municipality within the county, as authorized by the ordinance, shall not become effective for at least 15 months from the date of adoption of the ordinance. (3) Within 120 days from the adoption of the ordinance, the governing body of any local municipality, exercising on the date of the adoption of the ordinance any power or function authorized by ordinance of the county to be exercised by the county, may elect by ordinance to be excluded from the county's exercise of the power or function. Within 60 days after the date of adoption by the governing body of a local municipality of an ordinance excluding the local municipality from the exercise by the county of a power or function or in the absence of any action of the governing body, the qualified electors of the local municipality may initiate a petition requiring that the question of inclusion or exclusion from the exercise of the power or function by the county be submitted to a referendum of the electorate at the election held on the date of the next ensuing primary, municipal or general election not less than 60 days after the filing of the initiative petition with the county board of elections. The initiative and referendum procedures set forth in this subchapter or Subchapter F (relating to general provisions and limitations for optional plan municipalities) shall be followed, except where the same may be inconsistent with any of the provisions of this section. In the event the county determines there is insufficient interest or that it is not feasible to establish the proposed municipal function or power as provided for in the ordinance passed by the county, the county may repeal the county ordinance prior to the effective date of the ordinance. (4) The governing body of any local municipality may by ordinance, subsequent to the time limit for action as set forth in paragraph (3), request the county to be included in a municipal power or function being exercised by the county. However, the county may specify the terms and conditions for acceptance or denial of the power or function requested by the local municipality to be exercised by the county, which shall be subject to court review if the local municipality determines that the terms and conditions as set forth by the county are unreasonable. (5) No assessment, tax, fee or levy in the nature thereof made by the governing body of a county in support of the exercise of a power or function as authorized by ordinance of the county shall be applicable in any local municipality within the county which is providing the same municipal power or function. (6) If the electors of a local municipality by referendum vote to exclude the local municipality from the exercise of a power or function by the county, a petition may not be initiated nor may a referendum be held on the same question more often than every five years thereafter. (7) A local municipality may, by action of the governing body or by initiative and referendum, withdraw from a power or function which it was exercising at the date of the adoption of the county home rule charter which it transferred to a county, provided it again assumes and exercises the power or function, but may not vote on the question of withdrawing sooner than four years from the time the county assumed the power or function of the local municipality.",

(2) Maintain universal telecommunications service at affordable rates while encouraging the accelerated provision of advanced services and deployment of a universally available, state-of-the-art, interactive broadband telecommunications network in rural, suburban and urban areas, including deployment of broadband facilities in or adjacent to public rights-of-way abutting public schools, including the administrative offices supporting public schools, industrial parks and health care facilities. (3) Ensure that customers pay only reasonable charges for protected services which shall be available on a nondiscriminatory basis. (4) Ensure that rates for protected services do not subsidize the competitive ventures of telecommunications carriers. (5) Provide diversity in the supply of existing and future telecommunications services and products in telecommunications markets throughout this Commonwealth by ensuring that rates, terms and conditions for protected services are reasonable and do not impede the development of competition. (6) Ensure the efficient delivery of technological advances and new services throughout this Commonwealth in order to improve the quality of life for all Commonwealth residents. (7) Encourage the provision of telecommunications products and services that enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. (8) Promote and encourage the provision of competitive services by a variety of service providers on equal terms throughout all geographic areas of this Commonwealth without jeopardizing the provision of universal telecommunications service at affordable rates.

(10) Encourage joint ventures between local exchange telecommunications companies and other entities where such joint ventures accelerate, improve or otherwise assist a local exchange telecommunications company in implementing its network modernization plan. (11) Establish a bona fide retail request program to aggregate and make advanced services available in areas where sufficient market demand exists and to supplement existing network modernization plans. (12) Promote and encourage the provision of advanced services and broadband deployment in the service territories of local exchange telecommunications companies without jeopardizing the provision of universal service. (13) Recognize that the regulatory obligations imposed upon the incumbent local exchange telecommunications companies should be reduced to levels more consistent with those imposed upon competing alternative service providers.

(4) When a bona fide retail request has been received that meets the requirements of paragraph (2), the local exchange telecommunications company shall provide the requested advanced service, or other reasonably comparable service having a bandwidth within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of the requested service, to the community as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 365 days of the date the requirements of paragraph (2) have been met or within the period approved by the commission under paragraph (5) or (6) where: (i) the local exchange telecommunications company provides the requested advanced service to other customers in its service territory; (ii) no service is available to the requesting customers from an alternative service provider at or within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of the data speed requested or such service is available at a price that exceeds the then current price offered by the local exchange telecommunications company by more than 50%; (iii) the community is situated within the service territory of the local exchange telecommunications company; and (iv) the local exchange telecommunications company does not have to provide fiber to the customer's premises to furnish the requested advanced service. (5) Where, as a result of property acquisition, including acquiring rights-of-way, or new construction, a local exchange telecommunications company is unable to provide the requested advanced service within the one-year period set forth in paragraph (4), the company may petition the commission for an extension of up to six months, with service upon the customer or customers who made the bona fide retail request and the department if the department submitted the request on behalf of the customer or customers. The commission may delegate its authority to rule on such petitions to a bureau director or other appropriate employee who shall grant the petition for good cause shown. (6) Where the total number of bona fide retail requests received by any local exchange telecommunications company or affiliated companies that meet the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4) exceed 40 requests in any 12-month period or where there are more than 20 such requests that require property acquisition, including acquiring rights-of-way, or new construction in any 12-month period, the local exchange telecommunications company or companies may provide a verified certification to the commission that one or both of the previously stated criteria are met, with service upon the customer or customers who made the additional requests and upon the department if the department submitted any such requests. Upon receipt of the certification, the commission or the commission through its designated staff shall permit the local exchange telecommunications company or companies to extend the time for such deployments for a period of no more than 12 months unless the commission determines an additional time period to be just and reasonable. If a deployment is extended, it shall be counted in determining the maximum number of deployments provided for under this subsection in any 12-month period covering the month to which it is extended. (7) No advanced service requested and deployed by a local exchange telecommunications company under the bona fide retail request program which has a bandwidth of less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) in the downstream direction shall be counted as a credit toward the local exchange telecommunications company's broadband deployment obligation under its network modernization plan amended pursuant to subsection (b)(2) or (3). (8) With regard to requests submitted under this subsection, a retail customer may challenge the action of a local exchange telecommunications company pursuant to section 701 (relating to complaints). (9) Local exchange telecommunications companies with bona fide retail request programs shall provide semiannual reports to the commission and the department of the number of requests for advanced services received during the reporting period by exchange or density cell and the action taken on requests meeting the requirements of this subsection. (10) A local exchange telecommunication company's bona fide retail request program established under this subsection shall continue through December 31, 2015, or such earlier date as the local exchange telecommunications company achieves 100% broadband availability throughout its service territory. (11) In addition to adjudicating any complaints brought by customers under paragraph (8), the commission shall monitor and enforce the compliance of participating local exchange telecommunications companies with their obligations under this subsection. (d) Business attraction or retention program.-- (1) Not later than 90 days after amending its network modernization plan under subsection (b)(2) or (3), the local exchange telecommunications company shall establish a business attraction or retention program to permit the department to aggregate customer demand where necessary and facilitate the deployment of advanced or broadband services to qualifying businesses which the department seeks to attract to or retain in this Commonwealth and whose requests for such services are submitted by or through the department. (2) Each local exchange telecommunications company which amends its network modernization plan under subsection (b)(2) or (3) not later than 90 days after the effective date of its amended plan shall designate a single point of contact to receive all written advanced or broadband service requests forwarded by the department, provide associated contact information to the department and provide the department and the commission with a written description of its participation in the program and a sample request for advanced or broadband services form for use in the program. (3) The department may submit a request to the applicable local exchange telecommunications company by or on behalf of qualifying businesses in areas that the department deems priority areas for economic development, including and giving preference to keystone opportunity zones, keystone opportunity expansion zones, enterprise zones, keystone opportunity improvement zones and other areas identified by the department as lacking adequate access to advanced or broadband services which would be important in order to promote economic development projects in those areas. (4) The department shall establish an advisory committee that shall consist of representatives of each local exchange telecommunications company with a business attraction or retention program, local development districts and other local economic and industrial development agencies to assist the department in developing protocols and procedures for implementing these programs pursuant to this subsection. (5) Qualifying business or businesses' requests for advanced services submitted by the department that are provisioned through the bona fide retail request program shall be processed in accordance with subsection (c) and shall be allocated 50% of the maximum number of annual deployments referenced in subsection (c)(6). Other requests shall be allocated 50% of the number of such deployments, provided, however, that any allocated deployments that are unused may be utilized by the department or nondepartment applicants, as applicable. (6) For qualifying business or businesses whose request for advanced services is determined by the local exchange telecommunications company to be better processed outside of the bona fide retail request program, the local exchange telecommunications company shall make a proposal to the requesting business or businesses to provide the requested advanced or broadband service and subsequently shall provision such service. The local exchange telecommunications company shall advise the department and the business or businesses within 30 days of the date the contract is signed of the date by which the requested advanced or broadband service will be provided, which date shall be not later than one year after the date the contract is signed unless the business or businesses agree to a longer period or the local exchange telecommunications company obtains commission approval of an extension under the same procedure set forth in subsection (c)(5). (7) No advanced service requested of and deployed by a local exchange telecommunications company under the Business Attraction or Retention Program which has a bandwidth of less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) in the downstream direction shall be counted as a credit toward the local exchange telecommunication company's broadband deployment obligation under its network modernization plan amended under subsection (b)(2) or (3). (8) Each local exchange telecommunications company which is required to participate in the department's Business Attraction or Retention Program shall continue its participation through December 31, 2015, or such earlier date as it achieves 100% broadband availability throughout its service territory. (9) The department shall oversee local exchange telecommunications company participation in the Business Attraction or Retention Program, including the timely completion of qualifying advanced or broadband services requests submitted by or through the department which are processed within or outside of the participating local exchange telecommunications companies' bona fide retail request programs. (10) The commission shall monitor and enforce the compliance of participating local exchange telecommunications companies with their obligations under the Business Attraction or Retention Program. (e) Notice of filing of amendments.-- A local exchange telecommunications company that elects to amend its network modernization plan under subsection (b) shall notify the commission in writing of such election and, within 60 days following such notification, file its amended network modernization plan with the commission. Copies of the written notice of election and of the amended network modernization plan shall be served by the local exchange telecommunications company on the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate. Concurrent with the filing of the amended plan with the commission, the local exchange telecommunications company shall publish notice of such filing in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in its service territory or by bill message or insert. An amended plan compliant with the requirements of this chapter shall be approved by the commission within 100 days of its filing. If the commission fails to act within 100 days, the amended plan shall be deemed approved. (f) Network modernization plan report.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company operating under a network modernization plan shall continue to file with the commission biennial reports on its provision of broadband availability in the form and detail required by the commission as of July 1, 2004, unless such reporting requirements are subsequently reduced by the commission. (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impede the ability of the commission to require the submission of further information to support the accuracy of or to seek an explanation of the reports specified in this subsection. (3) Under no circumstances shall the commission compel the public release of maps or other information describing the actual location of a local exchange telecommunications company's facilities. (g) Assistance to political subdivisions.-- A local exchange telecommunications company shall commit in its amended network modernization plan to make technical assistance available to political subdivisions located in its service territory in pursuing the deployment of additional telecommunications infrastructure or services by the local exchange telecommunications company. (h) Prohibition against political subdivision advanced and broadband services deployment.-- (1) Except as otherwise provided for under paragraph (2), a political subdivision or any entity established by a political subdivision may not provide to the public for compensation any telecommunications services, including advanced and broadband services, within the service territory of a local exchange telecommunications company operating under a network modernization plan. (2) A political subdivision may offer advanced or broadband services if the political subdivision has submitted a written request for the deployment of such service to the local exchange telecommunications company serving the area and, within two months of receipt of the request, the local exchange telecommunications company or one of its affiliates has not agreed to provide the data speeds requested. If the local exchange telecommunications company or one of its affiliates agrees to provide the data speeds requested, then it must do so within 14 months of receipt of the request. (3) The prohibition in paragraph (1) shall not be construed to preclude the continued provision or offering of telecommunications services by a political subdivision of the same type and scope as were being provided on the effective date of this section. (i) Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Program.-- (1) The department shall establish a Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Program for the purpose of making expenditures and providing grants from the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund established under section 3015(c) (relating to alternative forms of regulation) for: (i) Outreach programs for political subdivisions, economic development entities, schools, health care facilities, businesses and residential customers concerning the benefits, use and procurement of broadband services; and (ii) Seed grants to aggregate customer demand for broadband services in communities or political subdivisions with limited access to such services and to permit customers in such communities or political subdivisions to request such services from a telecommunications provider. (2) The department shall annually report to the commission on all payments to and expenditures from the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund, and the commission shall verify the accuracy of the contributions from the participating local exchange telecommunications companies. (j) Education Technology Program.-- (1) The Department of Education shall establish an Education Technology Program for the purpose of providing grants to school entities from the Education Technology Fund (E-Fund) established under section 3015(d).

(4) No later than 90 days after the effective date of this section, the Department of Education shall prescribe the grant process and the form and manner of the E-Fund application. Grants shall be limited to the funds available in the Education Technology Fund. In awarding grants, the Department of Education shall give priority to applications: (i) that are submitted by school entities that seek funds for discounted broadband services under subsection (l) or for broadband infrastructure, facilities or equipment from local exchange telecommunications companies which contribute to the E-Fund; (ii) that seek funds for regional networks that serve multiple school districts which are filed on behalf of multiple school districts and school entities; or (iii) that are submitted by school entities that do not have broadband service, provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall preclude the department from awarding funds to school entities for telecommunications services, infrastructure or facilities that provide bandwidths greater than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps). The Department of Education shall assure that the applications funded each year are geographically dispersed throughout the Commonwealth. (k) Balanced deployment.-- A local exchange telecommunications company shall reasonably balance deployment of its broadband network between rural, urban and suburban areas within its service territory, as those areas are applicable, in accordance with its approved network modernization plan. (l) Broadband discounts to schools.-- Each local exchange telecommunications company that elects to amend its network modernization plan pursuant to this section: (1) Shall offer school customers which meet the eligibility standards described in 47 CFR 54.501 (relating to eligibility for services provided by telecommunications carriers) and which agree to enter into a minimum three-year contract a 30% discount, or greater discount at the local exchange telecommunications company's discretion, in the otherwise applicable tariffed distance-sensitive per-mile rate element and also will waive the associated nonrecurring charges for available intrastate broadband services where used for educational purposes and not for the provision of telecommunications services to the public for compensation. The discount or waiver shall not be required where application of it to a particular service would conflict with applicable law.

      "text": "§ 3015. Alternative forms of regulation. (a) Inflation offset.-- (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a local exchange telecommunications company with an alternative form of regulation containing a price stability mechanism that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1), (2) or (3) (relating to network modernization plans) shall be subject to a modified inflation offset in its price stability mechanism in adjusting its rates for noncompetitive services, effective upon the filing of an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(e), as follows: (i) If a nonrural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2013, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be zero. (ii) If a nonrural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2015, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be equal to 0.5%. (iii) If a rural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2008, or under section 3014(b)(2)(ii)(A) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2013, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be zero. (iv) If a rural telecommunications carrier files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(2)(ii)(B) that commits to deploy 100% broadband availability by December 31, 2015, then the carrier's inflation offset shall be equal to 0.5%. (2) Utilizing network modernization plan reports filed with the commission by local exchange telecommunications companies under section 3014(f), the commission shall monitor and enforce companies' compliance with their interim and final 100% commitments for broadband availability in their amended network modernization plans. In the event that a local exchange telecommunications company is found by the commission, after notice and evidentiary hearings held on an expedited basis, to have failed to meet such an interim or final 100% commitment, then the commission shall require the local exchange telecommunications company to refund to customers in its next price stability filing an amount that is just and reasonable under the circumstances. Such amount shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the percentage shortfall of the broadband availability commitment on an access-line basis required to be met during the period from the start of the amended plan or from the date of the last prior interim commitment, as applicable, times the increased revenue that was obtained during this period as a result of the modified inflation offset provided in this section that reduced the inflation offset applicable in the local exchange telecommunications company's alternative regulation plan in effect on the effective date of this section, plus interest calculated under section 1308(d) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). Any such refund required under this subsection shall be separate from and in addition to any civil or other penalties that the commission may impose on a local exchange telecommunications company under Chapter 33 (relating to violations and penalties). (3) Where annual rate adjustments made under a nonrural telecommunications carrier's price stability mechanism are calculated using revenues from protected services, an average rate adjustment for protected residential customer local exchange telecommunications service lines shall be determined by dividing the total protected service revenues associated with such lines, as adjusted by the price stability formula, by the number of such lines, and the rate adjustment for any individual line shall not vary from this average rate adjustment by more than 20%. (b) Rate changes for rural telecommunications carriers.-- (1) In addition to the rate change provisions in its alternative form of regulation plan, a rural telecommunications carrier operating without a price stability mechanism that files with the commission an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1) or (2) shall be permitted at any time to file proposed tariff changes with the commission, effective 45 days after filing, setting forth miscellaneous changes, including increases and decreases, in rates for noncompetitive services, excluding basic residential and business rates, provided such rate changes do not increase the rural telecommunications carrier's annual intrastate revenues by more than 3%. (2) The commission tariff filing requirements and review associated with such proposed rate changes shall be limited to schedules submitted by the rural telecommunications carrier detailing the impact of the rate changes on the carrier's annual intrastate revenues. (3) A rural telecommunications carrier that implements noncompetitive rate changes consistent with the procedure set forth in its alternative form of regulation plan shall be required only to file such financial and cost data with the commission to justify such changes as is required under its commission-approved alternative form of regulation plan. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), (2) or (3), for any rural telecommunications carrier serving less than 50,000 access lines in this Commonwealth and operating under an alternative form of regulation plan, a formal complaint to deny rate changes for noncompetitive services unless signed by at least 20 customers of the rural telecommunications carrier shall not prevent implementation of the rate changes pending the adjudication of the formal complaint by the commission. (c) Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund.-- (1) There is hereby established within the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund for the purposes enumerated in section 3014(i). (2) A local exchange telecommunications company that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(2) or (3) shall be assessed by the commission for contribution to the fund and to the E-fund established under subsection (d) an amount of 20% of the first year's annual revenue effect: (i) of any rate increase permitted by the elimination or reduction of the offset under subsection (a) and placed into effect; or (ii) of any rate increase placed into effect under subsection (b)(1) if the local exchange telecommunications company is operating without a price stability mechanism. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"first year's annual revenue effect\" means the projected or actual increased revenues received by the local exchange telecommunications company during the one-year period from the effective date of its rate increase. The commission shall begin the assessments provided for in this paragraph on June 30, 2005, and thereafter shall make such assessments annually on June 30 until June 30, 2010, for assessments that include amounts for the fund and the e-fund and until June 30, 2015, for assessments that include amounts for only the fund. Each assessment shall be based on the first year's annual revenue effect of any covered rate increase effective after the date of the last annual assessment. (3) An amount not to exceed 50% of such assessment shall be allocated to the fund. The remainder of the assessment shall be allocated to the E-fund provided for under subsection (d) until its termination on June 30, 2011. After the E-fund termination, the maximum assessment percentage shall be reduced from 20% to 10%, and contributions shall be made only to the fund until the local exchange telecommunications company achieves 100% broadband availability. Contributions of allocated amounts shall be paid to the fund and the E-fund by the local exchange telecommunications company in equal quarterly installments. (4) In no event shall the total amount of the fund exceed $5,000,000 annually, and in the event of such overfunding the department shall credit the overcollection to the next year's contribution amount. (5) A local exchange telecommunications company that elects to amend its network modernization plan pursuant to section 3014 (b)(1) shall not be required to contribute to the fund. (6) The moneys in the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund are hereby appropriated upon approval of the Governor to the department for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (1). The department may use up to 3% of the money in the fund for administration. (7) The fund shall continue until July 1, 2016, at which time the fund shall terminate, and the department shall return any funds remaining in the fund on a pro rata basis to the local exchange telecommunications companies that contributed to the fund. (d) Education Technology Fund (E-Fund).-- (1) There is hereby established within the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Education Technology Fund (E-Fund) for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (4). (2) All E-fund assessments imposed by the commission under subsection (c)(2) and paragraph (3), moneys specifically appropriated by the General Assembly for the purposes of this subsection and any funds, contributions or payments which may be made available to the fund by the Federal Government, another State agency or any public or private source for the purpose of implementing this subsection shall be deposited in the E-Fund. (3) Beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, the commission shall, no later than June 30, annually assess each nonrural telecommunications carrier that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) an amount to be deposited in the E-Fund. Each carrier's annual assessment shall be payable in two equal installments due on October 31 of each year and January 31 of the following year and shall be based on the relative proportion of the retail access lines served by the nonrural telecommunications carrier in relation to the number of retail access lines served by all nonrural telecommunications carriers that have filed an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3). For fiscal years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, the total annual assessment amount shall be $7,000,000. For fiscal years 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, the total annual assessment amount shall be the difference between $7,000,000 and any amount remaining in the E-Fund from prior fiscal years which remains unencumbered or unexpended. A nonrural telecommunications carrier's assessments required under this paragraph may not be recovered via a surcharge on customers' bills or in rates for noncompetitive services as exogenous change adjustment under the provisions of the carrier's price stability mechanism and subsection (a)(3) where applicable. (4) Additional local exchange telecommunications company contributions to the E-fund shall be made pursuant to the provisions of subsections (c)(2) and (3). (5) The Department of Education shall expend the moneys of the E-Fund for the purpose of providing grants to school entities as prescribed by section 3014(j). (6) The moneys of the Education Technology Fund are hereby appropriated upon approval of the Governor to the Department of Education for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (5). The Department of Education may use up to 3% of the money for administration. Appropriations by the General Assembly to the fund shall be continuing appropriations and shall not lapse at the close of any fiscal year. (7) The E-Fund shall continue until June 30, 2011, at which time the fund shall terminate and the Department of Education shall return any funds remaining therein on a pro rata basis to the local exchange telecommunications companies that contributed to the fund. (e) General filing requirements.-- The commission's filing and audit requirements for a local exchange telecommunications company that is operating under an amended network modernization plan shall be limited to the following: (1) Network modernization plan reports filed pursuant to section 3014(f). (2) An annual financial report consisting of a balance sheet and income statement. (3) An annual deaf, speech-impaired and hearing-impaired relay information report. (4) An annual service report. (5) Universal service reports. (6) An annual access line report. (7) An annual statement of gross intrastate operating revenues for purposes of calculating assessments for regulatory expenses. (8) An annual State tax adjustment computation for years in which a tax change has occurred, if applicable. (9) For those companies with a bona fide retail request program, a bona fide retail request report under section 3014(c)(9). These reports shall be submitted in the form determined by the commission. (f) Other reports.-- (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title to the contrary, no report, statement, filing or other document or information, except as specified in subsection (e), shall be required of any local exchange telecommunications company unless the commission, upon notice to the affected local exchange telecommunications company and an opportunity to be heard, has first made specific written findings supporting conclusions in an entered order that: (i) The report is necessary to ensure that the local exchange telecommunications company is charging rates that are in compliance with this chapter and its effective alternative form of regulation. (ii) The benefits of the report substantially outweigh the attendant expense and administrative time and effort required of the local exchange telecommunications company to prepare it. (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impede the ability of the commission to require the submission of further information to support the accuracy of or to seek an explanation of the reports specified in subsection (e). (g) Rate change limitations.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the requirement of section 1301 (relating to rates to be just and reasonable) that rates shall be just and reasonable. The annual rate change limitations set forth in a local exchange telecommunications company's effective commission-approved alternative form of regulation plan or any other commission-approved annual rate change limitation shall remain applicable and shall be deemed just and reasonable under section 1301. (h) Conformance of plan.-- Upon approval of a local exchange telecommunications company of network modernization plan amendments pursuant to section 3014(e), the local exchange telecommunications company's alternative form of regulation plan shall be deemed amended consistent with this section.

(a) Commission determination of protected, retail nonprotected and retail noncompetitive services as competitive.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company may petition the commission for a determination of whether a protected or retail noncompetitive service or other business activity in its service territory or a particular geographic area, exchange or group of exchanges or density cell within its service territory is competitive based on the demonstrated availability of like or substitute services or other business activities provided or offered by alternative service providers. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall enter an order granting or denying the petition within 60 days of the filing date or within 150 days of the filing date where a protest is timely filed, or the petition shall be deemed granted. (2) The local exchange telecommunications company shall serve a copy of its petition on the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission. (3) In making its determination, the commission shall consider all relevant information submitted to it, including the availability of like or substitute services or other business activities, and shall limit its determination to the service territory or the particular geographic area, exchange or group of exchanges or density cell in which the service or other business activity has been proved to be competitive. (4) The burden of proving that a protected or retail noncompetitive service or other business activity is competitive rests on the local exchange telecommunications company. (b) Declaration of retail nonprotected services as competitive.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), a local exchange telecommunications company may declare any retail nonprotected service as competitive by filing its declaration with the commission and serving it on the Office of Consumer Advocate, Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission, provided that a local exchange telecommunications company may not use this declaration process for any service that the commission previously has reclassified as noncompetitive under either subsection (c) or prior law. A declaration of a retail nonprotected service as competitive shall be effective upon filing by the local exchange telecommunications company with the commission. (c) Reclassification.-- (1) A party may petition the commission for a determination of whether a service or other business activity previously determined or declared to be competitive is noncompetitive. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall enter an order deciding the petition within 60 days of the filing date or 90 days of the filing date where a protest is timely filed, or the petition shall be approved. (2) The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition on the affected local exchange telecommunications company if the petitioner is not the company, the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission. (3) In making its determination, the commission shall consider all relevant information submitted to it, including the availability of like or substitute services or other business activities, and shall limit its determination to the particular geographic area, exchange or density cell in which the service or other business activity has been proved to be noncompetitive. (4) The burden of proving that a competitive service or other business activity should be reclassified as noncompetitive rests on the party seeking the reclassification. (5) If the commission reclassifies a service or other business activity as noncompetitive, the commission shall determine a just and reasonable rate for the reclassified service or business activity in accordance with section 1301 (relating to rates to be just and reasonable). (d) Additional requirements.-- (1) The prices which a local exchange telecommunications company charges for competitive services shall not be less than the costs to provide the services. (2) The commission may not require tariffs for competitive service offerings to be filed with the commission. (3) A local exchange telecommunications company at its option may tariff its rates subject to rules and regulations applicable to the provision of competitive services. (4) The commission may require a local exchange telecommunications company to maintain price lists with the commission applicable to its competitive services. Price changes that are filed in a company's tariff for competitive services will go into effect on a one-day notice. (e) Pricing flexibility and bundling.-- (1) Subject to the requirements of subsection (d)(1), a local exchange telecommunications company may price competitive services at the company's discretion. (2) A local exchange telecommunications company may offer and bill to customers on one bill bundled packages of services which include nontariffed, competitive, noncompetitive or protected services, including services of an affiliate, in combinations and at a single price selected by the company. A local exchange telecommunications company may file an informational tariff for a bundled package effective on a one-day notice. (3) When an alternative service provider is offering local exchange telecommunications services within an exchange of a rural telecommunications carrier, the rural telecommunications carrier may reduce its prices on services offered within the exchange below the rates set forth in its otherwise applicable tariff in order to meet such competition. A rural telecommunications carrier may not offset revenue reductions resulting from such competitive pricing by increasing rates charged to other customers through its price stability mechanism or otherwise. (f) Prohibitions.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company shall be prohibited from using revenues earned or expenses incurred in conjunction with noncompetitive services to subsidize competitive services. (2) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prevent the marketing and billing of packages containing both noncompetitive and competitive services to customers.

      "text": "§ 3162. Status and term of office of officials. (a) Existing elected official.-- Any elected municipal official in office at the time of the adoption of any optional plan provided by this subpart shall continue in office only until the new plan of government goes into effect as provided in section 3161 (relating to applicability of plan), except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d). (b) Members of council.-- At the municipal election next succeeding the adoption of one of the optional plans provided for in this subpart, if four or fewer council members are elected, they shall serve for terms of four years. If five are elected, the four successful candidates receiving the highest percentage of the votes cast for the office to which they are elected shall serve for terms of four years, and the candidate receiving the next highest percentage of votes shall serve for a term of two years. If six or more council members are elected, the five candidates receiving the highest percentage of the votes cast for the office to which they are elected shall serve for terms of four years, and the remaining successful candidates receiving the next highest percentage of votes shall serve for terms of two years. Thereafter, all council members shall be elected for terms of four years. Where the term of office for council members under the adopted plan is different from the term of office for council members under an existing form of government, the terms of office for council members so elected shall be established so that, at each subsequent municipal election at which council members are elected, the number of council members to be elected shall be as nearly equal as possible to the number of council members to be elected at every other regular municipal election at which council members are elected. (c) Treasurer, controller, district attorney and sheriff.-- If an elected municipal treasurer or elected municipal controller, elected county district attorney or elected county sheriff is in office at the time of the adoption of an optional plan under the provisions of this subpart, a treasurer, controller, district attorney or sheriff, as the case may be, shall not be elected or appointed to take office until after the resignation, death, removal or expiration of the term of the incumbent in the office. At the expiration of the term of the incumbent, a treasurer, controller, district attorney or sheriff, as the case may be, shall be elected or appointed for the full term for the office as provided by the optional plan adopted. (d) Continuation of existing members of council in office.-- Any member of a municipal governing body in office at the time of the adoption of an optional plan shall remain in office, continuing as an at-large or district council member, as the case may be, until the expiration of this term in office and shall receive the compensation provided by law at that time: (1) If that council member was elected on an at-large basis, the newly adopted optional plan provides for a total number of at-large council members equal to or exceeding the total number of at-large council members under the existing form of government. (2) If that council member was elected on a district basis, the district from which that council member was elected remains unchanged and continues to encompass the exact same geographical area under the newly adopted optional plan as under the existing form of government and the number of council members to be elected from that district under the newly adopted optional plan is equal to or exceeds the number elected from that district under the existing form of government. Any council member may, by writing filed with the municipal treasurer, direct that any portion of his annual compensation for serving in office be returned to the municipal treasury. For the purpose of this section, an executive or mayor who is also a member of the council under an existing plan shall be considered as a member of the council, and, after the new plan goes into effect, his duties shall be only those of a member of council as prescribed by the new plan. (e) Number of members of council to be elected.-- At the municipal election next succeeding the adoption of one of the optional plans provided for in this subpart, the number of council members prescribed by the terms in the plan less the number of council members then in office whose terms do not expire on the first Monday of January next following, as may be determined by subsection (d), shall be elected. (f) Filling vacancies on council existing prior to election.-- If there are vacancies in council occurring by reason of resignation, death or removal 90 days or more before the election, they shall be filled for the remainder of the term of the person originally elected to that office.

(a) Method.-- The total cost of the administrative services or improvements in the district shall be assessed to all of the benefited properties in the district by one of the following methods: (1) By an assessment determined by multiplying the total service and improvement cost by the ratio of the assessed value of the benefited property to the total assessed valuation of all benefited properties in the district. (2) By an assessment upon the several properties in the district in proportion to benefits as ascertained by viewers appointed in accordance with law. (3) In the case of improvements by an assessment upon the several properties in the district abutting the improvements or benefiting from the services, or, where more than one type of improvement or service is involved, designated types, by the front-foot method, with equitable adjustments for corner properties and other cases provided for in the assessment ordinance. Any property which cannot be equitably assessed by the front-foot method may be assessed by the method provided in paragraph (2). (b) Payment.-- The governing body may by ordinance authorize the payment of the assessment in equal annual or more frequent installments over such time and bearing interest at the rate specified in the ordinance. If bonds have been issued and sold, or notes or guarantees have been given or issued, to provide for the cost of the services and improvements, the assessment in equal installments shall not be payable beyond the term for which the bonds, notes or guarantees are payable. (c) Claims to secure assessments.-- Claims to secure the assessments shall be entered in the prothonotary's office at the time and in the form and shall be collected in the manner that municipal claims are filed and collected. If installment payments are authorized pursuant to subsection (b), the ordinance may contain any or all of the following provisions: (1) Notwithstanding the filing of the claims, all assessments which are made payable in installments shall constitute liens and encumbrances upon the respective benefited properties, at the beginning of each calendar year, except as provided in paragraph (2), only in an amount equal to the sum of: (i) the annual or other installments becoming payable in such year, with interest and penalties, if any, thereon; and (ii) the total of all installments, with interest and penalties thereon, which became due during prior years and which remain due and unpaid at the beginning of the current year. (2) In the case of default in the payment of any installment and interest for a period of 90 days after the payment becomes due, the assessment ordinance may provide either for the entire assessment, with accrued interest and penalties to become due and become a lien from the due date of the installment, or may provide solely for the enforcement of the claim as to the overdue installment, with interest and penalties, in which case the ordinance shall further provide that, if any installment or portion thereof remains due and unpaid for one year after it has become due and payable, then the entire assessment with accrued interest and penalties shall become due and become a lien from the due date of the installment. (3) No action taken to enforce a claim for any installment or installments shall affect the status of any subsequent installment of the same assessment, each of which shall continue to become a lien upon the property annually pursuant to paragraph (1). (4) The ordinance may contain any other provision relating to installment assessments which is not inconsistent with applicable law. (d) Payment in full.-- Any owner of property against whom an assessment has been made may pay the assessment in full, at any time, with accrued interest and costs thereon, and such a payment shall discharge the lien of the assessment, or installments then constituting a lien, and shall also release the claim to any later installments. (e) Benefits from administrative services.-- No residential property shall be assessed under this chapter for any benefit received from administrative services.

The action shall be brought and tried as an action in equity in the court of common pleas of the county in which the adult-oriented establishment is located.

No bond shall be required in instituting such proceedings.

(2) It shall not be necessary for the court to find the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but, on finding that the material allegations of the petition are true, the court shall order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises be used in violation of this chapter. Upon judgment of the court ordering the violations to be abated, the court may order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises shall be occupied or used for any purpose for up to one year following the date of the court's order, but the court may, in its discretion, permit the premises to be occupied or used by the operator or owner if the operator or owner, or both, posts a bond or a joint bond in the discretion of the court with sufficient surety to be approved by the court in the penal and liquidated sum of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and conditioned that neither the building nor a part of the building be used in violation of this chapter and that the operator will pay all fines, costs and damages that may be assessed for any violation of this chapter upon the premises. (3) Service of any preliminary or permanent injunction shall be made personally upon the operator and owner of the premises if such persons can be found in the county. If the operator or owner cannot be found, a copy of the order shall be delivered to any employee of the operator on the establishment premises or, in the case of the owner, upon an agent, if any. If no employee or agent can be found or service cannot be made on an employee or agent of the owner, then service shall be made as the court may direct.

Suspension by Court Order. Subsec. (b)(1) was suspended July 31, 1997, S.Ct.

(c) Accrued liability contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2003, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits, except for the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708 (relating to supplemental annuities), 5708.1 (relating to additional supplemental annuities), 5708.2 (relating to further additional supplemental annuities), 5708.3 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1994), 5708.4 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment), 5708.5 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1998), 5708.6 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2002), 5708.7 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2003) and 5708.8 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002), in excess of the total assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all investment gains and losses over a five-year period), excluding the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members on December 31, 2001, and excluding contributions to be transferred by county retirement systems or pension plans pursuant to section 5507(c) (relating to contributions to the system by the Commonwealth and other employers). The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002, except that, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2002, but before July 1, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded over a period of ten years from the first day of July, coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution for such additional legislative liabilities shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the first annual payment. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, the outstanding balance of the increase in accrued liability due to the change in benefits enacted in 2001 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2002, and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in calendar year 2002 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2003. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2003, but before January 1, 2009, such additional liability shall be funded in equal dollar annual contributions over a period of ten years from the first day of July coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. (3) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund in equal dollar installments over a period of 30 years from July 1, 2010, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits calculated as of the immediately prior valuation date, including the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8, but excluding the benefits payable from the retirement benefit plan established pursuant to section 5941 (relating to benefits completion plan), in excess of the actuarially calculated assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses each year in level annual installments over five years), including the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer will receive for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members, inactive members on leave without pay, vestees and special vestees on December 31, 2009. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (4) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as provided for under this section, except that the rate shall be computed as a rate of total compensation of all active members and active participants for the applicable period and the accrued liability shall be determined and the rate shall be computed without regard to the portion of any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h) for which an annual setoff has not been credited or recognized in a prior fiscal year. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2016, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. In addition to any employer defined contributions made to the trust, the Commonwealth and other employers of participants shall make the accrued liability contributions to the fund certified by the board. (d) Special provisions on calculating contributions.-- In calculating the contributions required by subsections (a), (b) and (c), the active members of Class C shall be considered to be members of Class A. In addition, the actuary shall determine the Commonwealth or other employer contributions required for active members of Class C and officers of the Pennsylvania State Police and enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board who are members of Class A to finance their benefits in excess of those to which other members of Class A are entitled. Such additional contributions shall be determined separately for officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police and for enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. Such contributions payable on behalf of officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police shall include the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of May 12, 1943 (P.L.259, No.120), referred to as the Foreign Casualty Insurance Premium Tax Allocation Law, and on behalf of enforcement officers or investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of April 12, 1951 (P.L.90, No.21), known as the Liquor Code. (e) Supplemental annuity contribution rate.-- (1) For the period July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4 and 5708.5 shall be paid over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002. The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2002 provided for in section 5708.6 shall be as provided in section 5708.6(f). The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2003 provided for in section 5708.7 shall be as provided in section 5708.7(f). The funding for the special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002 under section 5708.8 shall be as provided in section 5708.8(g). The amount of each annual supplemental annuities contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002. (2) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8 shall be paid as part of the accrued liability contribution rate as provided for in subsection (c)(3), and there shall not be a separate supplemental annuity contribution rate attributable to those supplemental annuities. In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (f) Experience adjustment factor.-- (1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability and any increase or decrease in the liabilities and funding for supplemental annuities, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience (recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses over a five-year period), changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, State employees making shared-risk member contributions or having shared-gain adjustments to their regular member contributions, payment of additional accrued liability contributions under section 5507(g), changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of 30 years beginning with the July 1 succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases. The experience adjustment factor calculated under this paragraph shall be determined without regard to any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h). (2) The actuarially required contribution rate shall be the sum of the normal contribution rate, the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate, modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in paragraph (1). (g) Determination of liability for special vestee.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or other law, the total additional accrued actuarial liability resulting from eligibility of special vestees for benefits upon the attainment of superannuation age shall be determined by the actuary as part of the first annual valuation made after June 30, 1997. The resulting additional accrued actuarial liability shall be paid by The Pennsylvania State University to the board in one lump sum payment within 90 days of the board's certification of the amount to The Pennsylvania State University. (h) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.-- The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation to the prior year's final contribution rate. If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by the respective percentage above of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all subsequent fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not apply. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of total compensation of all active members. (i) Final contribution rate.-- For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate shall be 5% of total compensation of all active members. For each subsequent fiscal year for which the collared contribution rate is applicable, the final contribution rate shall be the collared contribution rate plus the costs added by legislation. For all other fiscal years, the final contribution rate shall be the actuarially required contribution rate, provided that the final contribution rate shall not be less than the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b).

(b) Legislative finding.-- It is hereby determined and declared that: (1) As a matter of legislative finding, the health, safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth are directly dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism. (2) Unemployment, the spread of poverty and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth through the development of mixed-use projects by parking authorities in cities of the first class. (3) Due to the size, total population and population density of a city of the first class, it may be inefficient to devote property within a city of the first class solely to parking facilities and that development of mixed-use projects that include a parking component and a commercial, industrial, residential or retail component can be an important factor in the continual encouragement, development, attraction, stimulation, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within a city of the first class, the surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (c) Mixed-use projects.-- Without limiting the powers set forth in section 5505 (relating to purposes and powers), an authority shall have the power to do all acts that, in the judgment of the board, are necessary, convenient or useful to the development or operation of one or more mixed-use projects, including, with the approval of a city of the first class, the power to plan, design, locate, acquire, hold, construct, finance, improve, maintain, operate, own, lease, either in the capacity of lessor or lessee, land, buildings, other structures and personal property necessary, convenient or useful to the development and operation of a mixed-use project. An authority shall have the power to finance mixed-use projects by borrowing money and making and issuing bonds and by making loans which may be evidenced by and secured as may be provided in loan agreements, mortgages, security agreements or any other contracts, instruments or agreements which may contain such provisions as the authority shall deem necessary, convenient or useful for the security or protection of the authority or its bondholders. An authority may pledge, mortgage, hypothecate or otherwise encumber all or any part of its property, real or personal, constituting all or part of a mixed-use project, including, but not limited to, the revenues or receipts of the authority from one or more mixed-use projects, for all or any of the obligations, including bonds, of the authority incurred in connection with the development or operation of a mixed-use project. An authority shall not have the power to engage in business, trade or commerce for a profit as an owner or lessee of a mixed-use project or otherwise. An authority shall have and may exercise the powers set forth in this section notwithstanding any other provision of law or any provisions of its articles of incorporation. (d) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"mixed-use project\" means any project that includes a public parking garage component and a commercial, industrial, residential or retail component. In addition to a public parking garage, which shall be a required component of all mixed-use projects, a mixed-use project may also include public parking lots. The commercial, industrial, residential or retail component of a mixed-use project must be located within, above, below or contiguous to the parking garage.

(a) Findings and declaration.-- The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) The health, safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth are directly dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism. (2) Unemployment, the spread of poverty and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth through the support of commercial and residential real estate development by parking authorities in cities of the second class. (3) Due to the size, total population and population density of a city of the second class, it can be inefficient to devote property within a city of the second class solely to parking facilities for purely public use on a first-come, first-served basis, and that empowering the authority of a city of the second class to grant private interests in parking facilities to support commercial and residential real estate development and develop, operate or participate in mixed-use projects can be an important factor in the continual encouragement, development, attraction, stimulation, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within a city of the second class, the surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (b) Powers.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including this chapter, and any provision of an authority's articles of incorporation, and without limiting the powers in section 5505 (relating to purposes and powers), an authority in a city of the second class shall have the power to do the following: (1) Grant an interest, such as a lease, license or easement, in and to all or a portion of land, buildings and structures for dedicated parking to support commercial or residential uses, if the following apply: (i) In the good faith opinion of the board, the following apply: (A) The grant of the interest will not negatively impact the financial standing of the authority. (B) The consideration for the grant of the interest is appropriate considering the overall transaction. (ii) The term of the interest does not extend beyond the term of existence of the authority. The grant of the interest is not permissible where the average occupancy rate of parking spaces for the prior six calendar months has exceeded 90% for that particular facility. (2) Develop, operate or participate in the development or operation of one or more mixed-use projects. (3) Finance mixed-use projects by incurring indebtedness, whether by borrowing money, making and issuing notes, bonds or other debt instruments or entering into financing transactions, which may be evidenced and secured by agreements that contain provisions as determined by the authority for the security or protection of the authority or the authority's bondholders. An authority may pledge, hypothecate or encumber all or a part of the authority's revenues or real or personal property, constituting all or part of a mixed-use project for an obligation of the authority incurred in connection with the development or operation of, or participation in, a mixed-use project.

(12) Facilities for generating surplus electric power which are related to incinerator plants, dams, water supply works, water distribution systems or sewage treatment plants pursuant, where applicable, to section 3 of the Federal Power Act (41 Stat. 1063, 16 U.S.C. § 796) and section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-617, 16 U.S.C. § 824a-3) or Title IV of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-617, 16 U.S.C. §§ 2701 to 2708) if: (i) electric power generated from the facilities is sold or distributed only on a sale-for-resale basis to one or more entities authorized to sell electric power to the public; (ii) the facilities have been approved by resolution or ordinance adopted by the governing body of the municipality or municipalities organizing the authority and the approval does not obligate the taxing power of the municipality in any way; and (iii) the incinerator plants, dams, water supply works, water distribution systems or sewage treatment plants are or will be located within or contiguous with a county in which at least one of the municipalities organizing the authority is located, except that this subparagraph shall not apply to incinerator plants, dams, water supply works, water distribution systems or sewage treatment plants located in any county which have been or will be constructed by or acquired by the authority to perform functions the primary purposes of which are other than that of generation of electric power for which the authority has been organized. (13) Swimming pools, playgrounds, lakes and low-head dams. (14) Hospitals and health centers. (15) Buildings and facilities for private, nonprofit, nonsectarian secondary schools, colleges and universities, State-related universities and community colleges, which are determined by the authority to be eligible educational institutions, provided that such buildings and facilities shall have been approved by resolution or ordinance adopted by the governing body of the municipality or municipalities organizing the authority and that the approval does not obligate the taxing power of the governing body in any way. (16) Motor buses for public use, when such motor buses are to be used within any municipality, and subways. (17) Industrial development projects, including, but not limited to, projects to retain or develop existing industries and the development of new industries, the development and administration of business improvements and administrative services related thereto. (18) Storm water planning, management and implementation as defined in the articles of incorporation by the governing body. Authorities, existing as of the effective date of this paragraph, already operating storm water controls as part of a combined sewer system, sanitary sewer system or flood control project may continue to operate those projects. (b) Limitations.-- This section is subject to the following limitations: (1) An authority created by a school district or school districts shall have the power only to acquire, hold, construct, improve, maintain, operate and lease public school buildings and other school projects acquired, constructed or improved for public school purposes. (2) The purpose and intent of this chapter being to benefit the people of the Commonwealth by, among other things, increasing their commerce, health, safety and prosperity and not to unnecessarily burden or interfere with existing business by the establishment of competitive enterprises, none of the powers granted by this chapter shall be exercised in the construction, financing, improvement, maintenance, extension or operation of any project or projects or providing financing for insurance reserves which in whole or in part shall duplicate or compete with existing enterprises serving substantially the same purposes. This limitation shall not apply to the exercise of the powers granted under this section: (i) for facilities and equipment for the collection, removal or disposal of ashes, garbage, rubbish and other refuse materials by incineration, landfill or other methods if each municipality organizing or intending to use the facilities of an authority having such powers shall declare by resolution or ordinance that it is desirable for the health and safety of the people of such municipality that it use the facilities of the authority and state if any contract between such municipality and any other person, firm or corporation for the collection, removal or disposal of ashes, garbage, rubbish and other refuse material has by its terms expired or is terminable at the option of the municipality or will expire within six months from the date such ordinance becomes effective; (ii) for industrial development projects if the authority does not develop industrial projects which will compete with existing industries; (iii) for authorities created for the purpose of providing business improvements and administrative services if each municipality organizing an authority for such a project shall declare by resolution or ordinance that it is desirable for the entire local government unit to improve the business district; (iv) to hospital projects or health centers to be leased to or financed with loans to public hospitals, nonprofit corporation health centers or nonprofit hospital corporations serving the public or to school building projects and facilities to be leased to or financed with loans to private, nonprofit, nonsectarian secondary schools, colleges and universities, State-related universities and community colleges or to facilities, as limited under the provisions of this section, to produce steam or to generate electric power if each municipality organizing an authority for such a project shall declare by resolution or ordinance that it is desirable for the health, safety and welfare of the people in the area served by such facilities to have such facilities provided by or financed through an authority; (v) to provide financing for insurance reserves if each municipality or authority intending to use any proceeds thereof shall declare by resolution or ordinance that it is desirable for the health, safety and welfare of the people in such local government unit or served by such authority; or (vi) to projects for financing working capital. (3) It is the intent of this chapter in specifying and defining the authorized purposes and projects of an authority to permit the authority to benefit the people of this Commonwealth by, among other things, increasing their commerce, health, safety and prosperity while not unnecessarily burdening or interfering with any municipality which has not incorporated or joined that authority. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an authority shall not have as its purpose and shall not undertake as a project solely for revenue-producing purposes the acquiring of buildings, facilities or tracts of land which in the case of an authority incorporated or joined by a county or counties are located either within or outside the boundaries of the county or counties and in the case of all other authorities are located outside the boundaries of the municipality or municipalities that incorporated or joined the authority unless either: (i) the governing body of each municipality in which the project will be undertaken has by resolution evidenced its approval; or (ii) in cases where the property acquired is not subject to tax abatement, the authority covenants and agrees with each municipality in which the authority will acquire real property as part of the project either to make annual payments in lieu of real estate taxes and special assessments for amounts and time periods specified in the agreement or to pay annually the amount of real estate taxes and special assessments which would be payable if the real property so acquired were fully taxable and subject to special assessments. (c) Effect of specificity.-- The municipality or municipalities organizing such an authority may, in the resolution or ordinance signifying their intention so to do or from time to time by subsequent resolution or ordinance, specify the project or projects to be undertaken by the authority, and no other projects shall be undertaken by the authority than those so specified. If the municipal authorities organizing an authority fail to specify the project or projects to be undertaken, then the authority shall be deemed to have all the powers granted by this chapter. (d) Powers.-- Every authority may exercise all powers necessary or convenient for the carrying out of the purposes set forth in this section, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following rights and powers: (1) To have existence for a term of 50 years and for such further period or periods as may be provided in articles of amendment approved under section 5605(e) (relating to amendment of articles). (2) To sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, complain and defend in all courts. (3) To adopt, use and alter at will a corporate seal. (4) To acquire, purchase, hold, lease as lessee and use any franchise, property, real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible, or any interest therein necessary or desirable for carrying out the purposes of the authority, and to sell, lease as lessor, transfer and dispose of any property or interest therein at any time acquired by it. (5) To acquire by purchase, lease or otherwise and to construct, improve, maintain, repair and operate projects. (6) To finance projects by making loans which may be evidenced by and secured as may be provided in loan agreements, mortgages, security agreements or any other contracts, instruments or agreements, which contracts, instruments or agreements may contain such provisions as the authority shall deem necessary or desirable for the security or protection of the authority or its bondholders. (7) To make bylaws for the management and regulation of its affairs. (8) To appoint officers, agents, employees and servants, to prescribe their duties and to fix their compensation. (9) To fix, alter, charge and collect rates and other charges in the area served by its facilities at reasonable and uniform rates to be determined exclusively by it for the purpose of providing for the payment of the expenses of the authority, the construction, improvement, repair, maintenance and operation of its facilities and properties and, in the case of an authority created for the purpose of making business improvements or providing administrative services, a charge for such services which is to be based on actual benefits and which may be measured on, among other things, gross sales or gross or net profits, the payment of the principal of and interest on its obligations and to fulfill the terms and provisions of any agreements made with the purchasers or holders of any such obligations, or with a municipality and to determine by itself exclusively the services and improvements required to provide adequate, safe and reasonable service, including extensions thereof, in the areas served. If the service area includes more than one municipality, the revenues from any project shall not be expended directly or indirectly on any other project unless such expenditures are made for the benefit of the entire service area. Any person questioning the reasonableness or uniformity of a rate fixed by an authority or the adequacy, safety and reasonableness of the authority's services, including extensions thereof, may bring suit against the authority in the court of common pleas of the county where the project is located or, if the project is located in more than one county, in the court of common pleas of the county where the principal office of the project is located. The court of common pleas shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine questions involving rates or service. Except in municipal corporations having a population density of 300 persons or more per square mile, all owners of real property in eighth class counties may decline in writing the services of a solid waste authority. The owner of multiple residential units that are served by a single water meter may periodically request the authority to adjust the amount billed by showing a minimum of five consecutive years of actual usage data to determine if the amount billed exceeds the actual usage by 30% or more. If the usage data shows that an adjustment is needed, the authority shall appropriately adjust the billing and use the adjusted amount going forward. When calculating the new amount, the authority may include up to 10% over the amount used. After an initial adjustment, the owner may not request another adjustment for five years after the adjustment is completed. (10) In the case of an authority which has agreed to provide water service through a separate meter and separate service line to a residential dwelling unit in which the owner does not reside, to impose and enforce the owner's duty to pay a tenant's bill for service rendered to the tenant by the authority only if the authority notifies the owner and the tenant within 30 days after the bill first becomes overdue. Notification shall be provided by first class mail to the address of the owner provided to the authority by the owner and to the billing address of the tenant, respectively. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require an authority to terminate service to a tenant, and the owner shall not be liable for any service which the authority provides to the tenant 90 or more days after the tenant's bill first becomes due unless the authority has been prevented by court order from terminating service to that tenant. (11) In the case of an authority which has agreed to provide sewer service to a residential dwelling unit in which the owner does not reside, to impose and enforce the owner's duty to pay a tenant's bill for service rendered by the authority to the tenant. The authority shall notify the owner and the tenant within 30 days after the tenant's bill for that service first becomes overdue. Notification shall be provided by first class mail to the address of the owner provided to the authority by the owner and to the billing address of the tenant, respectively. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to relieve the owner of liability for such service unless the authority fails to provide the notice required in this paragraph. (12) To borrow money, make and issue negotiable notes, bonds, refunding bonds and other evidences of indebtedness or obligations, hereinafter called bonds, of the authority. Bonds shall have a maturity date not longer than 40 years from the date of issue except that no refunding bonds shall have a maturity date later than the life of the authority; also, to secure the payment of the bonds or any part thereof by pledge or deed of trust of all or any of its revenues and receipts; to make agreements with the purchasers or holders of the bonds or with others in connection with any bonds, whether issued or to be issued, as the authority shall deem advisable; and in general to provide for the security for the bonds and the rights of the bondholders. In respect to any project constructed and operated under agreement with any authority or any public authority of any adjoining state, to borrow money and issue notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness and obligations jointly with that authority. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no authority shall borrow money on obligations to be paid primarily out of lease rentals or other current revenues other than charges made to the public for the use of the capital projects financed if the net debt of the lessee municipality or municipalities shall exceed any limit provided by any law of the Commonwealth. (13) To make contracts of every name and nature and to execute all instruments necessary or convenient for the carrying on of its business. (14) Without limitation of the foregoing, to borrow money and accept grants from and to enter into contracts, leases or other transactions with any Federal agency, the Commonwealth or a municipality, school district, corporation or authority. (15) To have the power of eminent domain. (16) To pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber all or any of the revenues or receipts of the authority as security for all or any of the obligations of the authority. (17) To do all acts and things necessary or convenient for the promotion of its business and the general welfare of the authority to carry out the powers granted to it by this chapter or other law, including, but not limited to, the adoption of reasonable rules and regulations that apply to water and sewer lines located on a property owned or leased by a customer and to refer for prosecution as a summary offense any violation dealing with rules and regulations relating to water and sewer lines located on a property owned or leased by a customer. Under this paragraph, an authority established by a county of the second class A which is not a home rule county shall have powers for the inspection and repair of sewer facilities comparable to the powers of health officials under section 3007 of the act of May 1, 1933 (P.L.103, No.69), known as The Second Class Township Code. (18) To contract with any municipality, corporation or a public authority of this and an adjoining state on terms as the authority shall deem proper for the construction and operation of any project which is partly in this Commonwealth and partly in the adjoining state. (19) To enter into contracts to supply water and other services to and for municipalities that are not members of the authority or to and for the Commonwealth, municipalities, school districts, persons or authorities and fix the amount to be paid therefor. (20) (i) To make contracts of insurance with an insurance company, association or exchange authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth, insuring its employees and appointed officers and officials under a policy or policies of insurance covering life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability income. Statutory requirements for such insurance, including, but not limited to, requisite number of eligible employees, appointed officers and officials, as provided for in section 621.2 of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.682, No.284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921, and sections 1, 2, 6, 7 and 9 of the act of May 11, 1949 (P.L.1210, No.367), known as the Group Life Insurance Policy Law, shall be met. (ii) To make contracts with an insurance company, association or exchange or any hospital plan corporation or professional health service corporation authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth insuring or covering its employees and their dependents but not its appointed officers and officials nor their dependents for hospital and medical benefits and to contract for its employees but not its appointed officers and officials with an insurance company, association or exchange authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth granting annuities or to establish, maintain, operate and administer its own pension plan covering its employees but not its appointed officers and officials. (iii) For the purposes set forth under this paragraph, to agree to pay part or all of the cost of this insurance, including the premiums or charges for carrying these contracts, and to appropriate out of its treasury any money necessary to pay such costs, premiums or charges. The proper officers of the authority who are authorized to enter into such contracts are authorized, enabled and permitted to deduct from the officers' or employees' pay, salary or compensation that part of the premium or cost which is payable by the officer or employee and as may be so authorized by the officer or employee in writing. (21) To charge the cost of construction of any sewer or water main constructed by the authority against the properties benefited, improved or accommodated thereby to the extent of such benefits. These benefits shall be assessed in the manner provided under this chapter for the exercise of the right of eminent domain. (22) To charge the cost of construction of a sewer or water main constructed by the authority against the properties benefited, improved or accommodated by the construction according to the foot front rule. Charges shall be based upon the foot frontage of the properties benefited and shall be a lien against such properties. Charges may be assessed and collected and liens may be enforced in the manner provided by law for the assessment and collection of charges and the enforcement of liens of the municipality in which such authority is located. No charge shall be assessed unless prior to the construction of a sewer or water main the authority submitted the plan of construction and estimated cost to the municipality in which the project is to be undertaken and the municipality approved it. The properties benefited, improved or accommodated by the construction may not be charged an aggregate amount in excess of the approved estimated cost. (23) To require the posting of financial security to insure the completion in accordance with the approved plat and with the rules and regulations of the authority of any water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, and related apparatus and facilities required to be installed by or on behalf of a developer under an approved land development or subdivision plat as these terms are defined under the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.805, No.247), known as the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. If financial security is required by the authority and without limitation as to other types of financial security which the authority may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, federally chartered or Commonwealth-chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in these lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security. Financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or federally chartered or Commonwealth-chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the financial security if the bonding company or lending institution is authorized to conduct business within this Commonwealth. The bond or other security shall provide for and secure to the authority the completion of required improvements within one year from the date of posting of the security. The amount of financial security shall be equal to 110% of the cost of the required improvements for which financial security is to be posted. The cost of required improvements shall be established by submitting to the authority a bona fide bid from a contractor chosen by the party posting the financial security. In the absence of a bona fide bid, the cost shall be established by an estimate prepared by the authority's engineer. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year from the date of posting the financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary date from the initial posting date or to 110% of the cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security may request the authority to release or authorize the release of, from time to time, portions of the financial security necessary to pay the contractor performing the work. Release requests shall be in writing addressed to the authority, and the authority shall have 45 days after receiving a request to ascertain from the authority engineer, certified in writing, that the portion of the work has been completed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon receiving written certification, the authority shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount estimated by the authority engineer to fairly represent the value of the improvements completed. If the authority fails to act within the 45-day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the requested release of funds. The authority may, prior to final release at the time of completion and certification by its engineer, retain 10% of the original amount of the posted financial security for the improvements. If the authority accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements following completion, it may require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of the dedicated improvements as well as the functioning of the improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final plat and the authority's rules and regulations. This financial security shall expire not later than 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication and shall be of the same type as set forth in this paragraph with regard to that which is required for installation of the improvements, except that it shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of the improvements. Any inconsistent ordinance, resolution or statute is null and void. (24) To charge enumerated fees to property owners who desire to or are required to connect to the authority's sewer or water system. Fees shall be based upon the duly adopted fee schedule which is in effect at the time of payment and shall be payable at the time of application for connection or at a time to which the property owner and the authority agree. In the case of projects to serve existing development, fees shall be payable at a time to be determined by the authority. An authority may require that no capacity be guaranteed for a property owner until the tapping fees have been paid or secured by other financial security. The fees shall be in addition to any charges assessed against the property in the construction of a sewer or water main by the authority under paragraphs (21) and (22) as well as any other user charges imposed by the authority under paragraph (9), except that no reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge shall be imposed or collected from a property owner who has applied for service unless the charge is based on debt and fixed operating expenses. A reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge may not exceed 60% of the average sanitary sewer bill for a residential customer in the same sewer service area for the same billing period. Any authority opting to collect a reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge may not collect the tapping fee until the time as the building permit fee is due. Tapping fees shall not include costs included in the calculation of any other fees, assessments, rates or other charges imposed under this act. (i) The fees may include any of the following if they are separately set forth in a resolution adopted by the authority: (A) Connection fee. A connection fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of the connection of the property extending from the authority's main to the property line or curb stop of the property connected. The authority may also base the connection fee upon an average cost for previously installed connections of similar type and size. Such average cost may be trended to current cost using published cost indexes. In lieu of payment of the fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requested the connection. (B) Customer facilities fee. A customer facilities fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of facilities serving the connected property from the property line or curb stop to the proposed dwelling or building to be served. The fee shall be chargeable only if the authority installs the customer facilities. In lieu of payment of the customer facilities fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requests customer facilities. In the case of water service, the fee may include the cost of a water meter and installation if the authority provides or installs the water meter. If the property connected or to be connected with the sewer system of the authority is not equipped with a water meter, the authority may install a meter at its own cost and expense. If the property is supplied with water from the facilities of a public water supply agency, the authority shall not install a meter without the consent and approval of the public water supply agency. (C) Tapping fee. A tapping fee shall not exceed an amount based upon some or all of the following parts which shall be separately set forth in the resolution adopted by the authority to establish these fees. In lieu of payment of this fee, an authority may require the construction and dedication of only such capacity, distribution-collection or special purpose facilities necessary to supply service to the property owner or owners. (I) Capacity part. The capacity part shall not exceed an amount that is based upon the cost of capacity-related facilities, including, but not limited to, source of supply, treatment, pumping, transmission, trunk, interceptor and outfall mains, storage, sludge treatment or disposal, interconnection or other general system facilities. Except as specifically provided in this paragraph, such facilities may include only those that provide existing service. The cost of capacity-related facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon their historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities. To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost. Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable. Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers. The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section. For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities. The capacity part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the total cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the system design capacity of all such facilities. Where the cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future are included in the calculation of the capacity part as permitted herein, the total cost of the facilities shall be divided by the system design capacity plus the additional capacity to be provided by the facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future. An authority may allocate its capacity-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional capacity-related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers. The cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future that will increase the system design capacity may be included in the calculation of the capacity part, subject to the provisions of clause (VI). The cost of such facilities shall not exceed their reasonable estimated cost set forth in a duly adopted annual budget or a five-year capital improvement plan. The authority shall have taken at least two of the following actions toward construction of the facilities: (a) obtained financing for the facilities; (b) entered into a contract obligating the authority to construct or pay for the cost of construction of the facilities or its portion thereof in the event that multiple parties are constructing the facilities; (c) obtained a permit for the facilities; (d) obtained title to or condemned additional real estate upon which the facilities will be constructed; (e) entered into a contract obligating the authority to purchase or acquire facilities owned by another; (f) prepared an engineering feasibility study specifically related to the facilities, which study recommends the construction of the facilities within a five-year period; (g) entered into a contract for the design or construction of the facilities or adopted a budget which includes the use of in-house resources for the design or construction of the facilities. (II) Distribution or collection part. The distribution or collection part may not exceed an amount based upon the cost of distribution or collection facilities required to provide service, such as mains, hydrants and pumping stations. Facilities may only include those that provide existing service. The cost of distribution or collections facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities. To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of replacement cost. Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable. Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers. The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section. For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities. The distribution or collection part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities divided by the design capacity. An authority may allocate its distribution-related or collection-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional distribution-related or collection-related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers. (III) Special purpose part. A part for special purpose facilities shall be applicable only to a particular group of customers or for serving a particular purpose or a specific area based upon the cost of the facilities, including, but not limited to, booster pump stations, fire service facilities, water or sewer mains, pumping stations and industrial wastewater treatment facilities. Such facilities may include only those that provide existing service. The cost of special purpose facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities. To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost. Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable. Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers. The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section. For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities. The special purpose part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of such special purpose facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the design capacity of the facilities. Where an authority constructs special purpose facilities at its own expense, the design capacity for the facilities may be expressed in terms of the number of equivalent dwelling units to be served by the facilities. In no event shall an authority continue to collect any tapping fee which includes a special purpose part after special purpose part fees have been imposed on the total number of design capacity units used in the original calculation of the special purpose part. An authority may allocate its special purpose facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional special purpose tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers. (IV) Reimbursement part. The reimbursement part shall only be applicable to the users of certain specific facilities when a fee required to be collected from such users will be reimbursed to the person at whose expense the facilities were constructed as set forth in a written agreement between the authority and such person at whose expense such facilities were constructed. (V) Calculation of tapping fee. (a) In arriving at the cost to be included in the tapping fee, the same cost shall not be included in more than one part of the tapping fee. (b) No tapping fee may be based upon or include the cost of expanding, replacing, updating or upgrading facilities serving only existing customers in order to meet stricter efficiency, environmental, regulatory or safety standards or to provide better service to or meet the needs of existing customers. (c) The cost used in calculating tapping fees shall not include maintenance and operation expenses. (d) As used in this subclause, \"maintenance and operation expenses\" are those expenditures made during the useful life of a sewer or water system for labor, materials, utilities, equipment accessories, appurtenances and other items which are necessary to manage and maintain the system capacity and performance and to provide the service for which the system was constructed. Costs or expenses to reduce or eliminate groundwater infiltration or inflow may not be included in the cost of facilities used to calculate tapping fees unless these costs or expenses result in an increase in system design capacity. (e) Except as otherwise provided for the calculation of a special purpose part, the design capacity required by a new residential customer used in calculating sewer or water tapping fees shall not exceed an amount established by multiplying 65 gallons per capita per day for water capacity, 90 gallons per capita per day for sewer capacity times the average number of persons per household as established by the most recent census data provided by the United States Census Bureau. If an authority service area is entirely within a municipal boundary for which there is corresponding census data specifying the average number of persons per household, issued by the United States Census Bureau, the average shall be used. If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal boundary but is entirely within a county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has provided the average number of persons per household, then that average for the county or geographic area shall be used. If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal, county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has calculated an average number of persons per household, then the Pennsylvania average number of persons per household shall be used as published by the United States Census Bureau. Alternatively, the design capacity required for a new residential customer shall be determined by a study but shall not exceed: (i) for water capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer, or, for sewage capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer plus ten percent. The average residential water consumption shall be determined by dividing the total water consumption for all metered residential customers in the authority's service area over at least a 12-consecutive-month period within the most recent five years by the average number of customers during the period; or (ii) for sewer capacity, the average sewage flow per residential customer determined by a measured sewage flow study. Such study shall be completed in accordance with sound engineering practices within the most recent five years for the lesser of three or all residential subdivisions of more than ten lots which have collection systems in good repair and which connected to the authority's facilities within the most recent five years. The study shall calculate the average sewage flow per residential customer in such developments by measuring actual sewage flows over at least 12 consecutive months at the points where such developments connected to the authority's sewer main. (iii) All data and other information considered or obtained by an authority in connection with determining capacity under this subsection shall be made available to the public upon request. (iv) If any person required to pay a tapping fee submits to the authority an opinion from a professional engineer that challenges the validity of the results of the calculation of design capacity required to serve new residential customers prepared under subparagraph (i) or (ii), the authority shall within 30 days obtain a written certification from another professional engineer, who is not an employee of the authority, verifying that the results and the calculations, methodology and measurement were performed in accordance with this title and generally accepted engineering practices. If an authority does not obtain a certification required under this subsection within 30 days of receiving such challenge, the authority may not impose or collect tapping fees based on any such challenged calculations or study until such engineering certification is obtained. (f) An authority may use lower design capacity requirements and impose lower tapping fees for multifamily residential dwellings than imposed on other types of residential customers. (VI) Separate accounting for future facility costs. Any portion of tapping fees collected which, based on facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future in accordance with this section, shall be separately accounted for and shall be expended only for that particular facility or a substitute facility accomplishing the same purpose which is commenced within the same period. Such accounting shall include, but not be limited to, the total fees collected as a result of including facilities to be constructed in the future, the source of the fees collected and the amount of fees expended on specific facilities. The proportionate share of tapping fees based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future under this section shall be refunded to the payor of such fees within 90 days of the occurrence of the following: (a) the authority abandons its plan or a part thereof to construct or acquire a facility or facilities which are the basis for such fee; or (b) the facilities have not been placed into service within seven years, or, for an authority which provides service to five or more municipalities, the facilities have not been placed into service within 20 years, after adoption of a resolution which imposes tapping fees which are based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future. Any refund of fees held for 20 years shall include interest for the period the money was held. (VII) Definitions. As used in this clause, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subclause: \"BOD5.\" The five-day biochemical-oxygen demand. \"Design capacity.\" For residential customers, the permitted or rated capacity of facilities expressed in million gallons per day. For nonresidential customers, design capacity may also be expressed in pounds of BOD5 per day, pounds of suspended solids per day or any other capacity-defining parameter that is separately and specifically set forth in the permit governing the operation of the system and based upon its original design as modified by those regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over these facilities. Additionally, for separate fire service customers, the permitted or rated capacity of fire service facilities may be expressed in peak flows. The units of measurement used to express design capacity shall be the same units of measurement used to express the system design capacity. Except as otherwise provided for special purpose facilities, design capacity may not be expressed in terms of equivalent dwelling units. \"Outstanding debt.\" The principal amount outstanding of any bonds, notes, loans or other form of indebtedness used to finance or refinance facilities included in the tapping fee. \"Service line.\" A water or sewer line that directly connects a single building or structure to a distribution or collection facility. \"System design capacity.\" The design capacity of the system for which the tapping fee is being calculated which represents the total design capacity of the treatment facility or water sources. (ii) Every authority charging a tapping, customer facilities or connection fee shall do so only pursuant to a resolution adopted at a public meeting of the authority. The authority shall have available for public inspection a detailed itemization of all calculations, clearly showing the maximum fees allowable for each part of the tapping fee and the manner in which the fees were determined, which shall be made a part of any resolution imposing such fees. A tapping, customer facilities or connection fee may be revised and imposed upon those who subsequently connect to the system, subject to the provisions and limitations of the act. (iii) No authority shall have the power to impose a connection fee, customer facilities fee, tapping fee or similar fee except as provided specifically under this section. (iv) A municipality or municipal authority with available excess sewage capacity, wishing to sell a portion of that capacity to another municipality or municipal authority, may not charge a higher cost for the capacity portion of the tapping fee as the selling entity charges to its customers for the capacity portion of the tapping fee. In turn, the municipality or municipal authority buying this excess capacity may not charge a higher cost for the capacity portion of the tapping fee to its residential customers than that charged to them by the selling entity. (v) As used in this paragraph, the term \"residential customer\" shall also include those developing property for residential dwellings that require multiple tapping fee permits. This paragraph shall not be applicable to intermunicipal or interauthority agreements relative to the purchase of excess capacity by an authority or municipality in effect prior to February 20, 2001. (25) To construct tunnels, bridges, viaducts, underpasses or other structures and relocate the facilities of public service companies to effect or permit the abolition of a grade crossing or grade crossings subject to approval of and in accordance with a duly issued order of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. A commission order shall provide that costs payable by a public utility, political subdivision, the Commonwealth or others shall be payable to the authority. Before proceedings are instituted before the commission, the authority and the public utilities or the political subdivisions shall enter an agreement to provide for the conveyance to the authority of title to the land, structure or improvement involved as security for bonds issued to finance the improvement and the leasing of the improvement to the utility or utilities or the political subdivision or subdivisions involved on such terms as will provide for interest and sinking fund charges on the bonds issued for the improvement. (26) To appoint police officers who shall have the same rights as other peace officers in this Commonwealth with respect to the property of the authority. (27) (i) In the case of an authority created to provide business improvements and administrative services, to impose an assessment on each benefited property within a business improvement district. This assessment shall be based upon the estimated cost of the improvements and services in the district stated in the planning or feasibility study and shall be determined by one of the following methods: (A) The authority may determine an assessment determined by multiplying the total improvement and service cost by the ratio of the assessed value for real estate tax purposes of the benefited property to the total assessed value of all benefited properties in the district. (B) The authority may determine assessments upon the several properties in the district in proportion to benefits as ascertained by viewers appointed in accordance with municipal law. (C) If the district served by the authority contains single-family residential properties, including those that are part of a planned unit development, residential cooperative properties or condominium properties formed under 68 Pa.C.S. Pt. II Subpt. B (relating to condominiums) and other properties, the authority may elect to calculate assessments based on all of the following: (I) The business improvement district assessed value of each benefited single-family or residential cooperative property shall be one-half of the assessed value of the property for real estate tax purposes. (II) In the case of a condominium, the unit owners' association formed under 68 Pa.C.S. Pt. II Subpt. B shall be assessed. Individual units may not be assessed. The business improvement district assessed value of the unit owners' association shall be the sum of the assessed value for real estate tax purposes of any real estate owned by the association and such assessed value of all units, including their undivided interests in the common elements and any limited common elements, except that the value of any single-family residential unit shall be one-half of such assessed value of the unit for real estate tax purposes. The authority shall provide to the unit owners' association the calculation of the business improvement district assessed value of the unit owners' association, itemizing the assessed value of each unit as provided in this clause. The unit owners' association shall add to the condominium fee charged to a unit owner the amount of the district assessment attributable to the unit which amount shall be separately itemized on any assessment, invoice, bill or other document presented to the unit owner for payment of the condominium fee. (III) The district assessment shall be calculated on each benefited single-family residential property, benefited residential cooperative property and benefited unit owners' association by multiplying in each case the total improvement and services cost by the ratio of the district assessed value of the benefited single-family residential property, benefited residential cooperative property or benefited unit owners' association to the sum of the district assessed value of all benefited single-family residential properties, the district assessed value of all residential cooperative properties, the district assessed value of all benefited unit owners' associations and the assessed value of all remaining benefited properties in the business improvement district. (IV) The remaining benefited properties shall be assessed by multiplying in each case the total improvement and services cost by the ratio of the assessed value of the remaining benefited property to the sum of the district assessed value of all benefited single-family residential properties, the district assessed value of all residential cooperative properties, the district assessed value of all benefited unit owners' associations and the assessed value of all remaining benefited properties in the business improvement district. (V) An election by an authority under this clause shall not be revoked except through the procedures stated in subparagraph (ii) and subsection (g). (ii) An assessment or charge may not be made unless: (A) An authority submits a plan for business improvements and administrative services, together with estimated costs and the proposed method of assessments for business improvements and charges for administrative services, to the municipality in which the project is to be undertaken. (B) The municipality approves the plan, the estimated costs and the proposed method of assessment and charges. (iii) An authority may not assess charges against the improved properties in an aggregate amount in excess of the estimated cost. (iv) An authority may by resolution authorize payment of an assessment or charge in equal, annual or more frequent installments over a fixed period of time and bearing interest of 6% or less. If bonds, notes or guarantees are used to raise revenue to provide for the cost of improvements or services, the installments shall not be payable beyond the term for which the bonds, notes or guarantees are payable. (v) Claims to secure the payment of assessments shall be entered in the prothonotary's office of the county at the same time and in the same form and shall be collected in the same manner as municipal claims are filed and collected notwithstanding the provisions of this section as to installment payments. (vi) In case of default of 60 days or more after an installment is due, the entire assessment and interest shall be due. (vii) An owner of property against whom an assessment has been made may pay the assessment in full at any time along with accrued interest and costs. Upon proof of payment the lien shall be discharged. (viii) For purposes of determining assessments in accordance with subparagraph (i)(A) and (C), the assessed value of a benefited property shall be without reduction for any value attributable to improvements for which an exemption or abatement has been granted under law. (ix) Any claim entered to secure the payment of an assessment against a unit owners' association shall be enforceable as a judgment for money against the unit owners' association within the meaning of and under the provisions of 68 Pa.C.S. § 3319 (relating to other liens affecting the condominium), provided that if an assessment against a unit owners' association is paid in part and the unit owners' association specifies in writing to the authority the units with respect to which full payment was made, the claim shall not be enforceable against units with respect to which full payment was made or against the unit owners' association. An authority shall discharge a lien against a unit owners' association to the extent that it constitutes a lien on a particular unit upon proof of payment, either to the unit owners' association or to the authority, by the owner of the particular unit of his itemized share of the assessment on the unit owners' association. (x) An authority that has made an election under subparagraph (i)(C) may further elect to calculate, for the assessment years included in a plan and budget, the assessments on single-family residential properties, including those that are part of a planned unit development, residential cooperative properties and residential condominium properties, at the lower of the amount determined under subparagraph (i)(C) or that aggregate value of assessments that will not exceed 5% of the authority's total annual assessments, subject to the following: (A) Any aggregate reduction in assessments on residential properties shall increase the assessments on the remaining properties in proportion to the assessments of the remaining properties calculated under subparagraph (i)(C)(IV). (B) Any further election shall be made for all assessment years included in a plan and budget, except that, for a current plan and budget, the further election shall be made for the years remaining in the plan and budget. Once made, the further election shall remain in effect for all such assessment years included in the plan and budget. (C) An authority making the further election shall hold a hearing on the proposed method of calculation. Written notice of the hearing shall be given to all owners of properties assessed by the district at least 30 days prior to the hearing. The notice shall state the proposed method of calculation. (D) The authority shall take no action on the proposed method of calculation if objection is made in writing by owners of properties representing one-third of the amount of all assessments in the district. In the case of a condominium formed under 68 Pa.C.S. Pt. II Subpt. B, the condominium association and all condominium units shall be treated as one property, valued in the manner described in subparagraph (i)(C)(II). Any objection must be made within 30 days of the hearing in writing signed by the property owner and filed in the registered office of the authority. (E) No further hearing shall be required, no amendment of the authority's plan and budget shall be required and no action on the part of the municipality shall be required. (28) To adopt rules and regulations to provide for the safety of persons using facilities of an airport authority pertaining to vehicular traffic control. Police officers appointed under paragraph (26) shall enforce them. (29) To provide financing for insurance reserves by making loans evidenced and secured by loan agreements, security agreements or other instruments or agreements. These instruments or agreements may contain provisions the authority deems necessary or desirable for the security or protection of the authority or its bondholders. (30) Where a sewer or water system of an authority is to be extended at the expense of the owner of properties or where the authority otherwise would construct customer facilities referred to in paragraph (24), other than water meter installation, a property owner shall have the right to construct the extension or install the customer facilities himself or through a subcontractor approved by the authority, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The authority shall have the right, at its option, to perform the construction itself only if the authority provides the extension or customer facilities at a lower cost and within the same timetable specified or proposed by the property owner or his approved subcontractor. Construction by the property owner shall be in accordance with an agreement for the extension of the authority's system and plans and specifications approved by the authority and shall be undertaken only pursuant to the existing regulations, requirements, rules and standards of the authority applicable to such construction. Construction shall be subject to inspection by an inspector authorized to approve similar construction and employed by the authority during construction. When a main is to be extended at the expense of the owner of properties, the property owner may be required to deposit with the authority, in advance of construction, the authority's estimated reasonable and necessary cost of reviewing plans, construction inspections, administrative, legal and engineering services. The authority may require that construction shall not commence until the property owner has posted appropriate financial security in accordance with paragraph (23). The authority may require the property owner to reimburse it for reasonable and necessary expenses it incurred as a result of the extension. If an independent firm is employed for engineering review of the plans and the inspection of improvements, reimbursement for its services shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the independent firm for work performed for similar services in the community. The fees shall not exceed the rate or cost charged by the independent firm to the authority when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants. Upon completion of construction, the property owner shall dedicate and the authority shall accept the extension of the authority's system if dedication of facilities and the installation complies with the plans, specifications, regulations of the authority and the agreement. An authority may provide in its regulations those facilities which, having been constructed at the expense of the owner of properties, the authority will require to be dedicated and which facility or facilities the authority will accept as a part of its system. (i) In the event the property owner disputes the amount of any billing in connection with the review of plans, construction inspections, administrative, legal and engineering services, the property owner shall, within 60 days of the date of billing, notify the authority that the billing is disputed as excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the authority shall not delay or disapprove any application or any approval or permit related to the extension or facilities due to the property owner's dispute over the disputed billings unless the property owner has failed to make payment in accordance with the decision rendered under clause (iii) within 60 days after the mailing date of such decision. (ii) If, within 60 days from the date of billing, the authority and the property owner cannot agree on the amount of billings which are reasonable and necessary, the property owner shall have the right to request the appointment of another professional consultant to serve as arbitrator. The property owner and the authority whose fees are being challenged shall, by mutual agreement, appoint a professional of the same profession or discipline licensed in Pennsylvania to review the billings and make a determination as to the amount of billings which is reasonable and necessary. (iii) The professional appointed as arbitrator under clause (ii) shall hear evidence and review the documentation as the professional in his or her sole opinion deems necessary and shall render a decision within 50 days of the date of appointment. Based upon the decision of the arbitrator, the property owner or authority shall be required to pay any amounts necessary to implement the decision within 60 days. In the event the property owner has paid the authority or retained professional consultant an amount in excess of the amount determined to be reasonable and necessary, the authority or retained professional consultant shall within 60 days reimburse the excess payment. (iv) In the event that the authority and property owner cannot agree upon the professional to be appointed within 20 days of the request for appointment of an arbitrator, the president judge of the court of common pleas of the judicial district in which the municipality is located, or if at the time there is no president judge, the senior active judge then sitting upon application of either party shall appoint a professional, who shall be neither the authority engineer nor any professional who has been retained by or performed services for the authority or the property owner within the preceding five years. (v) The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid by the property owner if the disputed fee is upheld by the arbitrator. The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid by the authority if the disputed fee is $2,500 or greater than the payment decided by the arbitrator. The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid in an equal amount by the property owner and the authority if the disputed fee is less than $2,500 of the payment decided by the arbitrator. (vi) In the event that the disputed fees have been paid and the arbitrator finds that the disputed fees are unreasonable or excessive by more than $10,000, the arbitrator shall: (A) award the amount of the fees found to be unreasonable or excessive to the party that paid the disputed fee; and (B) impose a surcharge of 4% of the amount found as unreasonable or excessive to be paid to the party that paid the disputed fee. (vii) An authority or property owner shall have 100 days after paying a fee to dispute any fee charged as being unreasonable or excessive. (31) Where a property owner constructs or causes to be constructed at his expense any extension of a sewer or water system of an authority, the authority shall provide for the reimbursement to the property owner when the owner of another property not in the development for which the extension was constructed connects a service line directly to the extension within ten years of the date of the dedication of the extension to the authority in accordance with the following provisions: (i) Reimbursement shall be equal to the distribution or collection part of each tapping fee collected as a result of subsequent connections. An authority may deduct from each reimbursement payment an amount equal to 5% of it for administrative expenses and services rendered in calculating, collecting, monitoring and disbursing the reimbursement payments to the property owner. (ii) Reimbursement shall be limited to those lines which have not previously been paid for by the authority. (iii) The authority shall, in preparing necessary reimbursement agreements with a property owner for whose benefit reimbursement will be provided, attach as an exhibit an itemized listing of all sewer and water facilities for which reimbursement shall be provided. (iv) The total reimbursement which a property owner may receive may not exceed the cost of labor and material, engineering design charges, the cost of performance and maintenance bonds, authority review and inspection charges as well as flushing and televising charges and any and all charges involved in the acceptance and dedication of such facilities by the authority, less the amount which would be chargeable to the property owner based upon the authority's collection and distribution tapping fees which would be applicable to all lands of the property owner directly or indirectly served through extensions if the property owner did not fund the extension. (v) An authority shall notify by certified mail, to the last known address, the property owner for whose benefit a reimbursement shall apply. This shall be done within 30 days of the authority's receipt of the reimbursement payment. If a property owner does not claim a reimbursement payment within 120 days after the mailing of the notice, the payment shall become the sole property of the authority with no further obligation on the part of the authority to refund the payment to the property owner. (32) (Deleted by amendment). (33) Provisions of paragraphs (30) and (31) shall apply to residential customers in a municipality where the sewer service is being purchased by the municipality or sewer authority from another municipality or sewer authority having excess sewage capacity. (34) In the case of an authority that performs storm water planning, management and implementation, reasonable and uniform rates may be based in whole or in part on property characteristics, which may include installation and maintenance of best management practices approved and inspected by the authority. (e) Prohibition.-- (1) An authority may not pledge the credit or taxing power of the Commonwealth or its political subdivision. (2) The obligations of an authority are not obligations of the Commonwealth or its political subdivision. (3) Neither the Commonwealth nor a political subdivision shall be liable for the payment of principal of or interest on obligations of an authority. (f) Authorization to control airports.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent an authority which owns or operates an airport as a project from leasing airport land on a short-term or long-term basis for commercial, industrial or residential purposes when the land is not immediately needed for aviation or aeronautical purposes in the judgment of the authority. (g) Authorization to make business improvements and provide administrative services.-- An authority may be established to make business improvements or provide administrative services in districts designated by a municipality or by municipalities acting jointly and zoned commercial or used for general commercial purposes or in contiguous areas if the inclusion of a contiguous area is directly related to the improvements and services proposed by the authority. The authority shall make planning or feasibility studies to determine needed improvements or administrative services. The following shall also apply: (1) The authority shall be required to hold a public hearing on the proposed improvement or service, the estimated costs thereof and the proposed method of assessment and charges. Notice of the hearing shall be advertised at least ten days before it occurs in a newspaper whose circulation is within the municipality where the authority is established. At the public hearing any interested party may be heard. (2) Written notice of the proposed improvement or service, its estimated cost, the proposed method of assessment and charges and project cost to individual property owners shall be given to each property owner and commercial lessee in benefited properties in the district at least 30 days prior to the public hearing. (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (4), the authority shall take no action on proposed improvement or service if objection is made in writing by: (i) persons representing the ownership of one-third of the benefited properties in the district; or (ii) property owners of the proposed district whose property valuation as assessed for taxable purposes shall amount to more than one-third of the total property valuation of the district. (4) In the case of an authority that has elected to make assessments under subsection (d)(27)(i)(C), the objections in writing must be made by either: (i) one-third of the owners of benefited commercial properties; or (ii) owners of properties representing one-third of the amount of all business improvement district assessments for the first year of the proposed plan and budget after the reduction in district assessments under subsection (d)(27)(i)(C). For purposes of calculating one-third of the benefited commercial properties, the term benefited commercial properties shall include all nonresidential property, each condominium association formed under 68 Pa.C.S. Pt. II Subpt. B as one property and may not include any individual condominium so formed nor any single-family residential property. (5) Objection must be made within 45 days after the conclusion of the public hearing. Objections must be in writing, signed and filed in the office of the governing body of the municipality in which the district is located and in the registered office of the authority.

(c.1) Adjustments.-- Adjustments to the base amounts specified under subsections (a)(1), (b) and (c) shall be made as follows: (1) The Department of Labor and Industry shall determine the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPI-U) for the United States City Average as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2012, and for each successive 12-month period thereafter. (2) If the department determines that there is no positive percentage change, then no adjustment to the base amounts shall occur for the relevant time period provided for in this subsection. (3) (i) If the department determines that there is a positive percentage change in the first year that the determination is made under paragraph (1), the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by each base amount, and the products shall be added to the base amounts, respectively, and the sums shall be preliminary adjusted amounts. (ii) The preliminary adjusted amounts shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a)(1), (b) and (c). (4) In each successive year in which there is a positive percentage change in the CPI-U for the United States City Average, the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by the most recent preliminary adjusted amounts, and the products shall be added to the preliminary adjusted amount of the prior year to calculate the preliminary adjusted amounts for the current year. The sums thereof shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the new final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a)(1), (b) and (c). (5) The determinations and adjustments required under this subsection shall be made in the period between October 1 and November 15 of the year following the effective date of this subsection and annually between October 1 and November 15 of each year thereafter. (6) The final adjusted base amounts and new final adjusted base amounts obtained under paragraphs (3) and (4) shall become effective January 1 for the calendar year following the year in which the determination required under paragraph (1) is made. (7) The department shall publish notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin prior to January 1 of each calendar year of the annual percentage change determined under paragraph (1) and the unadjusted or final adjusted base amounts determined under paragraphs (3) and (4) at which competitive bidding is required under subsection (a)(1) and (b) and written or telephonic price quotations are required under subsection (c), for the calendar year beginning the first day of January after publication of the notice. The notice shall include a written and illustrative explanation of the calculations performed by the department in establishing the unadjusted or final adjusted base amounts under this subsection for the ensuing calendar year. (8) The annual increase in the preliminary adjusted base amounts obtained under paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not exceed 3%. (d) Notice.-- The term \"advertisement\" or \"public notice,\" wherever used in this section, shall mean a notice published at least ten days before the award of a contract in a newspaper of general circulation published in the municipality where the authority has its principal office or, if no newspaper of general circulation is published therein, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the authority has its principal office. Notice may be waived if the authority determines that an emergency exists which requires the authority to purchase the supplies and materials immediately. (e) Conflict of interest.-- No member of the authority or officer or employee of the authority may directly or indirectly be a party to or be interested in any contract or agreement with the authority if the contract or agreement establishes liability against or indebtedness of the authority. Any contract or agreement made in violation of this subsection is void, and no action may be maintained on the agreement against the authority. (f) Entry into contracts.-- (1) Subject to subsection (e), an authority may enter into and carry out contracts or establish or comply with rules and regulations concerning labor and materials and other related matters in connection with a project or portion thereof as the authority deems desirable or as may be requested by a Federal agency to assist in the financing of the project or any part thereof.

(h) Evasion.-- (1) An authority may not evade the provisions of this section as to bids or purchasing materials or contracting for services piecemeal for the purpose of obtaining prices under the amount required by this section upon transactions which should, in the exercise of reasonable discretion and prudence, be conducted as one transaction amounting to more than the amount required by this section. (2) This subsection is intended to make unlawful the practice of evading advertising requirements by making a series of purchases or contracts each for less than the advertising requirement price or by making several simultaneous purchases or contracts each below that price when in either case the transaction involved should have been made as one transaction for one price. (3) An authority member who votes to unlawfully evade the provisions of this section and who knows that the transaction upon which the member votes is or ought to be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids commits a misdemeanor of the third degree for each contract entered into as a direct result of that vote.

(a) Amount of annuity.-- A member who has made application for a disability annuity and has been found to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of section 5905(c)(1) (relating to duties of the board regarding applications and elections of members and participants) shall receive a disability annuity payable from the effective date of disability as determined by the board and continued until a subsequent determination by the board that the annuitant is no longer entitled to a disability annuity. If the sum of the products of the number of years and fractional part of a year of credited service in each class and the appropriate class of service multiplier is greater than 16.667, the disability annuity shall be a single life annuity that is equal to the sum of the standard single life annuities determined separately for each class of service multiplied by the appropriate class of service multiplier, otherwise each standard single life annuity shall be multiplied by the lesser of the following ratios: MY*/Y or 16.667/Y Where Y = total number of years of credited service; Y* = total years of credited service if the member were to continue as a State employee until attaining superannuation age as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, or if the member has attained superannuation age, as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, then the number of years of credited service and M = the class of service multiplier as applicable to that class of service at the effective date of disability. A member of Class C shall receive, in addition, any annuity to which he may be eligible under section 5702(a)(3) (relating to maximum single life annuity). The member shall be entitled to the election of a joint and survivor annuity on that portion of the disability annuity to which he is entitled under section 5702. (b) Benefit attributable to social security integration credit.-- If the member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and has social security integration credits as provided in section 5305 (relating to social security integration credits), he may elect to withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions or if he has five or more eligibility points to his credit and does not withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions he may execute an application to be filed with the board to receive, in addition to his disability annuity, an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702(a)(2). (c) Reduction on account of earned income.-- Subsequent to January 1, 1972, payments on account of disability shall be reduced by that amount by which the earned income of the annuitant, as reported in accordance with section 5908(b) (relating to rights and duties of annuitants), for the preceding calendar year together with the disability annuity payments provided in this section other than subsection (b), for the year, exceeds the product of: (1) the last year's salary of the annuitant as a member of the system; and (2) the ratio of the current monthly payment to the monthly payment at the effective date of disability; Provided, That the annuitant shall not receive less than his member's annuity or the amount to which he may be entitled under section 5702 whichever is greater. (d) Reduction on account of ineligibility.-- Payment of that portion of the disability annuity in excess of the annuity to which the annuitant was entitled at the effective date of disability calculated in accordance with section 5702 shall cease if the annuitant is no longer eligible under the provisions of sections 5905(c)(2) or 5908(b) or (c). (e) Termination of State service.-- Upon termination of disability annuity payments in excess of an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702, a disability annuitant who does not return to State service may file an application with the board for an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of the shared-risk accumulated deductions plus the regular and additional accumulated deductions standing to his credit at the effective date of disability over one-third of the total disability annuity payments received. If the annuitant on the date of termination of service was eligible for an annuity as provided in section 5308(a) or (b) (relating to eligibility for annuities), he may file an application with the board for an election of an optional modification of his annuity.

(f) Supplement for service connected disability.-- (1) If a member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and if the disability has been found to be a service connected disability and if the member is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits, such member shall receive a supplement equal to the amount determined under paragraph (2) less the sum of the annuity as determined under subsection (a) and any payments paid or payable on account of such disability under the act of June 2, 1915 (P.L.736, No.338), known as the Workers' Compensation Act, the act of June 21, 1939 (P.L.566, No.284), known as The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act, and the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.). Such supplement shall continue as long as he is determined to be disabled and is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits on account of his service connected disability in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act or The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act. If the member has received a lump sum workers' compensation payment in lieu of future weekly compensation payments, the length in weeks and calculation of the service connected disability supplement shall be determined by dividing the lump sum payment by the average weekly wage as determined by the Workers' Compensation Board.

      "text": "§ 5706. Termination of annuities. (a) General rule.-- (1) If the annuitant returns to State service or enters or has entered school service and elects multiple service membership, any annuity payable to him under this part shall cease effective upon the date of his return to State service or entering school service without regard to whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member of the system or participant in the plan or, if a multiple service member, whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member or participant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System or School Employees' Defined Contribution Plan; and, in the case of an annuity other than a disability annuity the present value of such annuity, adjusted for full coverage in the case of a joint coverage member who makes the appropriate back contributions for full coverage, shall be frozen as of the date such annuity ceases. An annuitant who is credited with an additional 10% of Class A and Class C service as provided in section 5302(c) (relating to credited State service) and who returns to State service shall forfeit such credited service and shall have his frozen present value adjusted as if his 10% retirement incentive had not been applied to his account. In the event that the cost-of-living increase enacted December 18, 1979 occurred during the period of such State or school employment, the frozen present value shall be increased, on or after the member attains superannuation age, by the percent applicable had he not returned to service. (2) This subsection shall not apply in the case of any annuitant who: (i) may render services to the Commonwealth in the capacity of an independent contractor; or (ii) is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year and who may render service to the Commonwealth: (A) as a member of an independent board or commission or as a member of a departmental administrative or advisory board or commission when such members of independent or departmental boards or commissions are compensated on a per diem basis for not more than 150 days per calendar year; or (B) as a member of an independent board or commission requiring appointment by the Governor, with advice and consent of the Senate, where the annual salary payable to the member does not exceed $35,000 and where the member has been an annuitant for at least six months immediately preceding the appointment. (a.1) Return to State service during emergency.-- When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public, an annuitant who is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year may be returned to State service for a period not to exceed 95 days in any calendar year without loss of his annuity. In computing the number of days an annuitant has returned to State service, any amount of time less than one-half of a day shall be counted as one-half of a day. For agencies, boards and commissions under the Governor's jurisdiction, the approval of the Governor that an emergency exists shall be required before an annuitant may be returned to State service. (a.2) Return of benefits.-- In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 5705 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to State service or entering school service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member or school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid. (a.3) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.-- In the event that a former State employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount so received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board, but not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave, with the repayment period not to exceed five years or such longer time as may be agreed to between the board and the member. (a.4) Return to service as a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of the act of September 30, 1983 (P.L.160, No.39), known as the Public Official Compensation Law, 42 Pa.C.S. (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure) or any other provision of law or rule of court providing for or allowing a member of the judiciary to return to service as a senior judge, senior justice, senior magisterial district judge or in any administrative, fact finding, adjudicative, appellate or other capacity with any court or tribunal or in any other capacity for which compensation is received and to receive such compensation, whether paid on a per diem, hourly, salaried or other basis, in addition to any annuity payable under this part, any such member of the judiciary who returns to State service shall be subject to the provision of this section and section 5301 (relating to mandatory and optional membership) unless that member of the judiciary is over normal retirement age or has been an annuitant for more than one year. (a.5) No contributions or credited service.-- The service of an annuitant whose annuity does not cease upon his return to State or school service shall not be subject to member contributions or eligible for qualification as creditable State service and shall not be eligible for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions, voluntary contributions or employer defined contributions. (b) Subsequent discontinuance of service.-- Upon subsequent discontinuance of service, such terminating State employee other than a former annuitant who had the effect of his frozen present value eliminated in accordance with subsection (c) or a former disability annuitant shall be entitled to an annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the present value as determined under subsection (a) to which shall be added, if the service after reemployment was as a member of the system, the present value of a maximum single life annuity based on years of service credited subsequent to reentry in the system and his final average salary computed by reference to his compensation as a member of the system or as a member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System during his entire period of State and school service. (c) Elimination of the effect of frozen present value.-- (1) An annuitant who returns to State service as an active member of the system and earns three eligibility points as a member of the system by performing credited State service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, or an annuitant who enters school service other than as a Class DC participant and: (i) is a multiple service member; or (ii) who elects multiple service membership, and earns three eligibility points by performing credited State service as a member of the system or credited school service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, and who had the present value of his annuity frozen in accordance with subsection (a), shall qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value resulting from all previous periods of retirement eliminated, provided that all lump sum payments under Option 4 or under section 5705(a.1) and annuity payments payable during previous periods of retirement plus interest as set forth in paragraph (3) shall be returned to the fund in the form of an actuarial adjustment to his subsequent benefits or in such form as the board may otherwise direct. (2) Upon subsequent discontinuance of service and the filing of an application for an annuity, a former annuitant who qualifies to have the effect of a frozen present value eliminated under this subsection shall be entitled to receive the higher of either: (i) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the freezing of the former annuitant's account pursuant to subsection (a) had not occurred, adjusted by crediting Class A State service as Class AA service as provided for in section 5306(a.1) (relating to classes of service) and further adjusted according to paragraph (3), provided that a former annuitant of the system or a former annuitant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System who retired under a provision of law granting additional service credit if termination of State or school service or retirement occurred during a specific period of time shall not be permitted to retain the additional service credit under the prior law when the annuity is computed for his most recent retirement; or (ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value eliminated, unless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity. (3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement. The interest for each year shall be calculated based upon the annual interest rate adopted for that fiscal year by the board for the calculation of the normal contribution rate pursuant to section 5508(b) (relating to actuarial cost method).

(a) Vehicles generally.-- (1) A vehicle may not be operated as a taxicab with citywide call or demand rights in cities of the first class unless a certificate of public convenience is issued by the authority authorizing the operation of the taxicab and a medallion is attached to the hood of the vehicle. Prior to the issuance of a medallion, the certificate holder shall have its vehicle inspected by the authority. (2) The authority shall require, by order or regulation, that each vehicle within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter submit to periodic inspections by authority personnel to ensure that the vehicle meets the requirements of this subchapter and authority regulations. (3) Authority inspection requirements for vehicles within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to the vehicle requirements set forth in Title 75 (relating to vehicles) and may include vehicle age and mileage limitations. Authority inspection and recording requirements shall be established by regulations. (4) No vehicle which is more than eight years old shall continue in operation as a taxicab. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority may authorize the operation of antique vehicles in call or demand service in such circumstances as the authority may deem appropriate. (5) Each taxicab certificate holder's tariff rates shall be clearly and visibly displayed in each taxicab. (6) A medallion shall not be removed from a vehicle without prior notification to and permission of the authority. (7) A medallion authorizes operation of a vehicle as a taxicab only for the fiscal year for which the medallion is issued. (b) Driver security devices.-- Each vehicle authorized to provide taxicab service shall be equipped with such security devices as the authority may, in its discretion, require by order or regulation. (c) Service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon call or demand and parcels, packages and property at the same basic metered rates charged to passengers: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its centralized dispatch system; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as a continuous part of a trip. (d) Other vehicles.-- (1) A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission authorizing call or demand service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and property: (i) to cities of the first class in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (ii) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond that city of the first class if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its radio dispatch service. (2) Carriers authorized by the authority to provide taxicab service to designated areas within cities of the first class on a non-citywide basis pursuant to section 5711(c)(2.1) (relating to power of authority to issue certificates of public convenience) shall retain their authorization in those areas of a city of the first class subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the authority and orders and regulations of the authority issued under this chapter. The authority shall not grant additional rights to new or existing carriers to serve designated areas within cities of the first class on a non-citywide basis. (e) Penalties involving certificated taxicabs.-- Operating a certificated taxicab in violation of subsections (a) and (b) or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders of subsections (a) and (b) may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725 (relating to civil penalties). (f) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a taxicab, or giving the appearance of offering call or demand service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience and a medallion is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each offense thereafter. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as or appearing as a taxicab without a certificate of public convenience and a medallion are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (g) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) The authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles, medallions and equipment which are utilized to provide call or demand service in cities of the first class without a proper certificate of public convenience issued by the authority or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and payment of the costs of the authority associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle, medallion and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction. (ii) To all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner and operator of the confiscated property. (iii) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the lien of any registered lienholder of the confiscated property upon demand. (iv) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the registered owner of the confiscated property upon demand. (v) When not claimed by any registered lienholder or registered owner within one year of the auction date, remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the fund. (g.1) Assessment.-- After application of the proceeds from the sale of confiscated property under subsection (f), the uncompensated costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction and all outstanding penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property may be assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property as the authority may prescribe by regulation. (h) Counterfeit medallions.-- The manufacture or possession of a counterfeit medallion is a misdemeanor of the third degree for each offense.

(a.2) Other limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide nonexclusive, scheduled limousine service may transport persons and their baggage to or from any airport, railroad station or hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class without advance reservation in accordance with rules and regulations established by the authority. (a.3) Commission limousine certificate holders.-- A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service in a city of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the commission authorizing limousine service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and their baggage: (1) to a city of the first class upon advance reservation and in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (2) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond the city of the first class upon advance reservation in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience, excluding service from any airport, railroad station and hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class. (b) Enforcement.-- (1) The provisions of this subchapter and the rules and regulations promulgated by the authority pursuant to this subchapter shall be enforced within cities of the first class by authority personnel. (2) The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission may initiate actions before the authority. (c) Restrictions.-- (1) Certificates issued pursuant to this subchapter shall be nontransferable unless a transfer is approved by the authority. (2) A limousine service provider operating pursuant to an authority-issued certificate of public convenience and a filed tariff permitting the limousine service provider to charge mileage-based rates on the effective date of this paragraph shall be permitted to continue to charge mileage-based rates and to be regulated in the same manner as traditional limousine service providers. (d) Penalties involving certified limousines.-- Operating a certificated limousine in violation of this subchapter and authority regulations with regard to limousine service in a city of the first class or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745 (relating to civil penalties). (e) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a limousine or giving the appearance of offering limousine service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience, is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each subsequent offense. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as a limousine without a certificate of public convenience are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (f) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) In addition to penalties provided for in subsections (d) and (e), the authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles and equipment which are utilized to provide limousine service without a proper certificate of public convenience in a city of the first class or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and equipment and payment of the authority's costs associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction. (ii) To all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner and operator of the confiscated property. (iii) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the lien of any registered lienholder of the confiscated property upon demand. (iv) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the registered owner of the confiscated property upon demand. (v) When not claimed by any registered lienholder or registered owner within one year of the auction date, remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the fund. (f.1) Assessment.-- After application of the proceeds from the sale of confiscated property under subsection (f), the uncompensated costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction and all outstanding penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property may be assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property as the authority may prescribe by regulation.

The General Assembly hereby finds and declares as follows: (1) The health, safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth are directly dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within this Commonwealth. (2) Unemployment, the spread of indigency and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. (3) Development and continuation of a major convention center is most appropriate in a city of the first class which, because of size, is capable of attracting major national conventions, and the attraction of business to this Commonwealth as a result of the development and continuation is an important factor in the continual encouragement, promotion, attraction, stimulation, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within a city of the first class, its surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (4) The purpose of a convention center should be the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in a city of the first class, its surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (5) The development and continuation of a convention center will provide benefits to the hotel industry throughout the entire region where the convention center is developed. (6) The development and continuation of a convention center will also provide benefits to the restaurant and entertainment industries throughout the entire region where the convention center is located, to all other businesses and individuals benefited by the attraction of major conventions and tourists, to other individual businesses whose livelihood is dependent on the attraction of major conventions and tourists and to the general public. (7) The need for and promotion of the type of facility which provides and will continue to provide significant benefits to the general public will require the expenditure of public money, and it is appropriate to authorize a city of the first class where the convention center is located to impose and collect a tax or continue to impose and collect a tax, applicable within the entire territorial limits of the city, to facilitate the development or continuation of a convention center and the promotion of tourism within the city of the first class and the region. (8) To promote the development and continuation of a convention center within this Commonwealth, it is necessary to provide additional and flexible means of developing, constructing, designing, managing, financing and operating such a convention center. (9) An important aspect of the development and continuation of a convention center should be the removal of blighted areas and the redevelopment of blighted areas. (10) The policy of this Commonwealth is to promote the health, safety, employment, business opportunities and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing for the creation and continuation of a convention center authority, which shall exist and operate as a public instrumentality of this Commonwealth for the public purpose of promoting, attracting, stimulating, developing and expanding business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. This purpose is declared to be a public purpose supporting the enactment of all provisions of this chapter and for which public money may be spent, taxes may be imposed and continued and private property may be acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain.",

(a) Capital budget.-- At least 90 days before the commencing of the ensuing fiscal year of the authority, the board shall cause to be prepared and submitted to it a recommended capital budget. The capital budget shall show in detail the capital expenditures to be made or incurred in the next fiscal year which are to be financed from funds subject to control or appropriation by the board. The capital budget shall be prepared with the aid of the Secretary of the Budget and the chief financial officer of the city and shall be in a form and detail satisfactory to them. In the event that the capital budget is not in a form and detail satisfactory to either the Secretary of the Budget or the chief financial officer of the city, either official may require that the capital budget be redrafted and resubmitted. The official shall not be considered to be in receipt of the capital budget or any amendments to the capital budget unless the form and detail is to the officer's satisfaction. For each separate purpose, project, facility or other property, the amount and the source of the money which has been spent, encumbered or is intended to be spent or encumbered during the fiscal year shall be shown. No later than the date of the adoption of the annual operating budget, the board shall adopt a capital budget by a majority vote of its members. (b) Operating budget.-- At least 90 days before the commencing of the ensuing fiscal year of the authority, the board shall cause to be prepared and submitted to it a recommended operating budget. The operating budget shall be prepared with the aid of the chief financial officer of the city and shall be in form and detail satisfactory to him.

The chief financial officer shall not be considered to be in receipt of the operating budget or any amendments to the operating budget unless the form and detail is to the officer's satisfaction. The operating budget should set forth the estimated receipts and revenue of the authority during the next fiscal year. The board shall, at least 30 days before the end of the fiscal year, adopt, by a majority vote of its members, an operating budget for the next fiscal year. (c) Additional approvals or disapprovals.-- If the Secretary of the Budget or the chief financial officer of the city in which the convention center is located are among the members appointed to the board of the authority or if they sit as ex officio members of the board, each shall have the right to approve or disapprove each line item of the capital budget of the authority and any amendments to it as well as all change orders. In addition, the chief financial officer of the city shall have the right to approve or disapprove the total amount of the operating budget of the authority and any amendments increasing the aggregate amount. In the case of both the capital and operating budgets and change orders of the authority, approval shall be presumed unless the chief financial officer of the city has disapproved the entire operating budget or relevant amendments to it or either the chief financial officer of the city or the Secretary of the Budget has disapproved all or part of the capital budget of the authority or amendments to it or change orders within 30 days of the receipt of the respective budgets, amendments to the respective budgets or change orders. The Secretary of the Budget or the chief financial officer of the city may establish a threshold level below which the officers will not exercise their right to disapprove change orders and may identify categories or types of change orders for which they will not exercise that right. (d) Project design.-- Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the design for any capital project undertaken by the authority shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Budget and the chief financial officer of the city for approval.

In the case of the schematic design and preliminary design development documents for any capital project or any stage or phase of a capital project, approval shall be presumed unless the Secretary of the Budget or the chief financial officer of the city has disapproved the design and expressly set forth his objections to the documents within 45 days of the receipt of the documents. Further design approval shall not be required provided the construction documents are consistent with the design set forth in the schematic and preliminary design development documents.

Any inspection shall be made during normal business hours and shall be conducted in such a manner as to not disrupt the work of constructing the convention center and shall be made solely for the purpose of observing the construction of the project. The inspectors shall report to the Secretary of the Budget for the purpose of assisting the secretary in carrying out his duties and responsibilities as provided by this section.",

Distributors shall be liable to the Commonwealth for the collection and payment of the tax imposed by this section. The tax shall be collected by the distributor and shall be paid to the Commonwealth only once with respect to any fuels. (b) Annual adjustment.-- Beginning on January 1, 1986, and each January 1 thereafter, the tax imposed under this section shall be adjusted annually and shall be set for that calendar year. The adjustment shall be based upon the percentage change of the Producer Price Index for Jet Fuel, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States Department of Labor, for the most recent 12-month period available as of the immediately preceding November 1. For every 10% increase or decrease in the Producer Price Index, as determined by comparing the index for the first month of the 12-month period with the index for the last month of the period, there shall be a 0.1¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, increase or decrease in the rate of tax.

(c) Construction of section.-- This section shall be construed in conjunction with the act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, as if jet fuels were liquid fuels as defined in that act, and all of the provisions of that act, except for section 4 thereof to the extent it imposes any tax, shall apply to the collection, administration and enforcement of the tax imposed under this section. Upon the effective date of the tax imposed by this section upon jet fuels, such jet fuels shall not be subject to the tax imposed by the act of January 14, 1952 (1951 P.L.1965, No.550), known as the Fuel Use Tax Act, except that dealer-users shall remain liable to report and pay the fuel use tax on any jet fuels used thereafter upon which the tax provided by this section has not been imposed. (d) Disposition of taxes.-- All moneys collected under this section shall be deposited by the State Treasurer in the Aviation Restricted Account. Effective Date of Tax. Section 4 of Act 164 of 1984 provided that, if Act 164 was not finally enacted on or before July 1, 1984, the tax imposed under section 6131 shall not be effective as of July 1, 1984, but shall be effective on the first day of the first month following final enactment (November 1, 1984).

The additional debt limit may be so utilized only to provide funds for and towards the cost of capital facilities for any or any combination of the foregoing purposes. Debt, other than electoral debt, at any time incurred for such purposes or any of them may be assigned by ordinance to this additional debt limit if the remaining borrowing capacity within the regular limits is insufficient to finance other projects deemed necessary by the governing body of the local government unit. (e) Emergency debt.-- If replacement of assets is required as a result of fire, flood, storm, war, riot, civil commotion or other catastrophe, or the replacement or any improvements are required for the prevention of dangers to health or safety, or if funds are required for the payment of tort liability not covered by insurance, or if funds are required to be used for and towards the costs of mandated installations of health, safety, antipollution, environmental protection and control facilities or of complying with other mandated Federal or State programs, a local government unit lacking sufficient remaining borrowing capacity as nonelectoral or lease rental debt or being otherwise prohibited by section 8045 (relating to effect of defeat of question) from incurring debt for the purpose, upon petition to the court of common pleas alleging the catastrophe, or the danger to health and safety, or the mandated nature of the program and the estimated costs of the proposed facilities, and upon proof thereof to the satisfaction of the court, shall be authorized, notwithstanding section 8045 or the insufficiency of nonelectoral or lease rental borrowing capacity, to incur debt, as either lease rental or nonelectoral debt, up to an additional 50% of its borrowing base if the increase is found by the court to have been made necessary under this subsection by reason of the causes set forth in the petition. The increase, together with all outstanding other additional emergency debt which may have been previously authorized under this subsection excluding any allocated to the additional debt limit under subsection (d), shall not exceed 50% of the borrowing base. Public notice of the intention to file such a petition and of the purpose for which the additional emergency debt is to be incurred shall be given by advertisement in at least one and not more than two newspapers of general circulation and in the legal journal not less than five nor more than 20 days before the filing thereof. The additional emergency debt may be incurred only for the purposes and upon the terms approved by the court. The amount of the debt initially in excess of the regular debt limits shall not thereafter be included in computing net amounts of nonelectoral or lease rental debt. (f) Limitations on incurring of debt by school districts.-- Except for purposes of refinancing existing debt under this subpart and notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no school district of the first class A through fourth classes shall incur any new nonelectoral debt or lease rental debt if the aggregate net principal amount of such new debt together with any other net nonelectoral debt and lease rental debt then outstanding would cause the outstanding total of net nonelectoral debt plus net lease rental debt of the school district to exceed 225% of the school district's borrowing base as defined in section 8002 (relating to definitions). This section shall apply regardless of whether there is an election by the school district under section 8703 (relating to adoption of referendum).

(2) The current appropriation for the payment of the principal of and overdue interest on the nonelectoral debt or for the payment of the net lease rental in the case of lease rental debt, except to the extent that the same has already been deposited in sinking funds.

(5) The amount of self-liquidating debt, subsidized debt and debt issued to fund an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, properly excluded and concurrently excludable from each respective category being computed. (6) The amount of surplus cash not specifically appropriated to any purpose and available for the payment of the principal amount of debt, but, if this deduction is claimed, the amount so claimed may not thereafter be appropriated to any purpose except the payment of debt. (7) All other solvent debts due the local government unit directly, the payment of which can be enforced as one of the unit's quick assets, and which have not been committed to any other purpose. (8) The amount of any insurance coverage indemnifying the local government unit against any outstanding liability to the extent the liability is debt. (c) Priority of applying exclusions.-- In determining net nonelectoral debt, the amounts claimed under subsection (b)(8) shall be exclusively applicable to nonelectoral debt, and subsection (b)(4), (6) and (7) shall be first applied against nonelectoral debt, with any excess being applicable against lease rental debt. (d) Valuation of legal investments.-- In computing the value of any funds, all legal investments therein shall be computed at current market values. (e) Use of debt determinations.-- The net nonelectoral debt so determined shall be used in determining compliance with the limit imposed by section 8022(a) (relating to limitations on incurring of other debt).

      "text": "§ 8125. Security for tax anticipation notes and sinking fund. (a) General rule.-- All tax anticipation notes issued in a single fiscal year shall be equally and ratably secured by the pledge of, security interest in and a lien and charge on the taxes or revenues, or both, of the local government unit specified in the authorizing resolution to be received during the period when the notes will be outstanding. The pledge, lien and charge shall be fully perfected as against the local government unit, all creditors thereof and all third parties in accordance with the terms of the resolution from and after the filing of any financing statement or statements required under Title 13 (relating to commercial code). For the purpose of this filing, the sinking fund depository, if any, otherwise, the fiscal agent or paying agent designated in the notes, may act as the representative of noteholders and, in such capacity, execute and file the financing statement and any continuation or termination statements as secured party. The authorizing resolution may establish one or more sinking funds and provide for periodic or other deposits therein and may contain covenants or other provisions as the local government unit determines. The amount of any tax anticipation notes issued in compliance with this subpart shall be general obligations of the local government unit and, if the amounts are not paid within the fiscal year in which the notes were issued, they shall be deemed to be nonelectoral debt enforceable in the manner of a general obligation which, unless funded pursuant to this subpart, shall be included in the budget of the local government unit for the ensuing fiscal year and shall be payable from the taxes and revenues of the ensuing year, notwithstanding that the amount thereof shall cause the nonelectoral debt of the local government unit to exceed the limitations of Subchapter B of Chapter 80 (relating to limitations on debt of local government units). (b) First class school districts.-- The holder of the tax anticipation notes issued by a first class school district or the sinking fund depository of the applicable sinking fund, if any, shall have the right to enforce the pledge of security interest in and lien and charge on the pledged taxes and revenues of the first class school district against all Commonwealth and local public officials in possession of any of the taxes and revenues at any time which may be collected directly from the officials upon notice by the holder or depository for application to the payment as and when due or for deposit in the applicable sinking fund at the times and in the amounts specified in the tax anticipation notes. Any Commonwealth or local public official in possession of any of the taxes and revenues shall make payment, against receipt therefor, directly to the holder of the tax anticipation notes or to the depository upon the notice and shall thereby be discharged from any further liability or responsibility for the taxes and revenues. If the payment is to a holder of tax anticipation notes, it shall be made against surrender of the notes to the payor for delivery to the first class school district in the case of payment in full; otherwise, it shall be made against production of the notes for notation thereon of the amount of the payment. The provisions of this subsection with respect to the enforceability and collection of taxes and revenues which secure tax anticipation notes of a first class school district shall supersede any contrary or inconsistent statutory provision or rule of law. This subsection shall be construed and applied to fulfill the legislative purpose of clarifying and facilitating temporary borrowings by a first class school district by assuring to holders of tax anticipation notes the full and immediate benefit of the security therefor without delay, diminishment or interference based on any statute, decision, ordinance or administrative rule or practice.

(a) General rule.-- Whenever the governing body of a local government unit shall be of the opinion that it has outstanding unfunded debt, it may, by petition to the court of common pleas setting forth the facts, request approval for the issuance of bonds or notes to fund the unfunded debt. After hearing, on such notice to the local government unit and its taxpayers as the court may prescribe, the court shall make an order granting authority to fund all or a part of the unfunded debt if the court finds that the unfunded debt is a lawful obligation of the local government unit; that there has been an unforeseeable decline in revenues or that taxes levied have not produced the revenues anticipated or that it was not reasonable to foresee the obligation; that paying the debt by curtailing municipal services will be dangerous to the public health, safety or education; and that it is not feasible or not in the public interest to levy additional taxes in the current fiscal year. The funding debt so approved shall be stated to mature in the amounts and over the number of years, not exceeding ten, as the court finds will accomplish the payment of the debt without endangering the rendering of municipal services or requiring the levying of excessive taxes. If the funding of the unfunded debt has not been approved by a vote of the electors, the order of the court upon cause shown may fix the portion, if any, which shall not be charged against the nonelectoral debt limitations of the local government unit under sections 8022 (relating to limitations on incurring of other debt) and 8125 (relating to security for tax anticipation notes and sinking fund) during the time the funding debt is outstanding. (b) Issuance and sale of bonds or notes.-- The bonds or notes representing funding debt so authorized by the court shall be issued and sold by the governing body as provided by other provisions of this subpart in respect of general obligation bonds except as these provisions are modified by this section or by orders of the court issued under this section, and the proceedings filed by the local government unit in respect of the funding bonds under section 8201 (relating to certification to department of bond or note transcript or lease, guaranty, subsidy contract or other agreement) shall include certified copies of the petition and of the order of the court. (c) Applicability.-- This section shall not apply to the funding of obligations in respect of a project or part of a project or incurred in respect of the cost of a project. Cross References.

(a) General rule.-- No bonds or notes shall be issued with a stated maturity date exceeding the sooner to occur of: (1) Forty years from the date of the series of any bonds or notes issued to evidence debt for the purpose of financing the cost of actually constructing, acquiring or improving a project or a separately financed portion of a project or funding an unfunded actuarial accrued liability. (2) (i) The useful life of the project being financed as stated in the ordinance of the local government unit enacted in connection with the series of bonds or notes to be issued for the project, which statement in the ordinance shall be conclusive for all purposes. If projects have been combined for financing pursuant to section 8101 (relating to combining projects for financing or series of bonds or notes for sale) and the projects have different useful lives, it is sufficient for this section if an aggregate principal amount of bonds or notes equal to the separate cost of each project having a shorter useful life have been stated to mature prior to the end of the useful life, and the balance prior to the end of the longest useful life. For the purpose of this paragraph, the inclusion of furnishings, machinery, apparatus or equipment for a construction or acquisition project shall not be deemed to be the combining of projects, but the useful life of the project shall be that of the building, structure or improvement constructed or acquired. (ii) Where capital budgeting is practiced and bonds are issued to fund the current portion of a capital budget involving projects of varying useful lives, a uniform term of 30 years may be used. (iii) Where the project being financed is a countywide revision of assessment of real property, the useful life shall be a term of no more than ten years. (iv) Where a project consists of the funding of all or a portion of a reserve, or a contribution toward a combined reserve, pool or other arrangement, relating to self-insurance, the useful life shall be the term specified in the ordinance of the local government unit, not to exceed 20 years, or, if none is specified, then the useful life shall be deemed to be 20 years. (b) Mandatory redemption and stated maturities or installments.-- Bonds or notes may be serial bonds or notes or term bonds or notes or any combination thereof that may be selected by the governing body of the issuing local government unit. Except for bonds or notes issued to fund an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, if term bonds or notes are issued, the bonds or notes shall be subject to mandatory redemption, and, if serial or installment bonds or notes, the amounts of the stated maturities or installments shall be fixed: (1) so as to amortize the issue on at least an approximately level annual debt service plan during the period specified for the payment of principal in subsection (c); or (2) so that the debt service on outstanding debt of the same classification, and for this purpose lease rental debt shall be considered as the same classification as general obligation debt, will be brought more nearly into an overall level annual debt service plan. (c) Deferral of stated installments or maturities or mandatory redemption.-- Except as provided by subsection (e), stated installments or maturities of principal of any series of bonds or notes or the mandatory redemption of the principal may not be deferred beyond the later of two years from date of issue or one year after estimated completion of construction. In the case of revenue or guaranteed revenue bonds, this provision will be satisfied by a covenant for the mandatory application to term bonds of such revenues as may remain after payment of interest and operating expenses up to a fixed amount conforming to subsection (b) as shall be specified in the ordinance pursuant to which the bonds or notes are issued. (d) Fixing earlier maturity dates.-- This section does not prevent the fixing of the amount of stated maturity dates so that a greater percentage of a series will mature on earlier dates than those allowable by this subpart. (e) Maturity dates for different series.-- This section does not prevent the authorization of bonds or notes of an issue for sale in one or more series, in which case the first stated maturity of a later series may be later than, but not more than 15 months later than, the last stated maturity of the next preceding series.",

(a) Net interest cost.-- Net interest cost may be determined by using either the street method or the present worth method, whichever method shall be specified in the official notice of sale. (b) Street method.-- Under the street method, a dollar amount shall be determined by computing the total amount of interest payable over the life of the series to stated maturity dates or earlier mandatory call dates and subtracting therefrom the amount of any premium paid above the aggregate principal amount of the bonds or notes or adding thereto the amount of any discount lawfully allowed in the sale. (c) Present worth method.-- Under the present worth method, there shall be ascertained the semiannual rate, compounded semiannually, necessary to discount to present worth as of the date of the bonds or notes, the amounts payable on each interest payment date and on each stated maturity or earlier mandatory redemption date so that the aggregate of such amounts will equal the purchase price offered therefor, exclusive of interest accrued to the date of delivery. The net interest cost shall be stated in terms of an annual percentage rate and shall be that rate of interest which is twice the semiannual rate so ascertained. (d) Net interest rate.-- The net interest rate for a series sold under the present worth method shall be the rate of the net interest cost. For a series sold under the street method, the net interest rate shall be determined by dividing the net interest cost by the product of $1,000 multiplied by the number of bond years from the date of the bonds or notes to the stated maturity or earlier mandatory call dates.

(b) Authorized purposes.-- The refunding may be for any one or more of the following purposes: (1) Reducing total debt service over the life of the series. (2) Reducing the annual debt service in any particular year or years by extending the life of the issue subject to the limitations imposed by section 8247 (relating to special limitation on refunding of funding debt).

(5) Substituting bonds for notes or bond anticipation notes or substituting notes for bonds.

(c) Exceptions.-- (1) No interest shall be allowed if an overpayment is refunded or applied against any other tax, interest or penalty due the local taxing authority within 75 days after the last date prescribed for filing the report of the tax liability or within 75 days after the date the return or report of the liability due is filed, whichever is later. (2) Overpayments of interest or penalty shall not bear any interest. (d) Acceptance of refund check.-- The taxpayer's acceptance of the local taxing authority's check shall not prejudice any right of the taxpayer to claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon. Tender of a refund check by the local taxing authority shall be deemed to be acceptance of the check by the taxpayer for purposes of this section. (e) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Date of overpayment.\" The later of the date paid or the date tax is deemed to have been overpaid as follows: (1) Any tax actually deducted and withheld at the source shall be deemed to have been overpaid on the last day for filing the report for the tax period, determined without regard to any extension of time for filing. (2) Any amount overpaid as estimated tax for the tax period shall be deemed to have been overpaid on the last day for filing the final report for the tax period, determined without regard to any extension of time for filing. (3) An overpayment made before the last day prescribed for payment shall be deemed to have been paid on the last day. (4) Any amount claimed to be overpaid with respect to which a lawful administrative review or appellate procedure is initiated shall be deemed to have been overpaid 60 days following the date of initiation of the review or procedure. (5) Any amount shown not to be due on an amended income or earned income and net profits tax return shall be deemed to have been overpaid 60 days following the date of filing of the amended income tax return. \"Date of resolution.\" The date the overpayment is refunded or credited as follows: (1) For a cash refund, a date preceding the date of the local taxing authority's refund check by not more than 30 days. (2) For a credit for an overpayment: (i) the date of the local taxing authority's notice to the taxpayer of the determination of the credit; or (ii) the due date for payment of the tax against which the credit is applied, whichever first occurs. For a cash refund of a previously determined credit, interest shall be paid on the amount of the credit from a date 90 days after the filing of a request to convert the credit to a cash refund to a date preceding the date of the refund check by not more than 30 days whether or not the refund check is accepted by the taxpayer after tender.

      "text": "§ 8565. Assessments and appeals for certain tax years. (a) Legislative findings.-- The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) Real estate tax assessment in a city has become increasingly at variance with principles of uniformity and sound assessment. (2) The deficiencies under paragraph (1) have been determined to be remedied by a citywide reassessment, sometimes referred to as the \"actual value initiative.\" (3) The reassessment of all properties located in a city is likely to cause substantial shifts in tax liabilities among various neighborhoods and groups of taxpayers. These shifts are likely to increase substantially the tax burdens on residential properties, particularly those properties with low to medium values. (4) As part of a reassessment, the governing body must make a major revision to the applicable tax rates in order to maintain tax revenues and fund any required tax increases. The governing body must take into account enactment of a homestead exclusion and perhaps other measures in order to alleviate an increased tax burden on lower value residential properties. (5) The governing body cannot responsibly determine the applicable tax rates without knowing the value of the tax base to which the rates apply. Currently, a city's budget, including tax revenues, must be enacted by each June 30, but tax assessments are not finalized until the following September. (6) Implementation by a city of an actual value initiative will be helped by requiring that assessed values be determined prior to adopting the city's budget and by the applicable assessment officials completing the task of determining the tax base in the city. (7) The common level ratio for a city applicable to tax year 2012, certified by the State Tax Equalization Board and published at 42 Pa.B. 2152 (April 14, 2012), has been disputed and may be subject to further dispute. The common level ratio for tax year 2013 may have similar uncertainties. The ratios for both years are determined by a State Tax Equalization Board assessment tool new to the review of properties in a city. (8) The common level ratio for a city applicable to tax year 2011, based on 2009 data and published at 40 Pa.B. 4069 (July 17, 2010), has not been disputed and is the same as the applicable established predetermined ratio. (9) Special provisions are necessary in order to address the findings set forth in this subsection. (b) Certification of values.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law: (1) For tax year 2013, the assessment office shall certify assessed values at the assessed values certified for tax year 2011, adjusted for subsequent improvements, demolition and destruction. The assessed values certified for tax year 2013 under this paragraph shall apply to all taxes on or measured by assessed values levied by a city or a school district for tax year 2013 notwithstanding any contrary enactment of a city or a school district or any contrary certification by a city, city agency or school district. (2) For tax years after tax year 2013, the assessment office shall certify market values at actual market value. In arriving at actual market value, the price at which any property may actually have been sold shall be considered but shall not be controlling. In arriving at the actual market value: (i) All three of the following valuation methods shall be considered in conjunction with one another: (A) Reproduction or replacement cost, as applicable, minus: (I) depreciation; and (II) all forms of obsolescence. (B) Comparable sales. (C) Income. (ii) The valuation process may employ systems, methodologies and technologies that meet nationally recognized assessment standards. (c) Timing of certification.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for tax years after tax year 2013, the assessment office shall certify assessed values by March 31 of the preceding year. (d) Application of established predetermined ratio.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any assessment appeal under Act 1939-404 for tax year 2013, the board and any applicable court of competent jurisdiction shall apply the established predetermined ratio applicable to a city for tax year 2011. (e) Conflicts.-- If there is a conflict between a provision of Act 1939-404 and a provision of this section, the provision of this section shall apply.",

      "text": "§ 8703. Adoption of referendum. (a) General rule.-- (1) In order to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter, a governing body shall use the procedures set forth in subsection (b). (2) Any governing body after making an election to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter may, after a period of at least three full fiscal years, elect under the provisions of subsection (c) to levy, assess and collect the taxes prohibited by section 8701(b) (relating to general tax authorization) to the extent otherwise provided by law. If the electorate approves such referendum, the governing body shall lose the authority to continue to levy an earned income and net profits tax authorized under this chapter. (b) Public referendum requirements.-- Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements of section 8716 (relating to procedure and administration), a governing body may levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter only by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at only the municipal election preceding the fiscal year when the earned income and net profits tax will be initially imposed. The referendum question must state the initial rate of the proposed earned income and net profits tax, the reason for the tax and the amount of proposed budgeted revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum, expressed as a percent increase over the prior year's budgeted revenue. Any increase in budgeted revenue between the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum and the prior year's budgeted revenue shall not exceed the annual percent change in the Statewide average weekly wage. The question shall be in clear language that is readily understandable by a layperson. For the purpose of illustration, a referendum question may be framed as follows: Do you favor the imposition of an earned income and net profits tax of X% to be used to replace (names of local taxes to be repealed), reduce real property taxes by X% by means of a homestead exclusion and provide for a one-time revenue increase of X% over the preceding fiscal year? A nonlegal interpretative statement must accompany the question in accordance with section 201.1 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code, that includes the following: the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax and the maximum allowable rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the estimated revenues to be derived from the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the amount of proposed revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum; the estimated reduction in real property taxes and the elimination of certain existing taxes under this chapter; the identification of the existing taxes to be eliminated under this chapter; the method to be used to reduce real property taxes; the class or classes of real property for which real property taxes would be reduced; and the estimated amount of real property tax reduction by class, expressed as an average percent reduction by class. Any governing body which uses the procedures under this section shall not be subject to the provisions of section 8704 (relating to public referendum requirements for increasing property taxes previously reduced) for any future increases in the earned income and net profits tax rates authorized under this chapter. Any future real property tax rate increases are subject to the provisions of section 8704. If the ballot question fails to receive a majority vote pursuant to this section, approval of the electorate under section 8704 shall not be required to increase the rate of any tax which the governing body of the affected school district is authorized to levy and increase pursuant to any other act. (c) Public referendum requirements to end participation under this chapter.-- Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements in section 4 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, a governing body may elect to end participation under this chapter in accordance with subsection (a)(2) by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at a municipal election. (d) Public requirements to initiate referendum.-- (1) If the governing body of a school district fails to place a referendum question on the ballot within two years after the effective date of this chapter, the electors of the school district may: (i) Circulate a petition which, if signed by electors comprising 2% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with the election officials and submitted to the governing body thereof, shall require the governing body to establish a local tax study commission. The provisions under paragraph (2)(v), (vi), (vii), (viii) (ix) and (x) shall not apply to this subparagraph. (ii) If the local tax study commission makes a recommendation to levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter and the governing body fails to place the recommendation or other alternative of the governing body authorized under this chapter on the ballot in accordance with this chapter at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the submission of the recommendation to the governing body, a petition under this paragraph may be circulated. If the petition is signed by the electors comprising 5% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with election officials at least 90 days prior to the next municipal election, the petition shall compel the election officials to place the recommendation upon the ballot at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the filing of the petition. (2) The following requirements shall apply to the process under paragraph (1): (i) The name and street address of each elector signing the petition and of the person filing the petition shall be clearly stated on the petition. The petition shall include an affidavit of the circulator that he or she is a qualified elector of the school district referred to in the petition; that the signers signed with full knowledge of the contents of the petition; that the signers' residences are correctly stated; and that, to the best of the circulator's knowledge and belief, the signers are qualified electors. (ii) The election officials shall, within ten days after filing, review the petition as to the number and qualifications of signers. If the petition appears to be defective, the election officials shall immediately notify the person filing the petition of the defect and may reject the petition if warranted. (iii) The petition as submitted to the election officials, along with the list of signatories, shall be open to public inspection in the office of the election officials. (iv) If the election officials find that the petition as submitted is in proper order, they shall send copies of the petition without signatures thereon to the governing body involved. (v) The procedure for the referendum shall be governed by the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code. (vi) If the election officials find the petition meets the requirements of this chapter, they shall place the proposal on the ballot in a manner fairly representing the content of the petition for decision by referendum at the proper election. (vii) The election officials shall certify the date for the referendum and shall notify the governing body at least 30 days prior to such date. (viii) At least 30 days' notice of the referendum shall be given by proclamation of the governing body. A copy of the proclamation shall be posted at each polling place on the day of the election and shall be published once in at least one newspaper of general circulation which is distributed within the school district during the 30-day period prior to the election. (ix) Approval of a referendum shall be by majority vote of those voting in the school district involved. (x) The election officials shall certify the results of the referendum to the governing body. (e) School districts located in more than one county.-- (1) In the event a school district is located in more than one county, petitions under this section shall be filed with the election officials of the county wherein the administrative offices of the school district are located. (2) The election officials receiving a petition shall be responsible for all administrative functions in reviewing and certifying the validity of the petition and for making all necessary communications with the school district. (3) If the election officials of the county receiving the petition certify that it is sufficient under this subpart and determine that a question should be placed upon the ballot, such decision shall be communicated to election officials in any other county in which the school district is also located. Election officials in the other county or counties shall cooperate with election officials of the county receiving the petition to insure that an identical question is placed on the ballot at the same election throughout the entire school district. (4) Election officials from each county involved shall independently certify the results from their county to the governing body. Cross References.

(a) Scope.-- (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (2), this section applies to taxing districts in counties within the scope of this chapter under section 8801(b)(1) (relating to short title and scope of chapter). (2) This section does not apply to a school district subject to section 327 of the act of June 27, 2006 (1st Sp.Sess., P.L.1873, No.1), known as the Taxpayer Relief Act. (3) Except as set forth in subsection (f), this section shall apply to all rates of taxes levied on an assessment roll after a countywide revision as provided in subsection (b), including millage rates established by referendum. (b) Initial rate.-- In the first year that any county implements a countywide revision of assessment by revaluing the properties and applies an established predetermined ratio or changes its assessment base by applying a change in the predetermined ratio, a taxing district levying its real estate taxes on the revised assessment roll for the first time shall reduce each tax rate levied by the taxing district, if necessary, so that the total amount of taxes levied for that year against the real properties contained in the duplicate for that rate does not exceed the total amount it levied on the properties in the preceding year. Each tax rate shall be fixed at a figure that will accomplish this purpose. (c) Final tax rate.-- After establishing a tax rate under subsection (b), a taxing district may, by a separate and specific vote, establish a final tax rate for the first year in which the reassessment is implemented to levy its real estate taxes on the revised assessment. Each tax rate under this subsection shall be fixed at a figure which limits the total amount of taxes levied for that year against the real properties contained in the duplicate for the preceding year to not more than 10% greater than the total amount it levied on the properties the preceding year, notwithstanding the increased valuations of the properties under the revised assessment. (d) New construction.-- For the purpose of determining the total amount of taxes to be levied for the first year under subsections (b) and (c), the amount to be levied on newly constructed buildings or structures or on increased valuations based on new improvements made to existing houses need not be considered. (e) Court approval.-- With the approval of the court of common pleas, upon good cause shown, any taxing district may increase the tax rate prescribed in this section, notwithstanding the provisions of this section. (f) Limitations on changes to certain rates.-- Notwithstanding subsection (c) or (e), the rate of any tax which was established by referendum and adjusted as provided in subsection (b) shall be subject to any subsequent increase, decrease or elimination only as provided otherwise by law.

(2) In any appeal of an assessment the court shall make the following determinations: (i) The market value as of the date the appeal was filed before the board. In the event subsequent years have been made a part of the appeal, the court shall determine the market value for each year. (ii) The common level ratio which was applicable in the original appeal to the board. In the event subsequent years have been made a part of the appeal, the court shall determine the applicable common level ratio for each year published by the State Tax Equalization Board on or before July 1 of the year prior to the tax year being appealed. (3) The court, after determining the market value of the property pursuant to paragraph (2)(i), shall then apply the established predetermined ratio to that value unless the corresponding common level ratio determined pursuant to paragraph (2)(ii) varies by more than 15% from the established predetermined ratio, in which case the court shall apply the applicable common level ratio to the corresponding market value of the property. (4) If a county has effected a countywide revision of assessments which was used to develop the common level ratio last determined by the State Tax Equalization Board, the following shall apply: (i) If a county changes its assessment base by applying a change in predetermined ratio, the court shall apply the percentage change between the existing predetermined ratio and the newly established predetermined ratio to the county's common level ratio to establish the certified revised common level ratio for the year in which the assessment was revised. (ii) If the county performs a countywide revision of assessments by revaluing the properties and applying an established predetermined ratio, the court shall utilize the established predetermined ratio instead of the common level ratio for the year in which the assessment was revised and until the common level ratio determined by the State Tax Equalization Board reflects the revaluing of properties resulting from the revision of assessments. (5) If a taxpayer or taxing district has filed an appeal from an assessment, so long as the appeal is pending before the board or before a court on appeal from the determination of the board, as provided by statute, the appeal will also be taken as an appeal by the appellant on the subject property for any valuation for any assessment subsequent to the filing of an appeal with the board and prior to the determination of the appeal by the board or the court. This provision shall be applicable to all pending appeals as well as future appeals. (6) In any appeal by a taxable person from an action by the board, the board shall have the power and duty to present a prima facie case in support of its assessment, to cross-examine witnesses, to discredit or impeach any evidence presented by the taxable person, to prosecute or defend an appeal in any appellate court and to take any other necessary steps to defend its valuation and assessment. (7) Appeals to a court of common pleas may be referred by the court to a board of arbitrators under 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 73 Subch. C (relating to judicial arbitration) or to a board of viewers under 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 21 Subch. E (relating to boards of viewers) in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.

(ii) Be construed to abridge, alter or limit the right of an appellant to assert a challenge under section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. (b) Appeals to Commonwealth Court or Supreme Court.-- The board, or any party to the appeal to the court of common pleas, may appeal from the judgment, order or decree of the court of common pleas. (c) Payment of taxes pending appeal.-- An appeal shall not prevent the collection of taxes based on the assessment appealed. If the assessment is reduced, then any overpayment of taxes together with interest at a rate pursuant to section 8843 (relating to spot reassessment) from the date of overpayment shall be returned to the person or persons who paid the taxes. The appellant may protest the taxes due. The protest must be in writing addressed to the tax collector. It shall be the duty of the tax collector to notify the taxing districts of any payment under protest by delivering to them a copy of the protest. The taxing districts shall be required to segregate 25% of the amount of the tax paid in a separate account and shall not be permitted to expend any portion of any segregated amount unless it first petitions the court, alleging that the segregated amount is unjustly withheld. The court shall have power to order the taxing district to use a portion of any segregated amount as the court deems reasonably free from dispute, and the remainder of the segregated amount shall be held segregated by the taxing district, pending the final disposition of the appeal. Upon final disposition of the appeal, the amount of the overpayment found to be due the appellant as a refund shall also be a legal setoff or credit against any future taxes assessed against the appellant by the same taxing district. If a taxing district alleges that it is unable to credit all of the refund due in one year, the court, upon application of either party, shall determine over what period of time the refund due shall be made and in what manner.

(a) Permit.-- Every municipality, third-party agency or the Department of Labor and Industry responsible for the issuance of building permits or demolition permits shall forward a copy of each permit to the county assessment office on or before the first day of every month. In addition to any charge otherwise permitted by law, a municipality, a third-party agency or the Department of Labor and Industry may charge an additional fee of $10 to each person to whom a permit is issued for administrative costs incurred in compliance with this section. The assessment office may provide for the electronic submission of a permit through electronic mail or any other means of electronic transmission or uploading of the permit in its existing form. The provision of permits or permit information to the assessment office as required by this section shall not be subject to the procedures of the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law. No agency, public official or public employee shall be liable for civil or criminal damages or penalties for complying with this section. (a.1) Noncompliance.-- (1) If the county assessment office has reason to believe that there is noncompliance with subsection (a), the assessment office shall provide written notice to the municipality and, if applicable, a third-party agency, or to the Department of Labor and Industry in the case of noncompliance by the Department of Labor and Industry. Upon receipt of the notice, the municipality, third-party agency or Department of Labor and Industry shall investigate and consult with the assessment office and take any steps the municipality, third-party agency or Department of Labor and Industry deems necessary to remediate the noncompliance. (2) If, after consultation, noncompliance with subsection (a) continues, the assessment office may, in the case of continuing noncompliance after notice by a municipality or third-party agency, institute an action in mandamus before the court of common pleas to compel compliance with subsection (a). Should the court determine that the noncompliance is intentional, the court shall award any costs, disbursements, reasonable attorney fees and witness fees relating to the action to the assessment office. (b) Substantial improvement.-- If a person makes improvements to any real property, other than painting of or normal regular repairs to a building, aggregating more than $4,000 in value and a building permit is not required for the improvements, the property owner shall furnish the following information to the board: (1) the name and address of the person owning the property; (2) a description of the improvements made or to be made to the property; and (3) the dollar value of the improvements. (b.1) County improvement certification form.-- The county commissioners may, by ordinance, require that all persons making substantial improvements to property as set forth in subsection (b) submit to the county assessment office a county improvement certification form setting forth the information in subsection (b) prior to beginning any substantial improvement, regardless of whether a building permit is required. The county may provide for the electronic submission of the form and a fee no greater than $5. The county may cooperate with a municipality, third-party agency or the Department of Labor and Industry in the distribution of forms. (c) Civil penalty.-- (1) The board may assess a civil penalty of not more than $100 upon a person for intentionally failing to comply with the provisions of subsection (b) or an ordinance enacted in accordance with subsection (b.1) or intentionally falsifying the information required. (2) If a civil penalty is assessed against a person under paragraph (1), the board must notify the person by certified mail of the nature of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty and that the person may notify the board in writing within 10 calendar days that the person wishes to contest the civil penalty. If, within 10 calendar days from the receipt of that notification, the person does not notify the county board of assessment of the person's intent to contest the assessed penalty, the civil penalty shall become final. (3) If timely notification of the intent to contest the civil penalty is given, the person contesting the civil penalty shall be provided with a hearing in accordance with 2 Pa.C.S. Chs. 5 Subch. B (relating to practice and procedure of local agencies) and 7 Subch. B (relating to judicial review of local agency action). (d) Existing provisions preserved.-- Nothing in this section shall supersede or preempt any ordinance, resolution or other requirement of a county to submit information on substantial improvements in effect on the effective date of this subsection. (e) Substantial improvement value.-- Beginning January 1 of the year immediately following the effective date of this subsection and each January 1 thereafter, the amount set forth in subsection (b) shall be increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland area, for the most recent 12-month period that figures have been officially reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics immediately prior to the date the adjustment is due to take effect.

(a) General rule.-- All powers as provided by laws applicable to that class of municipality shall be vested in the municipal council, except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, and the council shall provide for the exercise thereof and for the performance of all duties imposed on the municipality by law. (b) Adoption of administrative ordinance.-- The council shall by ordinance adopt an administrative ordinance defining the responsibilities of the municipal departments and agencies as it deems necessary and proper for the efficient conduct of municipal affairs. (c) Appointment of municipal manager.-- The municipal council shall appoint a municipal manager. The office of municipal manager and municipal clerk or secretary may be held by the same person. (d) Investigations.-- The council may make investigations into the affairs of the municipality and the conduct of any municipal department, office or agency. (e) Administrative departments, boards and offices.-- The municipal council shall continue or create and determine and define the powers and duties of any executive and administrative departments, boards and offices, in addition to those provided for in this subpart, as it deems necessary for the proper and efficient conduct of the affairs of the municipality, including the office of deputy manager. Any department, board or office so continued or created may be abolished by the municipal council. No member of municipal council shall head an administrative department. (f) Additional powers and limitations.-- It is the intention of this subchapter that the municipal council shall act in all matters as a body, and it is contrary to the spirit of this subchapter for any of its members to seek individually to influence the official acts of the municipal manager or any other officer, or for the council or any of its members to direct or request the appointment of any person to or his removal from office, or to interfere in any way with the performance by the officers of their duties. The council and its members shall deal with the administrative service solely through the municipal manager and shall not give orders to any subordinates of the municipal manager, either publicly or privately. This subchapter does not prevent the municipal council from appointing committees of its own members or of citizens to conduct investigations into the conduct of any officer or department, or any matter relating to the welfare of the municipality, and delegating to those committees such powers of inquiry as the municipal council deems necessary.",

(2) Unemployment, the spread of poverty and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth through the development of mixed-use projects by parking authorities in cities of the first class. (3) Due to the size, total population and population density of a city of the first class, it may be inefficient to devote property within a city of the first class solely to parking facilities and that development of mixed-use projects that include a parking component and a commercial, industrial, residential or retail component can be an important factor in the continual encouragement, development, attraction, stimulation, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within a city of the first class, the surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole.

An authority shall have the power to finance mixed-use projects by borrowing money and making and issuing bonds and by making loans which may be evidenced by and secured as may be provided in loan agreements, mortgages, security agreements or any other contracts, instruments or agreements which may contain such provisions as the authority shall deem necessary, convenient or useful for the security or protection of the authority or its bondholders. An authority may pledge, mortgage, hypothecate or otherwise encumber all or any part of its property, real or personal, constituting all or part of a mixed-use project, including, but not limited to, the revenues or receipts of the authority from one or more mixed-use projects, for all or any of the obligations, including bonds, of the authority incurred in connection with the development or operation of a mixed-use project.

(d) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"mixed-use project\" means any project that includes a public parking garage component and a commercial, industrial, residential or retail component. In addition to a public parking garage, which shall be a required component of all mixed-use projects, a mixed-use project may also include public parking lots.

(a) Findings and declaration.-- The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) The health, safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth are directly dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism. (2) Unemployment, the spread of poverty and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth through the support of commercial and residential real estate development by parking authorities in cities of the second class. (3) Due to the size, total population and population density of a city of the second class, it can be inefficient to devote property within a city of the second class solely to parking facilities for purely public use on a first-come, first-served basis, and that empowering the authority of a city of the second class to grant private interests in parking facilities to support commercial and residential real estate development and develop, operate or participate in mixed-use projects can be an important factor in the continual encouragement, development, attraction, stimulation, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within a city of the second class, the surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (b) Powers.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including this chapter, and any provision of an authority's articles of incorporation, and without limiting the powers in section 5505 (relating to purposes and powers), an authority in a city of the second class shall have the power to do the following: (1) Grant an interest, such as a lease, license or easement, in and to all or a portion of land, buildings and structures for dedicated parking to support commercial or residential uses, if the following apply: (i) In the good faith opinion of the board, the following apply: (A) The grant of the interest will not negatively impact the financial standing of the authority. (B) The consideration for the grant of the interest is appropriate considering the overall transaction. (ii) The term of the interest does not extend beyond the term of existence of the authority. The grant of the interest is not permissible where the average occupancy rate of parking spaces for the prior six calendar months has exceeded 90% for that particular facility. (2) Develop, operate or participate in the development or operation of one or more mixed-use projects. (3) Finance mixed-use projects by incurring indebtedness, whether by borrowing money, making and issuing notes, bonds or other debt instruments or entering into financing transactions, which may be evidenced and secured by agreements that contain provisions as determined by the authority for the security or protection of the authority or the authority's bondholders. An authority may pledge, hypothecate or encumber all or a part of the authority's revenues or real or personal property, constituting all or part of a mixed-use project for an obligation of the authority incurred in connection with the development or operation of, or participation in, a mixed-use project. (c) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"mixed-use project\" means a commercial, industrial, residential or retail development that includes a public parking garage or public parking lot as an appurtenance.

      "text": "§ 5510.3. Bonds in cities of the first class. (a) General rule.-- (1) The bonds of the authority shall be authorized by resolution of the board. The resolution shall specify all of the following: (i) Series. (ii) Date or dates of maturity. (iii) Interest at such rate or rates, fixed or variable, as shall be determined by the board as necessary to issue and sell the authorized bonds. (iv) Denominations. (v) Form, either coupon or fully registered without coupons. (vi) Certificated or book-entry-only form. (vii) Registration and exchangeability and interchangeability privileges. (viii) Medium of payment and place of payment. (ix) Terms of redemption. (x) Priorities of payment in the revenues or receipts of the authority as the resolution or trust indenture adopted or approved by the authority may provide. (2) The bonds shall be signed by or shall bear the facsimile signatures of such officers as the board shall determine, and coupon bonds shall have attached thereto interest coupons bearing the facsimile signature of the treasurer of the authority, and all bonds shall be authenticated by an authenticating agent, fiscal agent or trustee, all as may be prescribed in the resolution or trust indenture. (3) Any such bonds may be issued and delivered notwithstanding that one or more of the officers signing bonds or the treasurer whose facsimile signature shall be upon the coupon, or any thereof, shall have ceased to be an officer or officers at the time when the bonds shall actually be delivered. (4) The proceeds of an issue of bonds may be used to pay the costs of a project, subject to the limitations of subsection (b), to finance any cash flow deficit of the authority, to reimburse any costs of a project initially paid by the authority or any person, to fund any required reserves, to capitalize interest or to pay costs of issuance, including, but not limited to, costs of obtaining credit enhancement for the bonds. (b) Maturity.-- Bonds issued to finance the costs of a project shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their respective dates of original issue as the authority shall by resolution determine. Bonds issued in anticipation of income of the authority shall mature within one fiscal year after the fiscal year of the date of issuance thereof except for bonds issued in anticipation of grants with respect to the cost of a project, which bonds shall mature no later than six months beyond the time of anticipated receipt of the final payment of the grant. (c) Sale.-- (1) Bonds may be sold at public sale or invited sale for such price or prices and at such rate or rates of interest as the authority shall determine. Bonds may be sold at private sale by negotiation at such price or prices and at such rate or rates of interest as the authority shall determine, but only if the authority makes a written public explanation of the circumstances and justification for the private sale by negotiation. (2) Pending the preparation of the definitive bonds, interim receipts may be issued to the purchaser or purchasers of such bonds and may contain such terms and conditions as the authority may determine. (d) Negotiable instruments.-- Bonds of an authority shall have the qualities of negotiable instruments under Title 13 (relating to commercial code). (e) Refunding.-- (1) Subject to the provisions of the outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations issued under this chapter or prior acts and subject to the provisions of this chapter, the authority shall have the right and power to refund any outstanding debt, whether the debt represents principal or interest, in whole or in part, at any time. (2) As used in this subsection, \"refund\" and its variations shall mean the issuance and sale of obligations the proceeds of which are used or are to be used for the payment or redemption of outstanding obligations upon or prior to maturity. Refunding bonds shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their dates of original issuance as the authority shall determine by resolution. (f) Credit of Commonwealth and political subdivisions not pledged.-- Under no circumstances shall any bonds issued by the authority or any other obligation of the authority be or become an indebtedness or liability of the Commonwealth or of any government agency, provided that any government agency may guarantee bonds of an authority to the extent and for the purposes for which the government agency may make loans or grants to an authority. (g) Nonliability.-- Neither the board members, any employees of the authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on any bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. Bonds of an authority shall contain a statement of the limitation set forth in this subsection. (h) Bonds deemed valid.-- Any bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the authority to accomplish the public purposes of this chapter shall be conclusively deemed in any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of the bonds or security therefor to have been issued for such purpose. (i) Notice and challenges.-- (1) The authority may cause a copy of any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds adopted by it to be filed for public inspection in its office and in the office of the clerk of the governing body of each county and the governing body of a city of the first class and may thereupon cause to be published in a newspaper published or circulating in its service area a notice stating the fact and date of the adoption, the places where the resolution has been so filed for public inspection, the date of publication of the notice and that any action or proceeding of any kind or nature in any court questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the resolution or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contract provided for by such resolution shall be commenced within 20 days after the publication of the notice. (2) If any notice shall at any time be published and if no action or proceeding questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the resolution or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contract provided for by such resolution shall be commenced within 20 days after the publication of the notice, then all residents, taxpayers and owners of property in a city of the first class and all other persons whatsoever shall be forever barred and foreclosed from instituting or commencing any action or proceeding in any court or pleading any defense to any action or proceedings questioning the validity or proper authorization of such bonds or the validity of any such covenants, agreements or contracts, and said bonds, covenants, agreements and contracts shall be conclusively deemed to be valid and binding obligations in accordance with their terms and tenor. (3) After issuance of bonds, all bonds shall be conclusively presumed to be fully authorized and issued by all the laws of this Commonwealth, and any person shall be estopped from questioning their sale, execution or delivery by the authority. (j) Applicability.-- This section shall only apply to authorities in cities of the first class.

(d) Additional nonelectoral or lease rental debt.-- Additional nonelectoral or additional lease rental debt or both in the aggregate amount of 100% of the borrowing base may be incurred by a county which has assumed countywide responsibility or, where the county has not assumed countywide responsibility, by a local government unit which has assumed responsibility for its and its adjacent areas for hospitals and other public health services, air and water pollution control, flood control, environmental protection, water distribution and supply systems, sewage and refuse collection and disposal systems, education at any level, highways, public transportation or port operations. The additional debt limit may be so utilized only to provide funds for and towards the cost of capital facilities for any or any combination of the foregoing purposes. Debt, other than electoral debt, at any time incurred for such purposes or any of them may be assigned by ordinance to this additional debt limit if the remaining borrowing capacity within the regular limits is insufficient to finance other projects deemed necessary by the governing body of the local government unit. (e) Emergency debt.-- If replacement of assets is required as a result of fire, flood, storm, war, riot, civil commotion or other catastrophe, or the replacement or any improvements are required for the prevention of dangers to health or safety, or if funds are required for the payment of tort liability not covered by insurance, or if funds are required to be used for and towards the costs of mandated installations of health, safety, antipollution, environmental protection and control facilities or of complying with other mandated Federal or State programs, a local government unit lacking sufficient remaining borrowing capacity as nonelectoral or lease rental debt or being otherwise prohibited by section 8045 (relating to effect of defeat of question) from incurring debt for the purpose, upon petition to the court of common pleas alleging the catastrophe, or the danger to health and safety, or the mandated nature of the program and the estimated costs of the proposed facilities, and upon proof thereof to the satisfaction of the court, shall be authorized, notwithstanding section 8045 or the insufficiency of nonelectoral or lease rental borrowing capacity, to incur debt, as either lease rental or nonelectoral debt, up to an additional 50% of its borrowing base if the increase is found by the court to have been made necessary under this subsection by reason of the causes set forth in the petition. The increase, together with all outstanding other additional emergency debt which may have been previously authorized under this subsection excluding any allocated to the additional debt limit under subsection (d), shall not exceed 50% of the borrowing base. Public notice of the intention to file such a petition and of the purpose for which the additional emergency debt is to be incurred shall be given by advertisement in at least one and not more than two newspapers of general circulation and in the legal journal not less than five nor more than 20 days before the filing thereof. The additional emergency debt may be incurred only for the purposes and upon the terms approved by the court. The amount of the debt initially in excess of the regular debt limits shall not thereafter be included in computing net amounts of nonelectoral or lease rental debt. (f) Limitations on incurring of debt by school districts.-- Except for purposes of refinancing existing debt under this subpart and notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no school district of the first class A through fourth classes shall incur any new nonelectoral debt or lease rental debt if the aggregate net principal amount of such new debt together with any other net nonelectoral debt and lease rental debt then outstanding would cause the outstanding total of net nonelectoral debt plus net lease rental debt of the school district to exceed 225% of the school district's borrowing base as defined in section 8002 (relating to definitions). This section shall apply regardless of whether there is an election by the school district under section 8703 (relating to adoption of referendum).

(5) The amount of self-liquidating debt, subsidized debt and debt issued to fund an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, properly excluded and concurrently excludable from each respective category being computed. (6) The amount of surplus cash not specifically appropriated to any purpose and available for the payment of the principal amount of debt, but, if this deduction is claimed, the amount so claimed may not thereafter be appropriated to any purpose except the payment of debt. (7) All other solvent debts due the local government unit directly, the payment of which can be enforced as one of the unit's quick assets, and which have not been committed to any other purpose. (8) The amount of any insurance coverage indemnifying the local government unit against any outstanding liability to the extent the liability is debt.

(d) Valuation of legal investments.-- In computing the value of any funds, all legal investments therein shall be computed at current market values. (e) Use of debt determinations.-- The net nonelectoral debt so determined shall be used in determining compliance with the limit imposed by section 8022(a) (relating to limitations on incurring of other debt). The sum of the net nonelectoral debt and the net lease rental debt so determined shall be used in determining compliance with the limit imposed by section 8022(b).",

      "text": "§ 8565. Assessments and appeals for certain tax years. (a) Legislative findings.-- The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) Real estate tax assessment in a city has become increasingly at variance with principles of uniformity and sound assessment. (2) The deficiencies under paragraph (1) have been determined to be remedied by a citywide reassessment, sometimes referred to as the \"actual value initiative.\" (3) The reassessment of all properties located in a city is likely to cause substantial shifts in tax liabilities among various neighborhoods and groups of taxpayers. These shifts are likely to increase substantially the tax burdens on residential properties, particularly those properties with low to medium values. (4) As part of a reassessment, the governing body must make a major revision to the applicable tax rates in order to maintain tax revenues and fund any required tax increases. The governing body must take into account enactment of a homestead exclusion and perhaps other measures in order to alleviate an increased tax burden on lower value residential properties. (5) The governing body cannot responsibly determine the applicable tax rates without knowing the value of the tax base to which the rates apply. Currently, a city's budget, including tax revenues, must be enacted by each June 30, but tax assessments are not finalized until the following September. (6) Implementation by a city of an actual value initiative will be helped by requiring that assessed values be determined prior to adopting the city's budget and by the applicable assessment officials completing the task of determining the tax base in the city. (7) The common level ratio for a city applicable to tax year 2012, certified by the State Tax Equalization Board and published at 42 Pa.B. 2152 (April 14, 2012), has been disputed and may be subject to further dispute. The common level ratio for tax year 2013 may have similar uncertainties. The ratios for both years are determined by a State Tax Equalization Board assessment tool new to the review of properties in a city. (8) The common level ratio for a city applicable to tax year 2011, based on 2009 data and published at 40 Pa.B. 4069 (July 17, 2010), has not been disputed and is the same as the applicable established predetermined ratio. (9) Special provisions are necessary in order to address the findings set forth in this subsection. (b) Certification of values.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law: (1) For tax year 2013, the assessment office shall certify assessed values at the assessed values certified for tax year 2011, adjusted for subsequent improvements, demolition and destruction. The assessed values certified for tax year 2013 under this paragraph shall apply to all taxes on or measured by assessed values levied by a city or a school district for tax year 2013 notwithstanding any contrary enactment of a city or a school district or any contrary certification by a city, city agency or school district. (2) For tax years after tax year 2013, the assessment office shall certify market values at actual market value. In arriving at actual market value, the price at which any property may actually have been sold shall be considered but shall not be controlling. In arriving at the actual market value: (i) All three of the following valuation methods shall be considered in conjunction with one another: (A) Reproduction or replacement cost, as applicable, minus: (I) depreciation; and (II) all forms of obsolescence. (B) Comparable sales. (C) Income. (ii) The valuation process may employ systems, methodologies and technologies that meet nationally recognized assessment standards. (c) Timing of certification.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for tax years after tax year 2013, the assessment office shall certify assessed values by March 31 of the preceding year. (d) Application of established predetermined ratio.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any assessment appeal under Act 1939-404 for tax year 2013, the board and any applicable court of competent jurisdiction shall apply the established predetermined ratio applicable to a city for tax year 2011. (e) Conflicts.-- If there is a conflict between a provision of Act 1939-404 and a provision of this section, the provision of this section shall apply.",

A copy of the ordinance approved by the mayor, or other comparable official if so required under an optional form of government or home rule charter, and duly certified, accompanied by a statement of the vote thereon, with the names of the members of council voting for and against the ordinance, shall be forwarded to and filed in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and, when so filed, the Governor shall under the great seal of the Commonwealth certify the acceptance of the provisions of this chapter which certificate shall be recorded among the minutes of the council and in the office for the recording of deeds in the proper county. A city that has previously opted to become subject to the act of May 21, 1943 (P.L.571, No.254), known as The Fourth to Eighth Class and Selective County Assessment Law, or the act of June 26, 1931 (P.L.1379, No.348), referred to as the Third Class County Assessment Board Law, shall continue to be subject to this chapter. (b) Result.-- Upon becoming subject to this chapter in accordance with subsection (a), the property and persons subject to and exempt from taxation in the city for city and school purposes shall be designated in accordance with this chapter, and the assessment and valuation thereof shall be done only in accordance with this chapter and by the officers designated in this chapter. If a city in accepting the provisions of this chapter elects by ordinance to adopt an established predetermined ratio different from that used by the county, then the city shall apply the ratio selected to the actual valuation supplied by the county to determine assessed value for tax purposes. The established predetermined ratio selected by the city, if different from the ratio selected by the county, may be set at any value up to and including the actual valuation supplied by the county. (c) Alternate ratio.-- If a city accepts this chapter in accordance with subsection (a), all the provisions thereof shall apply to the city except that a city may, by ordinance, elect to adopt an established predetermined ratio different from that used by the county. References in Text. The act of May 21, 1943 (P.L.571, No.254), known as The Fourth to Eighth Class and Selective County Assessment Law, referred to in subsec.
