The contractor shall also require the subcontractor to make similar payments to his subcontractors. (7) The department shall have the right to engage the services of any architect or consulting or supervising engineer or engineers whom it may deem necessary for the proper designing of or inspection or supervision of projects constructed, altered or enlarged by the department under this section in accordance with the selection procedures of section 905. (8) Changes in scope in the plans or specifications, or both, may be made after their approval only with the consent of the Governor and all of the Commonwealth agencies and State-related institutions whose approval of the original plans or specifications, or both, was necessary under this section. (9) If the appropriation is to a Commonwealth agency, other than the department or State-related institution, the department shall award and enter into the contract as agent for the Commonwealth agency or State-related institution to which the appropriation was made.

(a) General rule.-- The commission may, on its own motion and whenever it may be necessary in the performance of its duties, investigate and examine the condition and management of any public utility or any other person or corporation subject to this part. In conducting the investigations the commission may proceed, either with or without a hearing, as it may deem best, but it shall make no order without affording the parties affected thereby a hearing. Any investigation, inquiry or hearing which the commission has power to undertake or hold shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. (b) Assignment of proceedings; powers of chairman.-- All on-the-record proceedings shall be referred to an administrative law judge for decision except that in those proceedings involving a rate determination, safety matters, rulemaking procedures, unprotested applications or matters covered by section 335(a)(1) (relating to initial decisions), the commission may authorize the chairman to assign cases as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3); and, in addition, the commission may authorize the chairman to: (1) Designate the time and place for the conducting of investigations, inquiries and hearings. (2) Assign cases to a commissioner or commissioners for hearing, investigation, inquiry, study or other similar purposes. (3) Assign cases to special agents or administrative law judges for the taking and receiving of evidence. (4) Direct and designate officers and employees of the commission to make investigations, inspections, inquiries, studies and other like assignments for reports to the commission. (5) Be responsible through the secretary for specifically enumerated daily administrative operations of the commission. (c) Requirements for presiding officers.-- There shall preside at the taking of evidence the commission, one or more commissioners, or one or more administrative law judges appointed as provided in this chapter. The functions of all presiding officers shall be conducted in an impartial manner. Any such officer may at any time withdraw from a proceeding if he deems himself disqualified, and, upon the filing in good faith of a timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of any such officer, the commission shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the proceeding. (d) Authority of presiding officers.-- In addition to any administrative rules of procedure contained in this part, the commission may adopt and publish such additional rules of procedure as are not inconsistent with this part. Officers presiding at hearings shall have authority subject to the published rules of the commission and within its powers, to: (1) Administer oaths and affirmations. (2) Issue subpoenas authorized by law. (3) Rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence, take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of justice would be served thereby. (4) Regulate the course of the hearing. (5) Require persons requesting to make a statement at a public input hearing to state their name, occupation and place of employment for the record. (6) Hold conferences for settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties. (7) Dispose of procedural requests or similar matters. (8) Make decisions or recommend decisions in conformity within this part. (9) Take any other action authorized by commission rule. (e) Interlocutory appeals.-- A presiding officer may certify to the commission, or allow the parties an interlocutory appeal to the commission on any material question arising in the course of a proceeding, where he finds that it is necessary to do so to prevent substantial prejudice to any party or to expedite the conduct of the proceeding. The presiding officer or the commission may thereafter stay the proceeding if necessary to protect the substantial rights of any of the parties therein. The commission shall determine the question forthwith and the hearing and further decision shall thereafter be governed accordingly. No interlocutory appeal to the commission shall otherwise be allowed, except as may be allowed by the commission. (f) Declaratory orders.-- The commission, with like effect as in the case of other orders, and in its sound discretion, may issue a declaratory order to terminate a controversy or remove uncertainty. (g) Official notice defined.-- As used in this chapter the term \"official notice\" means a method by which the commission may notify all parties that no further evidence will be heard on a material fact and that unless the parties prove to the contrary, the commission's findings will include that particular fact.

(a) Burden of proof.-- Except as may be otherwise provided in section 315 (relating to burden of proof) or other provisions of this part or other relevant statute, the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof. (b) Admissibility of evidence.-- Any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the commission shall as a matter of policy provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. No sanction shall be imposed or rule or order be issued except upon consideration of the whole record or such portions thereof as may be cited by any party and as supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative and substantial evidence. (c) Submission of evidence.-- Every party is entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The commission may, by rule, adopt procedures for the submission of all or part of the evidence in written form. (d) Record, briefs and argument.-- The transcript of a public input hearing, the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, constitutes the exclusive record for decision, and shall be available for inspection by the public. Briefing and oral argument shall be held in accordance with rules established by the commission. For the purpose of this section, a public input hearing is a hearing held in the service area at which the ratepayers may offer testimony, written or otherwise, relating to any matter which has a bearing on the proceeding. (e) Official notice of facts.-- When the commission's decision rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, upon notification that facts are about to be or have been noticed, any party adversely affected shall have the opportunity upon timely request to show that the facts are not properly noticed or that alternative facts should be noticed. The commission in its discretion shall determine whether written presentations suffice, or whether oral argument, oral evidence, or cross-examination is appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the application by the commission in appropriate circumstances of the doctrine of judicial notice. (f) Actions of parties and counsel.-- Any party who shall fail to be represented at a scheduled conference or hearing after being duly notified thereof, shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to participate in such conference or hearing, and shall not be permitted thereafter to reopen the disposition of any matter accomplished thereat, or to recall for further examination of witnesses who were excused, unless the presiding officer shall determine that failure to be represented was unavoidable and that the interests of the other parties and the public would not be prejudiced by permitting such reopening or further examination. If the actions of a party or counsel in a proceeding shall be determined by the commission, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, to be obstructive to the orderly conduct of the proceeding and inimical to the public interest, the commission may reject or dismiss any rule or order in any manner proposed by the offending party or counsel, and, with respect to counsel, may bar further participation by him in any proceedings before the commission. (g) Decision of administrative law judge.-- In all on-the-record proceedings referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) (relating to powers of commission and administrative law judges), hearings shall be commenced by the administrative law judge within 90 days after the proceeding is initiated, and he shall render a decision within 90 days after the record is closed, unless the commission for good cause by order allows an extension not to exceed an additional 90 days. (h) Exceptions and appeal procedure.-- Any party to a proceeding referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) may file exceptions to the decision of the administrative law judge with the commission, in a form and manner and within the time to be prescribed by the commission. The commission shall rule upon such exceptions within 90 days after filing. If no exceptions are filed, the decision shall become final, without further commission action, unless two or more commissioners within 15 days after the decision request that the commission review the decision and make such other order, within 90 days of such request, as it shall determine. The Office of Trial Staff and the chief counsel shall be deemed to have automatic standing as a party to such proceeding and may file exceptions to any decision of the administrative law judge under this subsection. (i) Review of testimony.-- Any party of record in an investigation or inquiry by or hearing before the commission or its representative whose testimony is recorded electronically and subsequently transcribed shall, upon request, be permitted to review the recording to ensure that it has been transcribed accurately. The commission may impose a fee in an amount not exceeding the actual costs involved for making the recording available. Any request to review the recording must be made within the time prescribed by commission regulation, and such request shall not be used to unreasonably delay commission proceedings. This section shall not be construed to require the electronic recording of testimony. The official record of a proceeding shall be the written transcript.

(a) Conferences.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority to hold one or more prehearing conferences during the course of the proceeding on his own motion or at the request of a party to the proceeding. The presiding officer shall normally hold at least one prehearing conference in proceedings where the issues are complex or where it appears likely that the hearing will last a considerable period of time. In addition to other matters which the commission may prescribe by rule, the presiding officer at a prehearing conference may direct the parties to exchange their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists prior to the hearing. Where good cause exists, the parties may at any time amend, by deletion or supplementation, their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists. (b) Depositions.-- A party to the proceeding shall be able to take depositions of witnesses upon oral examination or written questions for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information, subject to the following conditions: (1) The taking of depositions shall normally be deferred until there has been at least one prehearing conference. (2) The party seeking to take a deposition shall apply to the presiding officer for an order to do so. (3) The party seeking to take a deposition shall serve copies of the application on the other party or parties to the proceedings, who shall be given an opportunity, along with the deponent, to notify the presiding officer of any objections to the taking of the deposition. (4) The presiding officer shall not grant an application to take a deposition if he finds that the taking of the deposition would result in undue delay. (5) The presiding officer shall otherwise grant an application to take a deposition unless he finds that there is not good cause for doing so. (6) The deposing of a commission employee shall only be allowed upon an order of the presiding officer based on a specific finding that the party applying to take the deposition is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. Any such order shall be subject to an interlocutory appeal to the commission. (7) An order to take a deposition shall be enforceable through the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum. (c) Disclosure of information on witnesses.-- At the prehearing conference or at some other reasonable time prior to the hearing, which may be established by commission rule, each party to the proceeding shall make available to the other parties to the proceeding the names of the witnesses he expects to call and the subject matter of their expected testimony. Where good cause exists, the parties shall have the right at any time to amend, by deletion or supplementation, the list of names of the witnesses they plan to call and the subject matter of the expected testimony of those witnesses. (d) Interrogatories.-- Any party to a proceeding may serve written interrogatories upon any other party for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information. A party served with interrogatories may, before the time prescribed either by commission rule or otherwise for answering the interrogatories, apply to the presiding officer for the holding of a prehearing conference for the mutual exchange of evidence exhibits and other information. Each interrogatory which requests information not previously supplied at a prehearing conference or hearing shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for the objections shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections within a reasonable time, unless otherwise specified, upon the party submitting the interrogatories. The party submitting the interrogatories may petition the presiding officer for an order compelling an answer to an interrogatory or interrogatories to which there has been an objection or other failure to answer. The commission shall designate an appropriate official, other than the Director of Trial Staff or any other employee of the Office of Trial Staff, on whom other parties to the proceeding may serve written interrogatories directed to the commission. That official shall arrange for agency personnel with knowledge of the facts to answer and sign the interrogatories on behalf of the commission. Interrogatories directed to the commission shall be allowed only upon an order of the commission based upon a specific finding that the interrogating party is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. When participating in a commission proceeding, the Office of Trial Staff shall be subject to the same rules of discovery applicable to any other party to the case. (e) Requests for admissions.-- A party to a proceeding may serve upon any other party and upon the commission to the same extent permissible in subsection (d) a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding and to conserve hearing time, of any relevant, unprivileged, undisputed facts, the genuineness of any document described in the request, the admissibility of evidence, the order of proof and other similar matters. (f) Subpoena duces tecum.-- A party to a proceeding may obtain in accordance with commission rules a subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of or the making available for inspection, copying or photographing of relevant necessary designated documents at a prehearing conference or other specific time and place. (g) Scheduling.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority to impose schedules on the parties to the proceeding specifying the periods of time during which the parties may pursue each means of discovery available to them under the rules of the commission. Such schedules and time periods shall be set with a view to accelerating disposition of the case to the fullest extent consistent with fairness. (h) Certification of interlocutory appeals.-- Except as provided in subsection (b)(6), an interlocutory appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer on discovery shall be allowed only upon certification by the presiding officer that the ruling involves an important question of law or policy which should be resolved at that time. Notwithstanding the presiding officer's certification, the commission shall have the authority to dismiss summarily the interlocutory appeal if it should appear that the certification was improvident. An interlocutory appeal shall not result in a stay of the proceedings except upon a finding by the presiding officer and the commission that extraordinary circumstances exist. (i) Protective orders.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority, upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, to make any order, subject to the rules of the commission, which justice requires to protect the party or person. (j) Other subpoenas.-- The presiding officer shall have the power in accordance with commission rules to issue subpoenas ad testificandum and duces tecum at any time during the course of the proceeding.

(a) Staggered renewal system to be established.-- The department shall establish a system of staggered registration renewal in a manner that an approximately equal number of registrations will expire every month throughout the year. In order to implement and maintain the staggered registration system, the department may prorate annual registration fees over registration periods of from 6 to 18 months. (a.1) Seasonal registration.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a passenger car, recreational motor vehicle, motorcycle, truck or farm vehicle which does not have a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 14,000 pounds may register the vehicle with the department for a period of successive months of less than one year. The applicant shall specify the period of months during which the vehicle shall be registered. Except when the department initially converts a currently valid annual registration to a seasonal registration, the annual fee prescribed for the vehicle by Chapter 19 (relating to fees) shall be paid in full by the applicant regardless of the number of months chosen for registration by the applicant. Upon receipt of the appropriate fee and the properly completed form, including all information required by this chapter, the department shall issue a seasonal registration that shall expire on the last day of the expiration month chosen by the registrant. No insurer of a vehicle belonging to any owner or lessee who obtains a seasonal registration and who applies for or receives a reduced automobile insurance premium on account thereof shall be required to provide any contractual coverage, whether in the form of the provision of a defense or the payment of first-party or third-party benefits or otherwise, to the owner or lessee in connection with any event occurring during that part of the year in which the vehicle is not registered; and such owner or lessee shall be treated for all purposes, including, without limitation, ascertaining rights to stack coverages and to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, as a person who does not own that vehicle and has no duty to carry financial responsibility on it for that part of the year. (b) New registration.-- A new registration is effective on the date of issuance of a registration card by the department or the date of issuance of a temporary registration card by an authorized agent of the department under section 1310 (relating to temporary registration cards). (c) Renewal of registration.-- A renewed registration shall be effective on issuance by the department of a renewed registration card. (d) Expiration of registration.-- A registration shall expire on the last day of the month designated on the registration card. (e) Antique, classic and collectible vehicles.-- Antique, classic and collectible motor vehicle registrations shall expire upon the salvaging, scrapping or transfer of ownership of the vehicle, except that if the transfer is between spouses or between parent and child the registration may be transferred upon payment of a transfer fee. (f) Optional permanent trailer registration.-- Except as set forth in section 1920(c) (relating to trailers), the registration of trailers permanently registered as provided in section 1920(c) shall expire upon salvaging of the vehicle or transfer of ownership. (g) Election.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a motor vehicle, except a motor vehicle registered under the International Registration Plan and a motor vehicle with a seasonal registration or a circus or carnival plate, may elect to pay an annual registration fee for a two-year period. The fee shall be two times the amount of the registration fee otherwise payable for the motor vehicle under this title.

      "text": "§ 1317.2. Gaming service provider. (a) Development of classification system.-- The board shall develop a classification system governing the certification, registration and regulation of gaming service providers and individuals and entities associated with them.

(2) Whether the employees of the gaming service provider will have access to the gaming floor or any gaming-related restricted area of a licensed facility. (3) The board's analysis of the goods or services provided or to be provided by the gaming service provider. (b) Authority to exempt.-- The board may exempt any person or type of business from the requirements of this section if the board determines: (1) the person or type of business is regulated by an agency of the Federal Government, an agency of the Commonwealth or the Pennsylvania Supreme Court; or (2) the regulation of the person or type of business is determined not to be necessary in order to protect the public interest or the integrity of gaming.

(2) Cooperate with the board in investigations, hearings and enforcement and disciplinary actions.

(f) Construction.-- Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the board from rescinding a grant of interim authorization if, at any time, the suitability of the person subject to interim authorization is at issue or if the person fails to cooperate with the board, the bureau or an agent of the board or bureau. (g) Gaming service provider lists.-- The board shall: (1) Develop and maintain a list of approved gaming service providers who are authorized to provide goods or services whether under a grant of interim or continued authorization.

(h) Emergency authorization.-- A slot machine licensee may utilize a gaming service provider that has not been approved by the board when a threat to public health, welfare or safety exists or circumstances outside the control of the slot machine licensee require immediate action to mitigate damage or loss to the licensee's licensed facility or to the Commonwealth. The board shall promulgate regulations to govern the use of gaming service providers under emergency circumstances. The regulations shall include a requirement that the slot machine licensee contact the board immediately upon utilizing a gaming service provider that has not been approved by the board. (i) Criminal history record information.-- If the classification system developed by the board in accordance with subsection (a) requires a gaming service provider or an individual or entity associated with the gaming service provider to submit to or provide the bureau with criminal history record information under 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 91 (relating to criminal history record information), the bureau shall notify a slot machine licensee that submitted a certification under subsection (e)(2) whether the applicant has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor gambling offense.

(c) SURE system.-- After a commission is connected to the SURE system, the general register of the commission shall consist of the registration information contained on the SURE system as maintained by the commission. (d) Registration cards.-- Before a commission is connected to the SURE system, if a commission uses the original registration cards for registered electors in the county as the district register, the duplicate registration cards or photocopies of the original registration cards shall be placed in exact alphabetical order by last name of the registrant, shall be indexed and shall be kept at the office of the registration commission in a manner as to be properly safeguarded. These cards constitute the general register of the county. They may not be removed from the office of the commission except upon order of a court of record. Nothing in this part shall preclude the use of duplicate registration cards from applications provided under the act of March 30, 1937 (P.L.115, No.40), known as The First Class City Permanent Registration Act, or the act of April 29, 1937 (P.L.487, No.115), known as The Permanent Registration Act for Cities of the Second Class, Cities of the Second Class A, Cities of the Third Class, Boroughs, Towns, and Townships.

(f) Duplicate files.-- Before a commission is connected to the SURE system, if the commission deems a duplicate file of registration cards necessary for administrative purposes, the commission may prepare a reproduction in compliance with the following: (1) The registration form shall be photographed, microphotographed or reproduced in a manner approved for permanent records by the secretary. (2) The device used to reproduce the card is one which accurately reproduces the original in all details.

The keys to the binders shall at all times be retained by the commission. (4) The district register shall be kept at the office of the commission except as provided in subsection (b) and shall be open to public inspection, subject to reasonable safeguards and regulations. (b) Computer lists.-- (1) Before a commission is connected to the SURE system, instead of using registration cards as the district register as provided in subsection (a), a commission may use a computer list or computer-generated cards containing the registered electors arranged by election district, alphabetically by last name of the registrant. The computer list or computer-generated cards must be in a form prescribed by the secretary and must contain necessary information that would otherwise be available on the registration cards, including a legible digitized signature of the registrant copied from the signature on the registration card. The district election officials shall have computer printouts at the polling places containing the necessary information needed to verify the identity of the elector. The digitized signature list shall be open to public inspection, subject to reasonable safeguards, rules and regulations. (2) After a commission is connected to the SURE system, each commission shall create from its general register a computer list to be used as the district register. For each election district, the list shall contain the names of the registered electors of the election district, alphabetically by last name of each registered elector. Each page of the list shall contain the name of the county, the election district, the date of the election and the date and time the list was prepared. The computer list shall be in a form prescribed by the secretary and must contain necessary information that would otherwise be available in the general register, including a legible digitized or electronic signature, the street address and political party of each registered elector, and suitable space for insertion of the signature of the registered elector and for insertion by the proper election official of the number and letter of the stub of the ballot issued to the registered elector or the registered elector's number in the order of admission to the voting systems and the initials of the election official who enters the record of voting in the district register and whether the elector needs assistance to vote and, if so, the nature of the disability. The district register shall be kept at the office of the commission and shall be open to public inspection, subject to reasonable safeguards, rules and regulations. (3) Before connection to the SURE system, a commission may, during systems conversion periods or emergency conditions, provide for a district register containing the original registration cards. The following apply: (i) The original registration cards shall be filed by election district in one of the following orders as determined by the commission: (A) Exact alphabetical order by last name of registrant. (B) Order in which registrants' residences appear upon the streets of the election district, in exact alphabetical order by last name of registrant for each residence. (ii) The district register containing registration cards shall be kept at the office of the commission and shall be open for public inspection, subject to reasonable safeguards and regulations and to the provisions of this part. (c) Accuracy.-- It is the duty of the commission to compare and correct the general register and district registers to ensure their accuracy. By noon of the third day preceding an election, the commission shall correct the district register for each election district consistent with the information contained in the general register. (d) Delivery.-- The commission shall deliver, in the manner required by law for delivery of election materials, the district register to the election officers for use on election day. (e) Form.-- District registers shall be enclosed within a case or container and shall be locked and sealed by the commission before delivery. The district register shall have printed or written thereon the words \"District Register of Electors\" and the district and ward, if any.

The commission specifically shall compare the signature of each elector on each voter's certificate with his signature in the district register and shall report in writing to the district attorney any evidence or indication of probable fraud, impersonation or forgery which may appear to the commission by reason of the comparison. In the case of any elector whom the election officers shall have recorded as removed, deceased or challenged and prevented from voting, the commission shall ascertain the facts and shall correct the general and district registers in accordance with Chapter 15 (relating to changes in records).

(3) The department and the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall enter into an agreement whereby the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall reimburse the Motor License Fund for the department's actual costs of the issuance of a veteran's designation on drivers' licenses and identification cards.

It shall be a defense to a prosecution under this subsection that the person was not presented with notice of the provisions of this subsection. (f) Waiver.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the department shall issue a driver's license to an otherwise eligible person who has no Social Security number if the person submits a waiver obtained from the Federal Government permitting him not to have a Social Security number. The department may require other identifiers, including, but not limited to, a taxpayer identification number, before issuing the license. (g) Completion of process.-- (1) For purposes of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-31, 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg et seq.), this subsection applies to statutes requiring determination of completion of the licensing process. (2) The process of issuing a driver's license is complete when a license bearing the licensee's photograph, photographic facsimile or image has been issued by the department.

(a) Eligible applicants.-- The following may apply for financial assistance for operating expenses under this section: (1) The governing body of a municipality or an instrumentality of a municipality. (2) A Commonwealth agency or instrumentality. (3) A local transportation organization. (b) Applications.-- In addition to information required under section 1507 (relating to application and approval process), an application for financial assistance under this section shall include the applicant's reasonable estimates of operating revenue and government subsidies sufficient to cover all projected operating expenses. (c) Distribution formula.-- (1) No later than 15 business days after the effective date of this section, the department shall forward to the Legislative Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin the base operating allocation for each local transportation organization. (1.1) For purposes of determining the amount of assistance available for distribution under this subsection, in addition to the amounts allocated under section 1506(e)(1)(relating to fund), an amount equal to the revenue in the Public Transportation Assistance Fund dedicated pursuant to law shall be included. (2) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, each qualifying local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance which shall consist of the following: (i) Its base operating allocation multiplied by 1.0506. (ii) An additional amount which shall be allocated based on the following distribution formula: (A) Twenty-five percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of passengers. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.25. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of passengers. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of passengers for all local transportation organizations. (B) Ten percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of senior passengers to offset free fares for senior passengers. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.10. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of senior passengers. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of senior passengers for all local transportation organizations. (C) Thirty-five percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of revenue vehicle hours. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.35. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of revenue vehicle hours. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total of the revenue vehicle hours for all local transportation organizations. (D) Thirty percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of revenue vehicle miles. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.30. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of revenue vehicle miles. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of revenue vehicle miles for all local transportation organizations. (3) For the 2007-2008 fiscal year, no local transportation organization shall receive total financial assistance under this subsection that would be more than 50% higher than the amount it receives under paragraph (2)(i). For each subsequent fiscal year, the increase in the total financial assistance provided to each local transportation organization shall not exceed 20% of the prior year allocation. (c.1) Minimum.-- No local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance under this section in an amount less than the amount received in the previous fiscal year. (d) Local match requirements.-- (1) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, except as provided under paragraph (2), financial assistance provided under this section shall be matched by local or private cash funding in an amount not less than the greater of: (i) 15% of the amount of the financial assistance being provided; or (ii) the amount required under former section 1311(d) (relating to use of funds distributed) for fiscal year 2006-2007. (2) Beginning in fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, if the local matching funds provided are less than 15% of the amount of financial assistance received, the local transportation organization's required local matching funds shall increase annually in order to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). The local matching funds shall be increased annually by a minimum of 5% above the amount of local matching funds provided in the previous fiscal year unless a lesser amount is necessary to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). (3) Eligible local matching funds shall consist only of cash contributions provided by one or more municipalities or counties. The amount of the match and the time period during which the match must continue to be available shall be specified in the financial assistance agreement. Funding provided by local and private entities, including advertising or naming rights, may qualify as local matching funds to the extent they provide for the cost of transit service that is open to the public. The following shall not be considered local matching funds: (i) Any form of transit operating revenue or other forms of transit income provided by the local transportation organization. (ii) Funds used to replace fares. (4) A municipality in a metropolitan area which is a member of a local transportation organization is authorized to provide annual financial assistance from current revenues to the local transportation organization of which it is a member or enter into a long-term agreement for payment of money to assist in defraying the costs of operation, maintenance and debt service of the local transportation organization or of a particular public transportation project of a local transportation organization. The obligation of a municipality under an agreement pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered to be a part of the indebtedness of the municipality, nor shall the obligation be deemed to impair the status of any indebtedness of the municipality which would otherwise be considered self-sustaining. (e) Performance reviews.-- (1) The department may conduct performance reviews of an award recipient under this section to determine the effectiveness of the financial assistance. Reviews shall be conducted at regular intervals as established by the department in consultation with the management of the award recipient. After completion of a review, the department shall issue a report that: (i) highlights exceptional performance and identifies any problems that need to be resolved; (ii) assesses performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of the financial assistance; (iii) makes recommendations on follow-up actions required to remedy any problem identified; and (iv) provides an action plan documenting who should perform the recommended actions and a time frame within which they should be performed. (2) The department shall deliver the report to the Governor, to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the Senate and to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives. The department's regulations shall contain a description of the impact on both the amount of, and future eligibility for, financial assistance under this chapter based upon the degree to which the local transportation organization complies with the recommendations in the report. The department shall develop a list of best practices revealed by the reports issued under this subsection and shall post them on the department's Internet website. (f) Performance criteria.-- Criteria used for the reviews conducted under subsection (e) shall consist of passengers per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per revenue vehicle hour, operating revenue per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per passenger and other items as the department may establish. The department's regulations shall set forth the minimum system performance criteria based upon comparison of the award recipient to its past performance and to its peers that an award recipient must satisfy. (g) Failure to satisfy minimum performance criteria.-- (1) If a performance review conducted under subsection (e) reveals that the performance of an award recipient's transportation system has decreased compared to performance determined through a prior review, the department may, upon the written request of an award recipient, waive any requirement for a reduction in the amount of financial assistance to be awarded under this section for a reasonable time period to allow the award recipient to bring the system back to the required performance level. The award recipient shall provide written justification for providing a time period longer than two years. In order to obtain the waiver for the period requested, the award recipient must do all of the following: (i) Develop an action plan to improve system performance that contains key measurable milestones. The action plan must be acceptable to the department and must be approved by the department in writing. (ii) Submit quarterly progress reports on the action plan to the department. (2) The department shall review and evaluate the award recipient's progress to determine if the system has improved. If the system has improved, the award recipient will remain eligible for full formula funding as determined under subsection (c). If the system has not improved by the end of the waiver period, the waiver will be withdrawn. Expenses incurred by the award recipient as a result of the failure of the award recipient's system to meet the minimum performance criteria shall be borne by the award recipient. (h) Adjustments to minimum performance criteria.-- Upon written request of an award recipient, the department may adjust the minimum performance criteria described in subsection (g) in a given year if the performance of the award recipient's system is adversely affected by circumstances which are beyond the award recipient's control. Examples are labor strikes, infrastructure failures and natural disasters. The request must include the award recipient's reasons for seeking the adjustment. Cross References.

Unless the licensee was a commercial driver at the time of the violation, the department shall maintain records or make notations only for convictions that are relevant to the licensee's operating privilege. Where the licensee was a commercial driver at the time of the violation, the department shall maintain records or make notations for all convictions of any violation, in any motor vehicle, of a State or local traffic control law, except a parking violation, and also for any other convictions that are relevant to the licensee's operating privilege.

(c) Dismissal of charges for violations.-- If a charge for violation of any of the provisions of this title against any person is dismissed where there have been no prior convictions by any court of competent jurisdiction, no record of the charge and dismissal shall be included in the driving record of the person. If the person has been previously convicted of the charge and suspension was imposed by the department, which suspension was either partially or fully served, the department may keep a record of the offense for the purpose of showing the suspension was imposed against the person, but the offense shall not be used for the purpose of calculating the requisite number of offenses under section 1542 (relating to revocation of habitual offender's license). In addition, the department may keep records of charges that have been filed with the courts in order to determine a person's eligibility for a probationary license under the provisions of section 1554(b)(3) (relating to probationary license). All records maintained pursuant to this subsection shall be maintained for administrative and law enforcement use only and shall not be released for any other purpose, except where the person was a commercial driver at the time of the violation and the charge was dismissed as part of the person's acceptance of Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition. (d) Updating driving record.-- Drivers wishing to have their record reviewed by the department may make such a request in order that the record be brought up to date. In updating records, the department shall include recalculation of suspension or revocation segments and the assignment and crediting of any suspension or revocation time previously assigned or credited toward a suspension or revocation which resulted from a conviction which has been vacated, overturned, dismissed or withdrawn. Any fully or partially served suspension or revocation time may only be reassigned or credited toward a suspension or revocation segment processed on the driver's record as of the actual commencement date of the fully or partially served suspension or revocation time.

The petition shall request that the court enter a rule upon the agency to show cause why the agency should not be directed to disclose to the bureau, or identified agents thereof, information in its possession about any pending matter under the jurisdiction of the bureau pursuant to this part. If a respondent is a local agency, a copy of any rule issued pursuant to this section shall be provided to the district attorney of the county in which the local agency is located and the Office of Attorney General. Upon request of a local agency, the district attorney or the Attorney General may elect to enter an appearance to represent the local agency in the proceedings.

(c) Court determination.-- Following review of the record, the court shall grant the relief sought by the director of the Office of Enforcement Counsel if the court determines that the agency has in its possession information material to the investigation or inquiry and that disclosure or release of the information is in the best interest of the Commonwealth, that the disclosure or release of the information is not otherwise prohibited by statute or regulation and that the disclosure or release of the information would not inhibit an agency in the performance of the agency's duties. If the court so determines, the court shall enter an order authorizing and directing the information be made available for review in camera. (d) Release of materials or information.-- If, after an in camera review by the court, the director of the Office of Enforcement Counsel seeks to obtain copies of materials in the agency's possession, the court may, if not otherwise prohibited by statute or regulation, enter an order that the requested materials be provided.

(e) Modification of order.-- If subsequent investigation or inquiry by the bureau warrants modification of any order entered pursuant to this section, the director of the Office of Enforcement Counsel may petition to request the modification. Upon such request, the court may modify its orders at any time and in any manner it deems necessary and appropriate. The agency named in the original petition shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

(b.1) Offenses involving out-of-service orders and a bus or hazardous materials.-- The department shall disqualify any person for two years for a first violation of operating a commercial motor vehicle while the driver or vehicle is subject to an out-of-service order if the violation occurred either while transporting a hazardous material required to be placarded, or while operating a vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver.

(b) Existing cooperatives.-- Except as provided in subsection (c), sections 4106, 4107, 4203 (relating to construction and validity of declaration and bylaws), 4219 (relating to master associations), 4220 (relating to merger or consolidation of cooperatives), 4302(a)(1) through (6) and (11) through (17) (relating to powers of association), 4311 (relating to tort and contract liability), 4315 (relating to lien for assessments), 4317 (relating to association records), 4319 (relating to termination of cooperative interest), 4409 (relating to resales of cooperative interests) and 4415 (relating to effect of violations on rights of action), and section 4103 (relating to definitions) to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subpart and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. By compliance with the requirements of section 4201 (relating to creation of cooperative ownership), a cooperative created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart may be made subject to all of the provisions of this subpart, effective as of the date of recordation of the document or documents specified in section 4201, without in any way terminating the cooperative status of the property or in any way affecting any lien or encumbrance on the property, if the terms of such document or documents have been approved by all the persons whose actions would have been required to effect the termination of the cooperative pursuant to its governing documents in effect at the time such approval is given, provided, however, that such action shall not increase the obligations or responsibilities of a declarant, as such and not as a proprietary lessee, without the joinder of the declarant in the document or documents required by section 4201.

(d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart. (2) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made pursuant to this subpart.

(b) Admissibility of evidence.-- Any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the commission shall as a matter of policy provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. No sanction shall be imposed or rule or order be issued except upon consideration of the whole record or such portions thereof as may be cited by any party and as supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative and substantial evidence. (c) Submission of evidence.-- Every party is entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The commission may, by rule, adopt procedures for the submission of all or part of the evidence in written form. (d) Record, briefs and argument.-- The transcript of a public input hearing, the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, constitutes the exclusive record for decision, and shall be available for inspection by the public.

(e) Official notice of facts.-- When the commission's decision rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, upon notification that facts are about to be or have been noticed, any party adversely affected shall have the opportunity upon timely request to show that the facts are not properly noticed or that alternative facts should be noticed. The commission in its discretion shall determine whether written presentations suffice, or whether oral argument, oral evidence, or cross-examination is appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the application by the commission in appropriate circumstances of the doctrine of judicial notice. (f) Actions of parties and counsel.-- Any party who shall fail to be represented at a scheduled conference or hearing after being duly notified thereof, shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to participate in such conference or hearing, and shall not be permitted thereafter to reopen the disposition of any matter accomplished thereat, or to recall for further examination of witnesses who were excused, unless the presiding officer shall determine that failure to be represented was unavoidable and that the interests of the other parties and the public would not be prejudiced by permitting such reopening or further examination. If the actions of a party or counsel in a proceeding shall be determined by the commission, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, to be obstructive to the orderly conduct of the proceeding and inimical to the public interest, the commission may reject or dismiss any rule or order in any manner proposed by the offending party or counsel, and, with respect to counsel, may bar further participation by him in any proceedings before the commission. (g) Decision of administrative law judge.-- In all on-the-record proceedings referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) (relating to powers of commission and administrative law judges), hearings shall be commenced by the administrative law judge within 90 days after the proceeding is initiated, and he shall render a decision within 90 days after the record is closed, unless the commission for good cause by order allows an extension not to exceed an additional 90 days. (h) Exceptions and appeal procedure.-- Any party to a proceeding referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) may file exceptions to the decision of the administrative law judge with the commission, in a form and manner and within the time to be prescribed by the commission. The commission shall rule upon such exceptions within 90 days after filing. If no exceptions are filed, the decision shall become final, without further commission action, unless two or more commissioners within 15 days after the decision request that the commission review the decision and make such other order, within 90 days of such request, as it shall determine. The Office of Trial Staff and the chief counsel shall be deemed to have automatic standing as a party to such proceeding and may file exceptions to any decision of the administrative law judge under this subsection.

The commission may impose a fee in an amount not exceeding the actual costs involved for making the recording available.

      "text": "§ 333. Prehearing procedures. (a) Conferences.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority to hold one or more prehearing conferences during the course of the proceeding on his own motion or at the request of a party to the proceeding. The presiding officer shall normally hold at least one prehearing conference in proceedings where the issues are complex or where it appears likely that the hearing will last a considerable period of time. In addition to other matters which the commission may prescribe by rule, the presiding officer at a prehearing conference may direct the parties to exchange their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists prior to the hearing. Where good cause exists, the parties may at any time amend, by deletion or supplementation, their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists. (b) Depositions.-- A party to the proceeding shall be able to take depositions of witnesses upon oral examination or written questions for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information, subject to the following conditions: (1) The taking of depositions shall normally be deferred until there has been at least one prehearing conference. (2) The party seeking to take a deposition shall apply to the presiding officer for an order to do so. (3) The party seeking to take a deposition shall serve copies of the application on the other party or parties to the proceedings, who shall be given an opportunity, along with the deponent, to notify the presiding officer of any objections to the taking of the deposition. (4) The presiding officer shall not grant an application to take a deposition if he finds that the taking of the deposition would result in undue delay. (5) The presiding officer shall otherwise grant an application to take a deposition unless he finds that there is not good cause for doing so. (6) The deposing of a commission employee shall only be allowed upon an order of the presiding officer based on a specific finding that the party applying to take the deposition is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. Any such order shall be subject to an interlocutory appeal to the commission. (7) An order to take a deposition shall be enforceable through the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum. (c) Disclosure of information on witnesses.-- At the prehearing conference or at some other reasonable time prior to the hearing, which may be established by commission rule, each party to the proceeding shall make available to the other parties to the proceeding the names of the witnesses he expects to call and the subject matter of their expected testimony. Where good cause exists, the parties shall have the right at any time to amend, by deletion or supplementation, the list of names of the witnesses they plan to call and the subject matter of the expected testimony of those witnesses. (d) Interrogatories.-- Any party to a proceeding may serve written interrogatories upon any other party for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information. A party served with interrogatories may, before the time prescribed either by commission rule or otherwise for answering the interrogatories, apply to the presiding officer for the holding of a prehearing conference for the mutual exchange of evidence exhibits and other information. Each interrogatory which requests information not previously supplied at a prehearing conference or hearing shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for the objections shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections within a reasonable time, unless otherwise specified, upon the party submitting the interrogatories. The party submitting the interrogatories may petition the presiding officer for an order compelling an answer to an interrogatory or interrogatories to which there has been an objection or other failure to answer. The commission shall designate an appropriate official, other than the Director of Trial Staff or any other employee of the Office of Trial Staff, on whom other parties to the proceeding may serve written interrogatories directed to the commission. That official shall arrange for agency personnel with knowledge of the facts to answer and sign the interrogatories on behalf of the commission. Interrogatories directed to the commission shall be allowed only upon an order of the commission based upon a specific finding that the interrogating party is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. When participating in a commission proceeding, the Office of Trial Staff shall be subject to the same rules of discovery applicable to any other party to the case. (e) Requests for admissions.-- A party to a proceeding may serve upon any other party and upon the commission to the same extent permissible in subsection (d) a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding and to conserve hearing time, of any relevant, unprivileged, undisputed facts, the genuineness of any document described in the request, the admissibility of evidence, the order of proof and other similar matters. (f) Subpoena duces tecum.-- A party to a proceeding may obtain in accordance with commission rules a subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of or the making available for inspection, copying or photographing of relevant necessary designated documents at a prehearing conference or other specific time and place. (g) Scheduling.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority to impose schedules on the parties to the proceeding specifying the periods of time during which the parties may pursue each means of discovery available to them under the rules of the commission. Such schedules and time periods shall be set with a view to accelerating disposition of the case to the fullest extent consistent with fairness. (h) Certification of interlocutory appeals.-- Except as provided in subsection (b)(6), an interlocutory appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer on discovery shall be allowed only upon certification by the presiding officer that the ruling involves an important question of law or policy which should be resolved at that time. Notwithstanding the presiding officer's certification, the commission shall have the authority to dismiss summarily the interlocutory appeal if it should appear that the certification was improvident. An interlocutory appeal shall not result in a stay of the proceedings except upon a finding by the presiding officer and the commission that extraordinary circumstances exist. (i) Protective orders.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority, upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, to make any order, subject to the rules of the commission, which justice requires to protect the party or person. (j) Other subpoenas.-- The presiding officer shall have the power in accordance with commission rules to issue subpoenas ad testificandum and duces tecum at any time during the course of the proceeding.

Slot machine licensees shall be required to update the information in their initial applications annually, and the license of a licensee in good standing shall be renewed every five years.

This credit shall be applied on a dollar-for-dollar basis as and when the tax is payable as set forth in section 1403 but shall not extend beyond the ten-year period following the initial issuance of the license. The aggregate amount of all credits provided shall not exceed the amount of the licensing fee paid by the licensee.

(iv) In the ninth year, each Category 1 and Category 2 slot machine licensee shall be entitled to a partial return of the one-time slot machine license fee in the amount of $16,666,668. (v) In the tenth year, each Category 1 and Category 2 slot machine licensee shall be entitled to a partial return of the one-time machine license fee in the amount of $8,333,334. (2.1) In the event that the General Assembly acts in the manner described in paragraph (1) after the expiration of ten years, Category 1 and Category 2 slot machine licensees shall not be entitled to a return of any portion of the one-time slot machine license fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no slot machine licensee shall be entitled to the return of any portion of the fee as a result of any act of the General Assembly insofar as it implements a recommendation made by the board pursuant to a qualified majority vote. In the event a full or partial return of the slot machine license fee imposed pursuant to subsection (a) becomes due pursuant to this subsection, the amount to be returned to any slot machine licensee shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the total accumulated tax credits granted to such licensee pursuant to subsection (c). In no event shall the total amount of the slot machine license fee returned to a Category 1 or Category 2 licensee, combined with the total tax credits granted, exceed the amounts set forth in this subsection for any licensee. The total or partial return of the slot machine license fee shall extinguish a licensee's right to claim any further tax credits pursuant to subsection (c) and to make any future claim for the return of the slot machine license fee. (3) Within ten days following a determination that a slot machine licensee is entitled to the return of any portion of the slot machine license fee paid by the slot machine licensee based on the provisions of this section or based on the contract executed by the slot machine licensee and the department under subsection (c), the board shall immediately assess a one-time slot machine license renewal fee on the slot machine licensee in an amount equal to the amount of the fee returned to the slot machine licensee.

By noon of the third day preceding an election, the commission shall correct the district register for each election district consistent with the information contained in the general register. (d) Delivery.-- The commission shall deliver, in the manner required by law for delivery of election materials, the district register to the election officers for use on election day.

The petition shall request that the court enter a rule upon the agency to show cause why the agency should not be directed to disclose to the bureau, or identified agents thereof, information in its possession about any pending matter under the jurisdiction of the bureau pursuant to this part. If a respondent is a local agency, a copy of any rule issued pursuant to this section shall be provided to the district attorney of the county in which the local agency is located and the Office of Attorney General. Upon request of a local agency, the district attorney or the Attorney General may elect to enter an appearance to represent the local agency in the proceedings. (b) Procedure.-- The filing of a petition pursuant to this section and related proceedings shall be in accordance with court rule, including issuance as of course. A party to the proceeding shall not disclose the filing of a petition or answer or the receipt, content or disposition of a rule or order issued pursuant to this section without leave of court. Any party to the proceedings may request that the record be sealed and proceedings be closed. The court shall grant the request if it is in the best interest of any person or the Commonwealth to do so. (c) Court determination.-- Following review of the record, the court shall grant the relief sought by the director of the Office of Enforcement Counsel if the court determines that the agency has in its possession information material to the investigation or inquiry and that disclosure or release of the information is in the best interest of the Commonwealth, that the disclosure or release of the information is not otherwise prohibited by statute or regulation and that the disclosure or release of the information would not inhibit an agency in the performance of the agency's duties. If the court so determines, the court shall enter an order authorizing and directing the information be made available for review in camera. (d) Release of materials or information.-- If, after an in camera review by the court, the director of the Office of Enforcement Counsel seeks to obtain copies of materials in the agency's possession, the court may, if not otherwise prohibited by statute or regulation, enter an order that the requested materials be provided. Any order authorizing the release of materials or other information shall contain direction regarding the safekeeping and use of the materials or other information sufficient to satisfy the court that the materials or information will be sufficiently safeguarded. In making this determination the court shall consider the input of the agency in possession of the information and any input from any agency with which the information originated concerning any pending investigation or ongoing matter and the safety of person and property. (e) Modification of order.-- If subsequent investigation or inquiry by the bureau warrants modification of any order entered pursuant to this section, the director of the Office of Enforcement Counsel may petition to request the modification. Upon such request, the court may modify its orders at any time and in any manner it deems necessary and appropriate. The agency named in the original petition shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard. (f) Use of information or materials.-- Any person who, by any means authorized by this section, has obtained knowledge of information or materials solely pursuant to this section may use such information or materials in a manner consistent with any directions imposed by the court and appropriate to the proper performance of the person's official duties under this part. (g) Violation.-- In addition to any remedies and penalties provided in this part, any violation of the provisions of this section may be punished as contempt of the court.
