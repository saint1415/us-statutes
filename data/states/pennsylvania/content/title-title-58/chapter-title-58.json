(a) Monitoring competitive conditions.-- The commission shall monitor the market for the supply and distribution of electricity to retail customers and take steps as set forth in this section to prevent anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct and the unlawful exercise of market power. (b) Initiation of investigations.-- Upon complaint or upon its own motion for good cause shown, the commission shall conduct an investigation of the impact on the proper functioning of a fully competitive retail electricity market, including the effect of mergers, consolidations, acquisition or disposition of assets or securities of electricity suppliers, transmission congestion and anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct affecting the retail distribution of electricity. (c) Conduct of investigations.-- (1) The commission may require an electricity supplier to provide information, including documents and testimony, in accordance with the commission's regulations regarding the discovery of information from any electricity supplier. (2) Confidential, proprietary or trade secret information provided under this subsection shall not be disclosed to any person not directly employed or retained by the commission to conduct the investigation without the consent of the party providing the information. (3) Notwithstanding the prohibition on disclosure of information in paragraph (2), the commission shall disclose information obtained under this subsection to the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate under an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The commission may disclose the information to appropriate Federal or State law enforcement officials if it determines that the disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent or restrain a violation of Federal or State law and it provides the party that provided the information with reasonable notice and opportunity to prevent or limit disclosure. (d) Referrals and intervention.-- If, as a result of an investigation conducted under this section, the commission has reason to believe that anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, is preventing the retail electricity customers in this Commonwealth from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market, the commission, pursuant to its regulations, shall: (1) Refer its findings to the Attorney General, the United States Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. (2) Subject to subsection (c)(3), disclose any information it has obtained in the course of its investigation to the agency or agencies to which it has made a referral under paragraph (1). (3) Intervene, as provided and permitted by law or regulation, in any proceedings initiated as a result of a referral made under paragraph (1). (e) Approval of proposed mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or dispositions.-- (1) In the exercise of authority the commission otherwise may have to approve the mergers or consolidations by electric utilities or electricity suppliers, or the acquisition or disposition of assets or securities of other public utilities or electricity suppliers, the commission shall consider whether the proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition is likely to result in anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, which will prevent retail electricity customers in this Commonwealth from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market. (2) Upon request for approval, the commission shall provide notice and an opportunity for open, public evidentiary hearings. If the commission finds, after hearing, that a proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition is likely to result in anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, which will prevent retail electricity customers in this Commonwealth from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market, the commission shall not approve such proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition, except upon such terms and conditions as it finds necessary to preserve the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market. (e.1) Market misconduct.-- (1) If an electric distribution company or any of its affiliated companies or any company that an electric distribution company has purchased generation from is found guilty of market manipulation, exercising market power or collusion by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or any Federal or State court or, if an electric distribution company or any one of its affiliated companies or any company that an electric distribution company has purchased generation from settles a claim of market manipulation, exercising market power or collusion that is brought by a regional transmission operator's market monitoring unit, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or another entity, the commission: (i) Shall direct the electric distribution company to take any and all reasonable action to quantify the effect of the market misconduct upon Pennsylvania ratepayers. (ii) Following public hearing on the matter and a finding of public interest, may direct the electric distribution company to take any and all reasonable legal action, including the filing of a lawsuit as may be necessary, to recover the quantified damages which shall be used to recompense Pennsylvania ratepayers affected by the market misconduct. (2) If the electric distribution company fails to pursue reasonable action to quantify or seek recovery of damages for Pennsylvania ratepayers affected by market manipulation, the exercise of market power or collusion, the commission is authorized, following notice and an opportunity of the electric distribution company to comply or contest, to assess a civil penalty, which shall not be recovered in rates, of not more than $10,000 per day for failure or neglect to obey an order of the commission, the continuance of the failure or neglect being a separate offense. (3) Any monetary damages recovered by the electric distribution company shall be paid to affected Pennsylvania ratepayers in the form of a credit to their electric bills or as refunds. (4) The provisions of this subsection shall be held to be in addition to and not in substitution for or limitation of any other provision of this title. (f) Preservation of rights.-- Nothing in this section shall restrict the right of any party to pursue any other remedy available to it under this part.

(a) General rule.-- Any two or more condominiums by agreement of the unit owners as provided in subsection (b) may be merged or consolidated into a single condominium. In the event of a merger or consolidation, unless the agreement otherwise provides, the resultant condominium is, for all purposes, the legal successor of all of the preexisting condominiums, and the operations and activities of all associations of the preexisting condominiums shall be merged or consolidated into a single association which shall hold all powers, rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of all preexisting associations. The resultant condominium shall, in addition, be subject in all respects to the provisions and requirements of this subpart regardless of whether or not any of the preexisting condominiums shall have been established under this subpart. (b) Requirements of agreement.-- The merger or consolidation of two or more condominiums pursuant to subsection (a) must be evidenced by a recorded agreement duly executed by the president of the association of each of the preexisting condominiums following approval by owners of units to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each condominium required to terminate such condominium. Any such agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is located and is not effective until so recorded. (c) Reallocations.-- Every merger or consolidation agreement must provide for the reallocation of the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association among the units of the resulting condominium either: (1) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based; or (2) by stating the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association which are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting condominiums, and providing that the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the association for the resulting condominium shall be the same as was allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting condominium by the declaration of the preexisting condominium. (d) Action by declarant.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), if a declarant expressly retained the special declarant right to merge or consolidate a condominium pursuant to section 3205(13) (relating to contents of declaration; all condominiums) and if the declarant exercised such right within the time period allowed for such exercise by giving written notice to that effect to all unit owners accompanied by a copy of the agreement evidencing such merger or consolidation, then such agreement may be executed by the declarant rather than by the president of the association of that condominium and without the necessity for approval or consent by unit owners or their mortgagees, provided that the agreement is recorded within the time period allowed for the exercise of this special declarant right.

      "text": "§ 3224. Coal operator responsibilities. (a) General rule.-- At any time prior to removing coal or other underground materials from, or extending the workings in, a coal mine within 500 feet of an oil or gas well of which the coal operator has knowledge, or within 500 feet of an approved well location of which the coal operator has knowledge, the coal operator, by certified mail, shall forward to or file with the well operator and the department a copy of the relevant part of all maps and plans which it is presently required by law to prepare and file with the department, showing the pillar which the coal operator proposes to leave in place around each oil or gas well in the projected workings. Thereafter, the coal operator may proceed with mining operations in the manner projected on the maps and plans, but the operator may not remove coal or cut a passageway within 150 feet of the well or approved well location without written approval under this section. If, in the opinion of the well operator or the department, the plan indicates that the proposed pillar is inadequate to protect either the integrity of the well or public health and safety, the affected well operator shall attempt to reach an agreement with the coal operator on a suitable pillar, subject to approval of the department. Upon failure to agree, the well operator may, within ten days after receipt of the proposed plan under this section, file objections under section 3251 (relating to conferences), indicating the size of the pillar to be left as to each well. If objections are not timely filed and the department has none, the department shall grant approval, reciting that maps and plans have been filed, no objections have been made thereto and the pillar proposed to be left for each well is approved in the manner as projected. (b) Objections.-- If an objection is filed by the well operator or raised by the department, the department shall order that a conference be held under section 3251 within ten days of the filing of objections. At the conference, the coal operator and the person who has objected shall attempt to agree on a proposed plan, showing the pillar to be left around each well, which will satisfy the objections and receive department approval. If an agreement is reached, the department shall grant approval to the coal operator, reciting that a plan has been filed and the pillar to be left for each well is approved pursuant to the agreement. If an agreement is not reached on a plan showing the pillar to be left with respect to a well, the department, by appropriate order, shall determine the pillar to be left with respect to the well. In a proceeding under this section, the department shall follow as nearly as is possible the original plan filed by the coal operator. The department shall not require the coal operator to leave a pillar in excess of 100 feet in radius, except that the department may require a pillar of up to 150 feet in radius if the existence of unusual conditions is established. Pillars determined by the department shall be shown on maps or plans on file with the department as provided in subsection (a), and the department shall approve the pillar to be left for each well. (c) Pillars of reduced size.-- Application may be made at any time to the department by the coal operator to leave a pillar of a size smaller than shown on the plan approved or determined by the department under this section. If an application is filed, the department shall: (1) follow the appropriate procedure under subsection (a) or (b); (2) by appropriate order, determine a plan involving a pillar of a smaller size as to any well covered by the application; and (3) have the discretion to grant approval for the pillar to be left with respect to each well. (d) Violation.-- No coal operator, without written approval of the department after notice and opportunity for a hearing under this section, shall remove coal or cut a passageway so as to leave a pillar of smaller size, with respect to an oil or gas well, than that approved by the department under this chapter. (e) Limitation.-- With regard to a coal pillar required by law to be left around a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to: (1) require a well operator to pay for the coal pillar; (2) affect a right which a coal operator may have had prior to April 18, 1985, to obtain payment for the coal pillar; or (3) affect a duty or right which a storage operator or landowner may have had prior to April 18, 1985, to pay or not pay for the coal pillar. (f) Mining through plugged wells.-- A coal operator who intends to mine through a plugged oil or gas well or otherwise completely remove any pillar from around that well shall file a plan under subsection (a) which shall be subject to all of the provisions of this section. No coal operator may mine through a plugged oil or gas well of which he has knowledge until written approval has been granted by the department in accordance with this section. The Bureau of Deep Mine Safety in the department shall have the authority to establish conditions under which the department may approve a coal operator's plan to mine through a plugged oil or gas well.",

The amount for each county to which funds will be distributed shall be determined using a formula that divides the number of spud unconventional gas wells in the county by the number of spud unconventional gas wells in this Commonwealth and multiplies the resulting percentage by the amount available for distribution under this paragraph. (2) Except as provided in section 2302(a.4), 37% shall be distributed to municipalities in which spud unconventional gas wells are located. The amount for each municipality to which funds will be distributed shall be determined using a formula that divides the number of spud unconventional gas wells in the municipality by the number of spud unconventional gas wells in this Commonwealth and multiplies the resulting percentage by the amount available for distribution under this paragraph. (3) Except as provided in section 2302(a.4), 27% shall be distributed to municipalities located in a county in which spud unconventional gas wells are located. The amount available for distribution in each county shall be determined by dividing the number of spud unconventional gas wells in the county by the number of spud unconventional gas wells in this Commonwealth and multiplying the resulting percentage by the amount available for distribution under this paragraph. The resulting amount available for distribution in each county in which spud unconventional gas wells are located shall be distributed to each municipality in the county to which funds will be distributed as follows: (i) Except as provided in section 2302(a.4), 50% of the amount available under this paragraph shall be distributed to municipalities in which spud unconventional gas wells are located and to municipalities that are either contiguous with a municipality in which spud unconventional gas wells are located or are located within five linear miles of a spud unconventional gas well. The distribution shall be made as follows: (A) One-half shall be distributed to each municipality using a formula that divides the population of the eligible municipality within the county by the total population of all eligible municipalities within the county and multiplies the resulting percentage by the amount allocated to the county under this subparagraph. (B) One-half shall be distributed to each municipality using a formula that divides the highway mileage of the eligible municipality within the county by the total highway mileage of all eligible municipalities within the county and multiplies the resulting percentage by the amount allocated to the county under this subparagraph. (ii) Except as provided in section 2302(a.4), 50% of the amount available under this paragraph shall be distributed to each municipality in the county regardless of whether an unconventional gas well is located in the municipality as follows: (A) One-half shall be distributed to each municipality using a formula that divides the population of the municipality within the county by the total population of the county and multiplies the resulting percentage by the amount allocated to the county under this subparagraph. (B) One-half shall be distributed to each municipality using a formula that divides the highway mileage of the municipality within the county by the total highway mileage of the county and multiplies the resulting percentage by the amount allocated to the county under this subparagraph. (e) Restriction.-- The amount allocated to each municipality under subsection (d) shall not exceed the greater of $500,000 or 50% of the total budget for the prior fiscal year beginning with the 2010 budget year and continuing every year thereafter, adjusted to reflect any upward changes in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers for the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland area in the preceding 12 months.

      "heading": "Definitions",
      "text": "§ 2802. Declaration of policy. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) Over the past 20 years, the Federal Government and State government have introduced competition in several industries that previously had been regulated as natural monopolies. (2) Many state governments are implementing or studying policies that would create a competitive market for the generation of electricity. (3) Because of advances in electric generation technology and Federal initiatives to encourage greater competition in the wholesale electric market, it is now in the public interest to permit retail customers to obtain direct access to a competitive generation market as long as safe and affordable transmission and distribution service is available at levels of reliability that are currently enjoyed by the citizens and businesses of this Commonwealth. (4) Rates for electricity in this Commonwealth are on average higher than the national average, and significant differences exist among the rates of Pennsylvania electric utilities. (5) Competitive market forces are more effective than economic regulation in controlling the cost of generating electricity. (6) The cost of electricity is an important factor in decisions made by businesses concerning locating, expanding and retaining facilities in this Commonwealth. (7) This Commonwealth must begin the transition from regulation to greater competition in the electricity generation market to benefit all classes of customers and to protect this Commonwealth's ability to compete in the national and international marketplace for industry and jobs. (8) In moving toward greater competition in the electricity generation market, the Commonwealth must resolve certain transitional issues in a manner that is fair to customers, electric utilities, investors, the employees of electric utilities, local communities, nonutility generators of electricity and other affected parties. (9) Electric service is essential to the health and well-being of residents, to public safety and to orderly economic development, and electric service should be available to all customers on reasonable terms and conditions. (10) The Commonwealth must, at a minimum, continue the protections, policies and services that now assist customers who are low-income to afford electric service. (11) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the electric system, ensure the continued provision of high-quality customer service and avoid economic dislocation, utilities shall consider the experience and expertise of their work force in moving towards competition. (12) The purpose of this chapter is to modify existing legislation and regulations and to establish standards and procedures in order to create direct access by retail customers to the competitive market for the generation of electricity while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system for all parties. Reliable electric service is of the utmost importance to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. Electric industry restructuring should ensure the reliability of the interconnected electric system by maintaining the efficiency of the transmission and distribution system. (13) Under current law and regulation there exists some competition in the wholesale market for the generation of electricity, but the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sale of electricity is provided generally by public utilities under bundled rates regulated by the commission. The procedures established under this chapter provide for a fair and orderly transition from the current regulated structure to a structure under which retail customers will have direct access to a competitive market for the generation and sale or purchase of electricity. (14) This chapter requires electric utilities to unbundle their rates and services and to provide open access over their transmission and distribution systems to allow competitive suppliers to generate and sell electricity directly to consumers in this Commonwealth. The generation of electricity will no longer be regulated as a public utility function except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. Electric generation suppliers will be required to obtain licenses, demonstrate financial responsibility and comply with such other requirements concerning service as the commission deems necessary for the protection of the public. (15) In establishing the standards for the transition to and creation of a competitive electric market, heretofore, public utilities generally have had an obligation to serve customers within their defined service territories; consistent with that obligation, have undertaken long-term investments in generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to meet the needs of their customers; and have entered into long-term power supply agreements as required by Federal law. In many instances, these investments and agreements have created costs which may not be recoverable in a competitive market. The commission is empowered under this chapter to determine the level of transition or stranded costs for each electric utility and to provide a mechanism, the competitive transition charge, for recovery of an appropriate amount of such costs in accordance with the standards established in this chapter. (16) It is in the public interest for the transmission and distribution of electricity to continue to be regulated as a natural monopoly subject to the jurisdiction and active supervision of the commission. Electric distribution companies should continue to be the provider of last resort in order to ensure the availability of universal electric service in this Commonwealth unless another provider of last resort is approved by the commission. (17) There are certain public purpose costs, including programs for low-income assistance, energy conservation and others, which have been implemented and supported by public utilities' bundled rates. The public purpose is to be promoted by continuing universal service and energy conservation policies, protections and services, and full recovery of such costs is to be permitted through a nonbypassable rate mechanism. (18) There are certain changes to a utility which will create transition costs to accomplish the move to a competitive market. These changes may entail the closure of facilities or reduction in employee levels. If such actions are to be undertaken, the utility must fully inform the commission of the impact of such decisions on local communities and on social services and of any tax implications of the actions. The utility is expected to discuss the transition to competition with its employees or their certified representatives and may provide severance, retraining, early retirement and outplacement services. Such transition costs may be recoverable under the competitive transition charge in section 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge). (19) All participants in the restructured electric industry are encouraged to coordinate their plans and transactions through an independent system operator or its functional equivalent. (20) Since continuing and ensuring the reliability of electric service depends on adequate generation and on conscientious inspection and maintenance of transmission and distribution systems, the independent system operator or its functional equivalent should set, and the commission shall set through regulations, inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement standards and enforce those standards. (21) Under Federal and State clean air laws and regulations, electricity generators located in states to the west and south of this Commonwealth are not subject to requirements as stringent as those which apply to generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the act of January 8, 1960 (1959 P.L.2119, No.787), known as the Air Pollution Control Act, operating in this Commonwealth and that different regions within this Commonwealth are subject to varying air emission requirements. Under some scenarios, competition among electricity generators located in different states and different regions within this Commonwealth could make it more difficult for areas in this Commonwealth to demonstrate attainment with Federal and State air quality standards. Since this result may be caused by the disparate requirements imposed by Federal and State law on generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act in this Commonwealth and generators located in other states, the General Assembly supports changes to Federal clean air laws and regulations that will protect Pennsylvania's environment and ensure that electricity generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act located in this Commonwealth are not placed at an undue competitive disadvantage. The commission will consult with the Department of Environmental Protection regarding this issue during the transition to retail competition. Cross References.

(a) Monitoring competitive conditions.-- The commission shall monitor the market for the supply and distribution of electricity to retail customers and take steps as set forth in this section to prevent anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct and the unlawful exercise of market power. (b) Initiation of investigations.-- Upon complaint or upon its own motion for good cause shown, the commission shall conduct an investigation of the impact on the proper functioning of a fully competitive retail electricity market, including the effect of mergers, consolidations, acquisition or disposition of assets or securities of electricity suppliers, transmission congestion and anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct affecting the retail distribution of electricity. (c) Conduct of investigations.-- (1) The commission may require an electricity supplier to provide information, including documents and testimony, in accordance with the commission's regulations regarding the discovery of information from any electricity supplier. (2) Confidential, proprietary or trade secret information provided under this subsection shall not be disclosed to any person not directly employed or retained by the commission to conduct the investigation without the consent of the party providing the information. (3) Notwithstanding the prohibition on disclosure of information in paragraph (2), the commission shall disclose information obtained under this subsection to the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate under an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The commission may disclose the information to appropriate Federal or State law enforcement officials if it determines that the disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent or restrain a violation of Federal or State law and it provides the party that provided the information with reasonable notice and opportunity to prevent or limit disclosure. (d) Referrals and intervention.-- If, as a result of an investigation conducted under this section, the commission has reason to believe that anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, is preventing the retail electricity customers in this Commonwealth from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market, the commission, pursuant to its regulations, shall: (1) Refer its findings to the Attorney General, the United States Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. (2) Subject to subsection (c)(3), disclose any information it has obtained in the course of its investigation to the agency or agencies to which it has made a referral under paragraph (1). (3) Intervene, as provided and permitted by law or regulation, in any proceedings initiated as a result of a referral made under paragraph (1). (e) Approval of proposed mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or dispositions.-- (1) In the exercise of authority the commission otherwise may have to approve the mergers or consolidations by electric utilities or electricity suppliers, or the acquisition or disposition of assets or securities of other public utilities or electricity suppliers, the commission shall consider whether the proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition is likely to result in anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, which will prevent retail electricity customers in this Commonwealth from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market. (2) Upon request for approval, the commission shall provide notice and an opportunity for open, public evidentiary hearings. If the commission finds, after hearing, that a proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition is likely to result in anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, which will prevent retail electricity customers in this Commonwealth from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market, the commission shall not approve such proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition, except upon such terms and conditions as it finds necessary to preserve the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market. (e.1) Market misconduct.-- (1) If an electric distribution company or any of its affiliated companies or any company that an electric distribution company has purchased generation from is found guilty of market manipulation, exercising market power or collusion by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or any Federal or State court or, if an electric distribution company or any one of its affiliated companies or any company that an electric distribution company has purchased generation from settles a claim of market manipulation, exercising market power or collusion that is brought by a regional transmission operator's market monitoring unit, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or another entity, the commission: (i) Shall direct the electric distribution company to take any and all reasonable action to quantify the effect of the market misconduct upon Pennsylvania ratepayers. (ii) Following public hearing on the matter and a finding of public interest, may direct the electric distribution company to take any and all reasonable legal action, including the filing of a lawsuit as may be necessary, to recover the quantified damages which shall be used to recompense Pennsylvania ratepayers affected by the market misconduct. (2) If the electric distribution company fails to pursue reasonable action to quantify or seek recovery of damages for Pennsylvania ratepayers affected by market manipulation, the exercise of market power or collusion, the commission is authorized, following notice and an opportunity of the electric distribution company to comply or contest, to assess a civil penalty, which shall not be recovered in rates, of not more than $10,000 per day for failure or neglect to obey an order of the commission, the continuance of the failure or neglect being a separate offense. (3) Any monetary damages recovered by the electric distribution company shall be paid to affected Pennsylvania ratepayers in the form of a credit to their electric bills or as refunds. (4) The provisions of this subsection shall be held to be in addition to and not in substitution for or limitation of any other provision of this title. (f) Preservation of rights.-- Nothing in this section shall restrict the right of any party to pursue any other remedy available to it under this part.

      "text": "§ 3218. Protection of water supplies. (a) General rule.-- In addition to the requirements of subsection (c.1), a well operator who affects a public or private water supply by pollution or diminution shall restore or replace the affected supply with an alternate source of water adequate in quantity or quality for the purposes served by the supply. The department shall ensure that the quality of a restored or replaced water supply meets the standards established under the act of May 1, 1984 (P.L.206, No.43), known as the Pennsylvania Safe Drinking Water Act, or is comparable to the quality of the water supply before it was affected by the operator if that water supply exceeded those standards. The Environmental Quality Board shall promulgate regulations necessary to meet the requirements of this subsection. (b) Pollution or diminution of water supply.-- A landowner or water purveyor suffering pollution or diminution of a water supply as a result of the drilling, alteration or operation of an oil or gas well may so notify the department and request that an investigation be conducted. Within ten days of notification, the department shall investigate the claim and make a determination within 45 days following notification. If the department finds that the pollution or diminution was caused by drilling, alteration or operation activities or if it presumes the well operator responsible for pollution under subsection (c), the department shall issue orders to the well operator necessary to assure compliance with subsection (a), including orders requiring temporary replacement of a water supply where it is determined that pollution or diminution may be of limited duration. (b.1) (Reserved). (b.2) Telephone number.-- The department shall establish a single Statewide toll-free telephone number that persons may use to report cases of water contamination which may be associated with the development of oil and gas resources. The Statewide toll-free telephone number shall be provided in a conspicuous manner in the notification required under section 3211(b) (relating to well permits) and on the department's Internet website. (b.3) Responses.-- The department shall develop appropriate administrative responses to calls received on the Statewide toll-free telephone number for water contamination. (b.4) Website.-- The department shall publish, on its Internet website, lists of confirmed cases of subterranean water supply contamination that result from hydraulic fracturing. (b.5) Facility operation qualifications.-- The department shall ensure that a facility which seeks a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the purposes of treating and discharging wastewater originating from oil and gas activities into waters of this Commonwealth is operated by a competent and qualified individual. (c) Presumption.-- Unless rebutted by a defense established in subsection (d), it shall be presumed that a well operator is responsible for pollution of a water supply if: (1) except as set forth in paragraph (2): (i) the water supply is within 1,000 feet of an oil or gas well; and (ii) the pollution occurred within six months after completion of drilling or alteration of the oil or gas well; or (2) in the case of an unconventional well: (i) the water supply is within 2,500 feet of the unconventional vertical well bore; and (ii) the pollution occurred within 12 months of the later of completion, drilling, stimulation or alteration of the unconventional well. (c.1) Requirement.-- If the affected water supply is within the rebuttable presumption area as provided in subsection (c) and the rebuttable presumption applies, the operator shall provide a temporary water supply if the water user is without a readily available alternative source of water. The temporary water supply provided under this subsection shall be adequate in quantity and quality for the purposes served by the supply. (d) Defenses.-- To rebut the presumption established under subsection (c), a well operator must affirmatively prove any of the following: (1) except as set forth in paragraph (2): (i) the pollution existed prior to the drilling or alteration activity as determined by a predrilling or prealteration survey; (ii) the landowner or water purveyor refused to allow the operator access to conduct a predrilling or prealteration survey; (iii) the water supply is not within 1,000 feet of the well; (iv) the pollution occurred more than six months after completion of drilling or alteration activities; and (v) the pollution occurred as the result of a cause other than the drilling or alteration activity; or (2) in the case of an unconventional well: (i) the pollution existed prior to the drilling, stimulation or alteration activity as determined by a predrilling or prealteration survey; (ii) the landowner or water purveyor refused to allow the operator access to conduct a predrilling or prealteration survey; (iii) the water supply is not within 2,500 feet of the unconventional vertical well bore; (iv) the pollution occurred more than 12 months after completion of drilling or alteration activities; or (v) the pollution occurred as the result of a cause other than the drilling or alteration activity. (e) Independent certified laboratory.-- An operator electing to preserve a defense under subsection (d)(1) or (2) shall retain an independent certified laboratory to conduct a predrilling or prealteration survey of the water supply. A copy of survey results shall be submitted to the department and the landowner or water purveyor in the manner prescribed by the department. (e.1) Notice.-- An operator of an unconventional well must provide written notice to the landowner or water purveyor indicating that the presumption established under subsection (c) may be void if the landowner or water purveyor refused to allow the operator access to conduct a predrilling or prealteration survey. Proof of written notice to the landowner or water purveyor shall be provided to the department for the operator to retain the protections under subsection (d)(2)(ii). Proof of written notice shall be presumed if provided in accordance with section 3212(a) (relating to permit objections). (f) Other remedies preserved.-- Nothing in this section shall prevent a landowner or water purveyor claiming pollution or diminution of a water supply from seeking any other remedy at law or in equity.

(a) Number of votes required.-- Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain (section 3107), a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (b) Execution and recording agreement and ratifications.-- An agreement of unit owners to terminate a condominium must be evidenced by their execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners who are owners of record as of the date preceding the date of recordation of the termination agreement. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. The termination agreement will become null and void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of: (1) The expiration of one year from the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. (2) Such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. If, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the terms of the sale. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the condominium in both the grantor index and the grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recordation. (c) Status if real estate sold.-- The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). If the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (f). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this subpart or the declaration. (d) Status if real estate not sold.-- If the real estate constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to the real estate, upon termination, vests in the unit owners as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (f) and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. (e) Distribution of assets of association.-- Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, shall be held by the association as trustee or unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units which were recorded, filed of public record or otherwise perfected before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination. (f) Respective interests of unit owners.-- The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (c), (d) and (e) are as follows: (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements and common element interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements. (2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof prior to destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination. (g) Effect of foreclosure or enforcement of lien.-- Except as provided in subsection (h), foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the condominium. (h) Exclusion from condominium upon foreclosure.-- If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over the declaration and if the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium. (i) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.-- In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the condominium other than a provision providing for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the condominium would otherwise be terminated owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the condominium are allocated vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.

(a) Secured lender approval.-- The declaration may require that all or a specified number or percentage of the mortgagees or beneficiaries of deeds of trust encumbering the units approve specified actions of the unit owners or the association as a condition to the effectiveness of those actions but no requirement for approval may operate to: (1) deny or delegate control over the general administrative affairs of the association by the unit owners or the executive board; or (2) prevent the association or the executive board from commencing, intervening in or settling any litigation or proceeding or receiving and distributing any insurance proceeds pursuant to section 3312 (relating to insurance). (b) Secured lender approval procedures.-- If the declaration requires mortgagees or beneficiaries of deeds of trust encumbering the units to approve specified actions of the unit owners or the association as a condition to the effectiveness of those actions, then the executive board will provide the lender with written notice of the specified action proposed to be taken, together with a request for the secured lender to approve or disapprove the actions specified. If the notice to the secured lender, issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subsection, states that the secured lender will be deemed to have approved the actions specified in the written notice if it does not respond to the request within 45 days and the secured lender does not respond in writing within 45 days, then the secured lender will be deemed for all purposes to have approved the actions specified in the notice.

(a) Applicability of section.-- If the declaration for a condominium provides that any of the powers described in section 3302 (relating to powers of unit owners' association) with respect to the condominium are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association (a \"master association\") which exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more other condominiums or other incorporated or unincorporated associations, then, except as modified by this section, all provisions of this subpart applicable to unit owners' associations shall apply to any such master association insofar as its actions affect the condominium. (b) Powers.-- Unless a master association is acting in the capacity of an association described in section 3301 (relating to organization of unit owners' association) with respect to a condominium which is part of the master association, it may exercise with respect to the condominium only such powers set forth in section 3302 and only to the extent expressly permitted in the declaration of condominium which provides for the delegation of powers from its condominium association to the master association and accepted by such master association as indicated in the provisions of the declaration or other organizational documents of such master association. (c) Liability of executive board members and officers.-- If the declaration of a condominium provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board have no liability for the acts or omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following such delegation. The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the condominium association whose powers are delegated thereto and the unit owners of such condominium on the same basis as officers and executive board members of such condominium immediately before such delegation of powers. (d) Rights and responsibilities of persons electing governing body.-- The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in sections 3303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 3308 (relating to meetings), 3309 (relating to quorums), 3310 (relating to voting; proxies) and 3320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association with respect to the exercise of powers delegated pursuant to a condominium declaration to such master association, but apply only to those persons who elect the governing body of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this subpart. (e) Election of master association governing body.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3303(e) with respect to the election of the executive board by all unit owners after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 3301, the instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each condominium or the organizational documents of other associations the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association shall provide that the governing body of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways: (1) All unit owners of all condominiums and other properties subject to the master association elect all members of the governing body of the master association. (2) All members of the governing bodies of the condominium associations and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect all members of the master association governing body. (3) All unit owners of each condominium and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (4) All members of the governing bodies of the condominiums and other property associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (f) Delegation of responsibility and authority.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to a condominium if and when: (1) there occurs either a date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the condominium; (2) there occurs an event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable, and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that: (i) such event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the condominium; and (ii) that a copy of such instrument has been sent to all unit owners; or (3) the declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the condominium and that a copy of such instrument has been sent to the executive board and all unit owners. Paragraph (3) shall be applicable only if the declarant shall have expressly reserved in the declaration, pursuant to section 3205(12) (relating to contents of declaration; all condominiums), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the condominium and only if the instrument exercising such right shall have been recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right. (g) Delegation of all powers.-- If all the powers of a condominium association are delegated to a master association and accepted by such master association pursuant to subsection (b), then the governing body of the master association may act in all respects as the executive board of the condominium and no separate executive board need be elected or exist.

(a) General rule.-- Any two or more condominiums by agreement of the unit owners as provided in subsection (b) may be merged or consolidated into a single condominium. In the event of a merger or consolidation, unless the agreement otherwise provides, the resultant condominium is, for all purposes, the legal successor of all of the preexisting condominiums, and the operations and activities of all associations of the preexisting condominiums shall be merged or consolidated into a single association which shall hold all powers, rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of all preexisting associations. The resultant condominium shall, in addition, be subject in all respects to the provisions and requirements of this subpart regardless of whether or not any of the preexisting condominiums shall have been established under this subpart. (b) Requirements of agreement.-- The merger or consolidation of two or more condominiums pursuant to subsection (a) must be evidenced by a recorded agreement duly executed by the president of the association of each of the preexisting condominiums following approval by owners of units to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each condominium required to terminate such condominium. Any such agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is located and is not effective until so recorded. (c) Reallocations.-- Every merger or consolidation agreement must provide for the reallocation of the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association among the units of the resulting condominium either: (1) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based; or (2) by stating the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association which are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting condominiums, and providing that the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the association for the resulting condominium shall be the same as was allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting condominium by the declaration of the preexisting condominium.

      "text": "§ 3224. Coal operator responsibilities. (a) General rule.-- At any time prior to removing coal or other underground materials from, or extending the workings in, a coal mine within 500 feet of an oil or gas well of which the coal operator has knowledge, or within 500 feet of an approved well location of which the coal operator has knowledge, the coal operator, by certified mail, shall forward to or file with the well operator and the department a copy of the relevant part of all maps and plans which it is presently required by law to prepare and file with the department, showing the pillar which the coal operator proposes to leave in place around each oil or gas well in the projected workings. Thereafter, the coal operator may proceed with mining operations in the manner projected on the maps and plans, but the operator may not remove coal or cut a passageway within 150 feet of the well or approved well location without written approval under this section. If, in the opinion of the well operator or the department, the plan indicates that the proposed pillar is inadequate to protect either the integrity of the well or public health and safety, the affected well operator shall attempt to reach an agreement with the coal operator on a suitable pillar, subject to approval of the department. Upon failure to agree, the well operator may, within ten days after receipt of the proposed plan under this section, file objections under section 3251 (relating to conferences), indicating the size of the pillar to be left as to each well. If objections are not timely filed and the department has none, the department shall grant approval, reciting that maps and plans have been filed, no objections have been made thereto and the pillar proposed to be left for each well is approved in the manner as projected. (b) Objections.-- If an objection is filed by the well operator or raised by the department, the department shall order that a conference be held under section 3251 within ten days of the filing of objections. At the conference, the coal operator and the person who has objected shall attempt to agree on a proposed plan, showing the pillar to be left around each well, which will satisfy the objections and receive department approval. If an agreement is reached, the department shall grant approval to the coal operator, reciting that a plan has been filed and the pillar to be left for each well is approved pursuant to the agreement. If an agreement is not reached on a plan showing the pillar to be left with respect to a well, the department, by appropriate order, shall determine the pillar to be left with respect to the well. In a proceeding under this section, the department shall follow as nearly as is possible the original plan filed by the coal operator. The department shall not require the coal operator to leave a pillar in excess of 100 feet in radius, except that the department may require a pillar of up to 150 feet in radius if the existence of unusual conditions is established. Pillars determined by the department shall be shown on maps or plans on file with the department as provided in subsection (a), and the department shall approve the pillar to be left for each well. (c) Pillars of reduced size.-- Application may be made at any time to the department by the coal operator to leave a pillar of a size smaller than shown on the plan approved or determined by the department under this section. If an application is filed, the department shall: (1) follow the appropriate procedure under subsection (a) or (b); (2) by appropriate order, determine a plan involving a pillar of a smaller size as to any well covered by the application; and (3) have the discretion to grant approval for the pillar to be left with respect to each well. (d) Violation.-- No coal operator, without written approval of the department after notice and opportunity for a hearing under this section, shall remove coal or cut a passageway so as to leave a pillar of smaller size, with respect to an oil or gas well, than that approved by the department under this chapter. (e) Limitation.-- With regard to a coal pillar required by law to be left around a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to: (1) require a well operator to pay for the coal pillar; (2) affect a right which a coal operator may have had prior to April 18, 1985, to obtain payment for the coal pillar; or (3) affect a duty or right which a storage operator or landowner may have had prior to April 18, 1985, to pay or not pay for the coal pillar. (f) Mining through plugged wells.-- A coal operator who intends to mine through a plugged oil or gas well or otherwise completely remove any pillar from around that well shall file a plan under subsection (a) which shall be subject to all of the provisions of this section. No coal operator may mine through a plugged oil or gas well of which he has knowledge until written approval has been granted by the department in accordance with this section. The Bureau of Deep Mine Safety in the department shall have the authority to establish conditions under which the department may approve a coal operator's plan to mine through a plugged oil or gas well.",

(a) General rule.-- The following shall apply: (1) Except as provided in subsection (d), upon filing an application for a well permit and before continuing to operate an oil or gas well, the owner or operator of the well shall file with the department a bond covering the well and well site on a form to be prescribed and furnished by the department. A bond filed with an application for a well permit shall be payable to the Commonwealth and conditioned upon the operator's faithful performance of all drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. A bond for a well in existence on April 18, 1985, shall be payable to the Commonwealth and conditioned upon the operator's faithful performance of all water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The amount of the bond required shall be in the following amounts and amounts under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) may be adjusted by the Environmental Quality Board every two years to reflect the projected costs to the Commonwealth of plugging the well: (i) For unconventional wells with a total well bore length less than 6,000 feet: (A) For operating up to 50 wells, $4,000 per well, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $35,000.

(C) For operating 51 to 150 wells, $290,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 50 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $430,000. (D) For operating more than 150 wells, $430,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 150 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $600,000. (iii) For a well other than an unconventional well, $2,500 per well. For 10 years following the effective date of this subparagraph, the Environmental Quality Board and the department shall have no authority to adjust the amount under this subparagraph. (2) The following apply: (i) Except as provided under subparagraph (ii), in lieu of individual bonds for each well, an owner or operator may file a blanket bond for the applicable amount under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii), on a form prepared by the department, covering all of its wells in this Commonwealth, as enumerated on the bond form. (ii) As follows: (A) An operator may file a blanket bond of $25,000 for all of the operator's wells in this Commonwealth that are not unconventional wells. (B) For every new well that is not an unconventional well drilled after six months after the effective date of this subsection, the bond amount for that operator shall increase by $1,000. (C) The total blanket bond for an operator's wells that are not unconventional wells shall not exceed $100,000. (D) The blanket bond increase of $1,000 shall be waived by the department for a new well drilled under this subsection if the operator provides evidence to the department that the operator has plugged an orphan well at the operator's own expense for which the operator was not the responsible party within the previous 365 days that the operator has not yet received credit for under this subsection by the department. (E) For 10 years following the effective date of this clause, the bond amounts for wells that are not unconventional wells may only be revised by the General Assembly. The Environmental Quality Board and the department shall have no authority to adjust bond amounts related to wells that are not unconventional wells during that time period. (2.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, section 1934-A of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929, shall continue to apply to a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985. (3) Liability under the bond shall continue until the well has been properly plugged in accordance with this chapter and for a period of one year after filing of the certificate of plugging with the department. Each bond shall be executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do business in this Commonwealth and approved by the secretary. In lieu of a corporate surety, the operator may deposit with the department: (i) cash; (ii) certificates of deposit or automatically renewable irrevocable letters of credit, from financial institutions chartered or authorized to do business in this Commonwealth and regulated and examined by the Commonwealth or a Federal agency, which may be terminated at the end of a term only upon 90 days' prior written notice by the financial institution to the permittee and the department; (iii) negotiable bonds of the United States Government or the Commonwealth, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, the General State Authority, the State Public School Building Authority or any municipality within the Commonwealth; or (iv) United States Treasury Bonds issued at a discount without a regular schedule of interest payments to maturity, otherwise known as Zero Coupon Bonds, having a maturity date of not more than ten years after the date of purchase and at the maturity date having a value of not less than the applicable amount under paragraph (1). The cash deposit, certificate of deposit, amount of the irrevocable letter of credit or market value of the securities shall be equal at least to the sum of the bond. (4) The secretary shall, upon receipt of a deposit of cash, letters of credit or negotiable bonds, immediately place the same with the State Treasurer, whose duty it shall be to receive and hold the same in the name of the Commonwealth, in trust, for the purpose for which the deposit is made. (5) The State Treasurer shall at all times be responsible for custody and safekeeping of deposits. The operator making the deposit shall be entitled from time to time to demand and receive from the State Treasurer, on the written order of the secretary, the whole or any portion of collateral deposited, upon depositing with the State Treasurer, in lieu of that collateral, other collateral of classes specified in this section having a market value at least equal to the sum of the bond, and also to demand, receive and recover the interest and income from the negotiable bonds as they become due and payable. (6) If negotiable bonds on deposit under this subsection mature or are called, the State Treasurer, at the request of the owner of the bonds, shall convert them into other negotiable bonds, of classes specified in this section, designated by the owner. (7) If notice of intent to terminate a letter of credit is given, the department shall give the operator 30 days' written notice to replace the letter of credit with other acceptable bond guarantees as provided in this section. If the owner or operator fails to timely replace the letter of credit, the department shall draw upon and convert the letter of credit into cash and hold it as a collateral bond guarantee. (b) Release.-- No bond shall be fully released until the requirements of subsection (a) and section 3223 (relating to notification and effect of well transfer) have been fully met. Upon release of bonds and collateral under this section, the State Treasurer shall immediately return to the owner the specified amount of cash or securities. (c) Noncompliance.-- If a well owner or operator fails or refuses to comply with subsection (a), regulations promulgated under this chapter or conditions of a permit relating to this chapter, the department may declare the bond forfeited and shall certify the same to the Attorney General, who shall proceed to enforce and collect the full amount of the bond and, if the well owner or operator has deposited cash or securities as collateral in lieu of a corporate surety, the department shall declare the collateral forfeited and direct the State Treasurer to pay the full amount of the funds into the Well Plugging Restricted Revenue Account or to sell the security to the extent forfeited and pay the proceeds into the Well Plugging Restricted Revenue Account. If a corporate surety or financial institution fails to pay a forfeited bond promptly and in full, the corporate surety or financial institution shall be disqualified from writing further bonds under this chapter or any other environmental law administered by the department. A person aggrieved by reason of forfeiting the bond or converting collateral, as provided in this section, shall have a right to appeal to the Environmental Hearing Board in the manner provided by law. Upon forfeiture of a blanket bond for a violation occurring at one or more well sites, the person whose bond is forfeited shall, within ten days of the forfeiture, submit a replacement bond to cover all other wells of which the person is an owner or operator. Failure to submit the replacement bond constitutes a violation of this section as to each of the wells owned or operated by the person. (d) Alternatives to certain bonds.-- The following shall apply: (1) An operator of not more than 200 wells who cannot obtain a bond for a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985, as required under subsection (a), due to inability to demonstrate sufficient financial resources may, in lieu of the bond: (i) Submit to the department a fee in the amount of $50 per well, a blanket fee of $500 for ten to 20 wells or a blanket fee of $1,000 for more than 20 wells, which shall be a nonrefundable fee paid each year that the operator has not filed a bond with the department. All fees collected in lieu of a bond under this subsection shall be used for the purposes authorized by this chapter. The Environmental Quality Board shall have the power, by regulation, to increase the amount of the fees established under this subsection. (ii) Make phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond, subject to the following: (A) Payment shall be based on the number of wells owned or operated. The operator shall make an initial deposit and make annual deposits in accordance with the schedule in clause (B). Interest accumulated by the collateral shall become a part of the bond until the collateral plus accumulated interest equals the amount of the required bond. The collateral shall be deposited, in trust, with the State Treasurer as provided in this subsection or with a bank selected by the department which shall act as trustee for the benefit of the Commonwealth to guarantee the operator's compliance with the drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The operator shall be required to pay all costs of the trust. (B) An operator of up to ten existing wells who does not intend to operate additional wells shall deposit $250 per well and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $50 per well until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 11 to 25 wells or an operator of up to ten wells who applies for one or more permits for additional wells shall deposit $2,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,150 plus $150 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 26 to 50 wells shall deposit $3,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,300 plus $400 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 51 to 100 wells shall deposit $4,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,500 plus $400 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. Operators of 101 to 200 wells shall deposit $8,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,600 plus $1,000 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. Operators of more than 200 wells shall fully bond their wells immediately. (C) The department shall reduce the amount of phased collateral payments or the period of time over which phased collateral payments shall be made on behalf of owners or operators who, prior to August 1, 1992, have paid a fee in lieu of bond under subparagraph (i), and who, by August 1, 1993, choose to enter the phased collateral program under this subparagraph rather than continue to make payments in lieu of bond. Payments made prior to August 1, 1992, in lieu of bond shall not be credited in any other manner, and the department shall not be required to refund the fees. The Environmental Quality Board, by regulation, may change the annual deposits established under clause (B) if necessary to accommodate a change in the amount of the bond required under this section. (2) An operator may continue to pay a fee in lieu of bond or make phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond so long as the operator does not miss a payment under this subsection and remains in compliance with this chapter. If an operator misses a payment under this subsection, the operator shall: (i) immediately submit the appropriate bond amount in full; or (ii) cease all operations and plug all wells. (d.1) Individuals.-- The following shall apply: (1) An individual who is unable to obtain a bond to drill new wells due to inability to demonstrate financial resources may meet the collateral bond requirements of subsection (a) by making phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond. The individual shall be limited to drilling ten new wells per calendar year and, for each well to be drilled, deposit $500 and make an annual deposit of 10% of the remaining bond amount for a period of ten years. Interest accumulated shall become a part of the bond until the collateral plus accumulated interest equals the amount of the required bond. The collateral shall be deposited in trust with the State Treasurer under subsection (a) or with a bank selected by the department which shall act as trustee for the benefit of the Commonwealth to guarantee the individual's compliance with the drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The individual shall pay all costs of the trust. (2) Individuals may continue to use phased collateral to obtain permits if they have not missed a payment for a well drilled under this provision and remain in compliance with this chapter. If an individual misses a payment, the individual shall: (i) immediately submit the appropriate bond amount in full; or (ii) cease all operations and plug all wells. (3) For purposes of this subsection, an \"individual\" means a natural person doing business under his own name. (e) Reservation of remedies.-- All remedies for violations of this chapter, regulations adopted under this chapter and conditions of permits are expressly preserved. Nothing in this section shall be construed as an exclusive penalty or remedy for violations of law. No action taken under this section shall waive or impair any other remedy or penalty provided in law. (f) Change of law.-- Owners or operators who have failed to meet the requirements of this section prior to August 1, 1992, shall not be required to make payments under this section on a retroactive basis as a condition of obtaining a permit under this chapter, nor shall the failure be deemed a violation of this chapter. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"well site\" means areas occupied by all equipment or facilities necessary for or incidental to drilling, production or plugging a well.

(a) General rule.-- A person who operates or proposes to operate a storage reservoir, except one filled by the secondary recovery or gas recycling process, shall: (1) Use every known method which is reasonable under the circumstances for discovering and locating all wells which have or may have been drilled into or through the storage reservoir. (2) Plug or recondition, as provided in departmental regulations, all known wells drilled into or through the storage reservoir, except to the extent otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c). (b) Wells to be plugged.-- To comply with subsection (a), wells which are to be plugged shall be plugged in the manner specified in section 3220 (relating to plugging requirements). (b.1) Wells plugged prior to enactment of section.-- If a well located in the storage reservoir area has been plugged prior to April 18, 1985, and on the basis of data, information and other evidence submitted to the department, it is determined that the plugging was done in the manner required by section 3220 or approved as an alternative method under section 3221 (relating to alternative methods) and the plugging is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter, the obligations under subsection (a) with regard to plugging the well shall be considered to have been fully satisfied. (c) Wells to be reconditioned.-- The following shall apply: (1) To comply with subsection (a), wells which are to be reconditioned shall, unless the department by regulation specifies a different procedure, be cleaned out from the surface through the storage horizon, and the producing casing and casing strings determined not to be in good physical condition shall be replaced with new casing, using the same procedure as is applicable to drilling a new well under this chapter. In the case of wells to be used for gas storage, the annular space between each string of casing and the annular space behind the largest diameter casing to the extent possible shall be filled to the surface with cement or bentonitic mud or a nonporous material approved by the department under section 3221. At least 15 days prior to reconditioning, the storage operator shall give notice to the department, setting forth in the notice the manner in which it is planned to recondition the well and any pertinent data known to the storage operator which will indicate the condition of the well existing at that time. In addition, the storage operator shall give the department at least 72 hours' notice of the time when reconditioning is to begin. If no objections are raised by the department within ten days, the storage operator may proceed with reconditioning in accordance with the plan as submitted. If objections are made by the department, the department may fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251 (relating to conferences) at which the storage operator and department shall endeavor to agree on a plan to satisfy the objections and meet the requirements of this section. If no agreement is reached, the department may, by an appropriate order, determine whether the plan, as submitted, meets the requirements of this section or what changes, if any, are required. If, in reconditioning a well in accordance with the plan, physical conditions are encountered which justify or necessitate a change in the plan, the storage operator may request that the plan be changed. If the request is denied, the department shall fix a conference under section 3251 and proceed in the same manner as with original objections. An application may be made in the manner prescribed by section 3221 for approval of an alternative method of reconditioning a well. If a well located within the storage reservoir was reconditioned, or drilled and equipped, prior to April 18, 1985, the obligations imposed by subsection (a), as to reconditioning the well, shall be considered fully satisfied if, on the basis of the data, information and other evidence submitted to the department, it is determined that: (i) The conditioning or previous drilling and equipping was done in the manner required in this subsection, in regulations promulgated under this chapter or in a manner approved as an alternative method in accordance with section 3221. (ii) The reconditioning or previous drilling and equipping is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter. (2) If a well requires emergency repairs, this chapter shall not be construed to require the storage operator to give any notice required by this subsection before making the repairs. (d) Exception.-- The requirements of subsection (a) shall not apply to injection of gas into a stratum when the sole purpose of injection, referred to in this subsection as testing, is to determine whether the stratum is suitable for storage purposes. Testing shall be conducted only in compliance with the following requirements: (1) The person testing or proposing to test shall comply with section 3231 (relating to reporting requirements for gas storage operations) and verify the statement required to be filed by that section. (2) The storage operator shall give at least six months' written notice to the department of the fact that injection of gas for testing purposes is proposed. (3) If the department has objections, the department shall fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251, not more than ten days from the date of notice to the storage operator, at which time the storage operator and department shall attempt to resolve the issues presented. If an agreement cannot be reached, the department may issue an appropriate order. (e) Failure to execute lawful order.-- In a proceeding under this chapter, if the department determines that an operator of a storage reservoir has failed to carry out a lawful order issued under this chapter, the department may require the operator to suspend operation of the reservoir and withdraw the gas until the violation is remedied, in which case the storage operator, limited by due diligence insofar as existing facilities utilized to remove gas from the reservoir will permit, shall: (1) if possible, remove the amount required by the department to be removed; or (2) in any event, remove the maximum amount which can be withdrawn in accordance with recognized engineering and operating procedures. (f) Duty of storage reservoir operator.-- The following shall apply: (1) A person owning or operating a storage reservoir subject to this chapter shall have a duty to: (i) Maintain all wells drilled into or through the reservoir in a condition and operate them in a manner sufficient to prevent the escape of gas. (ii) Operate and maintain the reservoir and its facilities as prescribed by departmental regulations and at a pressure which will prevent gas from escaping, but the pressure shall not exceed the highest rock pressure found to have existed during the production history of the reservoir or another high pressure limit approved by the department after holding a conference under section 3251 based on geological and production knowledge of the reservoir, its character, permeability distribution and operating experience. (2) The duty under paragraph (1) shall not be construed to include inability to prevent the escape of gas when gas escapes as a result of an act of God or a person not under the control of the storage operator. In that instance, the storage operator shall have a duty to take action reasonably necessary to prevent the further escape of gas. This paragraph does not apply to a well which the storage operator failed to locate and make known to the department.",

(b.1) Order of department.-- If the statement required under subsection (b) is not filed by the storage reservoir operator within the time specified by this chapter or the regulations of the department, the department may order the operator to file the statement. (c) Procedure.-- Within 120 days after receipt of a statement required by this section, the department may direct that a conference be held in accordance with section 3251 to determine whether the requirements of section 3231 and subsection (a) have been fully met. At the conference, if any person believes the requirements have not been fully met, the parties shall attempt to agree on additional actions to be taken and the time for completion, subject to approval of the department. If an agreement cannot be reached, the department shall make a determination and, if the department determines any requirements have not been met, the department shall issue an order specifying in detail the extent to which the requirements have not been met and the actions which the storage operator must complete to meet the requirements. The order shall grant as much time as is reasonably necessary to fully comply. If the storage operator encounters conditions not known to exist at the time of issuance of the order and which materially affect the validity of the order or the ability of the storage operator to comply with it, the storage operator may apply for a rehearing or modification of the order. (d) Notification.-- If, in complying with subsection (a), a storage operator, after filing the statement provided for in subsection (b), plugs or reconditions a well, the storage operator shall notify the department and the coal operator affected, in writing, setting forth facts indicating the manner in which the plugging or reconditioning was done. Upon receipt of the notification, the coal operator or department may request a conference under section 3251. (e) Plugging wells.-- In order to meet the requirements of subsection (a), wells which are to be plugged shall be plugged in the manner specified in regulations promulgated under section 3211 (relating to well permits). When a well located within the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area has been plugged prior to April 18, 1985, and, on the basis of the data information and other evidence submitted to the department, it is determined that the plugging was done in the manner required by section 3220, or in a manner approved as an alternative method in accordance with section 3221 (relating to alternative methods), and the plugging is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter, the requirements of subsection (a) as to plugging the well shall be considered to have been fully satisfied. (f) Reconditioned wells.-- The following shall apply: (1) In order to comply with subsection (a), unless the department by regulation specifies a different procedure, wells which are to be reconditioned shall be cleaned out from the surface through the storage horizon, and the following casing strings shall be pulled and replaced with new casing, using the procedure applicable to drilling a new well under this chapter: (i) the producing casing; (ii) the largest diameter casing passing through the lowest workable coal seam unless it extends at least 25 feet below the bottom of the coal seam and is determined to be in good physical condition, but the storage operator may, instead of replacing the largest diameter casing, replace the next largest casing string if the casing string extends at least 25 feet below the lowest workable coal seam; and (iii) casing strings determined not to be in good physical condition. (2) In the case of a well to be used for gas storage, the annular space between each string of casing and the annular space behind the largest diameter casing, to the extent possible, shall be filled to the surface with cement or bentonitic mud or an equally nonporous material approved by the department under section 3221. (3) At least 15 days before a well is to be reconditioned, the storage operator shall give notice to the department and the coal operator, lessee or owner, setting forth the manner in which reconditioning is planned and pertinent data known to the storage operator which will indicate the current condition of the well, along with at least 72 hours' notice of the date and time when reconditioning will begin. The coal operator, lessee or owner shall have the right to file, within ten days after receipt of the notice, objections to the plan of reconditioning as submitted by the storage operator. If no objections are filed and none are raised by the department within ten days, the storage operator may proceed with reconditioning in accordance with the plan as submitted. If an objection is filed or made by the department, the department shall fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251, at which conference the storage operator and the person having objections shall attempt to agree on a plan of reconditioning that meets the requirements of this section. If no agreement is reached, the department shall, by an appropriate order, determine whether the plan as submitted meets the requirements of this section or what changes should be made to meet the requirements. If, in reconditioning the well in accordance with the plan, physical conditions are encountered which justify or necessitate a change in the plan, the storage operator or coal operator may request that the plan be changed. If the parties cannot agree on a change, the department shall arrange for a conference to determine the matter in the same manner as set forth in connection with original objections to the plan. (4) Application may be made to the department in the manner prescribed in section 3221 for approval of an alternative method of reconditioning a well. When a well located within the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area has been reconditioned or drilled and equipped prior to April 18, 1985, and, on the basis of the data, information and other evidence submitted to the department, the obligations imposed by subsection (a) as to reconditioning the well shall be considered to be fully satisfied if it is determined that reconditioning or previous drilling and equipping: (i) was done in the manner required in this subsection, or in regulations promulgated hereunder, or in a manner approved as an alternative method in accordance with section 3221; or (ii) is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter. (5) If a well requires emergency repairs, this subsection shall not be construed to require the storage operator to give the notices specified herein before making the repairs. (g) Producing wells.-- If a well located within the reservoir protective area is a producing well in a stratum below the storage stratum, the obligations imposed by subsection (a) shall not begin until the well ceases to be a producing well. (h) Certain other wells.-- If a well within a storage reservoir or reservoir protective area penetrates the storage stratum but does not penetrate the coal seam being mined by an operating coal mine, the department may, upon application of the operator of the storage reservoir, exempt the well from the requirements of this section. Either party affected may request a conference under section 3251 with respect to exemption of a well covered by this subsection. (i) Plugging limitation.-- In fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a)(2) with respect to a well within the reservoir protective area, the storage operator shall not be required to plug or recondition the well until the storage operator has received from the coal operator written notice that the mine workings will, within the period stated in the notice, be within 2,000 linear feet of the well. Upon the receipt of the notice, the storage operator shall use due diligence to complete the plugging or reconditioning of the well in accordance with the requirements of this section and section 3220. If the mine workings do not, within a period of three years after the well has been plugged, come within 2,000 linear feet of the well, the coal operator shall reimburse the storage operator for the cost of plugging, provided that the well is still within the reservoir protective area as of that time. (j) Retreat mining.-- If retreat mining approaches a point where, within 90 days, it is expected that the retreat work will be at the location of the pillar surrounding an active storage well, the coal operator shall give written notice to the storage operator, and by agreement, the parties shall determine whether it is necessary or advisable to effectively and temporarily inactivate the well. The well shall not be reactivated until a reasonable period, determined by the parties, has elapsed. If the parties cannot agree as required by this subsection, the matter shall be submitted to the department for resolution. The number of wells required to be temporarily inactivated during the retreat period shall not be of a number that materially affects efficient operation of the storage pool, except that this provision shall not preclude temporary inactivation of a particular well if the practical effect of inactivating it is to render the pool temporarily inoperative. (k) Exceptions.-- The requirements of subsections (a), (l) and (m) shall not apply to injection of gas into a stratum when the whole purpose of injection, referred to in this subsection as testing, is to determine whether the stratum is suitable for storage purposes. Testing shall be conducted only in compliance with the following requirements: (1) The person testing or proposing to test shall comply with all provisions and requirements of section 3231 and verify the statement required to be filed by that section. (2) If any part of the proposed storage reservoir is under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine which is operating in a coal seam that extends over the proposed storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area, the storage operator shall give at least six months' written notice to the department and coal operator of the fact that injection of gas for testing purposes is proposed. (3) The coal operator affected may at any time file objections with the department, whereupon the department shall fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251, not more than ten days from the date of the notice to the storage operator. At the conference, the storage operator and the objecting party shall attempt to agree, subject to approval of the department, on the questions involved. If an agreement cannot be reached, the department may issue an appropriate order. (4) If at any time a proposed storage reservoir being tested comes under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine because of extension of the storage reservoir being tested or because of extension or establishment or reestablishment of the operating coal mine, the requirements of this subsection shall immediately become applicable to the testing. (l) Storage reservoirs near operating coal mines.-- A person who proposes to establish a storage reservoir under or within 2,000 linear feet of a coal mine operating in a coal seam that extends over the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area shall, prior to establishing the reservoir, and in addition to complying with section 3231 and subsection (a), file the verified statement required by subsection (b) and fully comply with any order of the department in the manner provided under subsection (b) or (c) before commencing operation of the storage reservoir. After the person proposing to operate the storage reservoir complies with the requirements of this subsection and commences operations, the person shall continue to be subject to all provisions of this chapter. (m) Gas storage reservoirs.-- If a gas storage reservoir is in operation on April 18, 1985, and at any time thereafter it is under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine, or if a gas storage reservoir is put in operation after April 18, 1985, and at any time after storage operations begin it is under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine, the storage operator shall comply with all of the provisions of this section, except that: (1) the time for filing the verified statement under subsection (b) shall be 60 days after the date stated in the notice filed by the coal operator under section 3232(d) and (e) (relating to reporting requirements for coal mining operations); (2) the coal operator shall give notice of the delay to the department; (3) the department shall, upon the request of the storage operator, extend the time for filing the statement by the additional time which will be required to extend or establish or reestablish the operating coal mine to a point within 2,000 linear feet of the reservoir; (4) the verified statement shall also indicate that the map referred to in section 3231(a) has been currently amended as of the time of the filing of the statement; and (5) the person operating the storage reservoir shall continue to be subject to all of the provisions of this chapter. (n) Failure to comply with order.-- If, in any proceeding under this chapter, the department determines that an operator of a storage reservoir has failed to comply with a lawful order issued under this chapter, the department may require the storage operator to suspend operation of the reservoir and withdraw the gas from it until the violation is remedied, in which case the storage operator, limited by due diligence insofar as existing facilities utilized to remove gas from the reservoir will permit, shall: (1) if possible, remove the amount required by the department to be removed; or (2) in any event, remove the maximum amount which can be withdrawn in accordance with recognized engineering and operating procedures. (o) Prevention of escape of gas.-- In addition to initial compliance with other provisions of this chapter and lawful orders issued under this chapter, it shall be the duty, at all times, of a person owning or operating a storage reservoir subject to this chapter to keep all wells drilled into or through the storage stratum in a condition, and operate the wells in a manner, which is designed to prevent the escape of gas out of the storage reservoir and its facilities, and to operate and maintain the storage reservoir and its facilities in the manner prescribed by regulation of the department and at a pressure that will prevent gas from escaping from the reservoir or its facilities. This duty shall not be construed to include inability to prevent the escape of gas when escape results from an act of God or a person not under the control of the storage operator, except that this exception does not apply to a well which the storage operator has failed to locate and make known to the department. If an escape of gas results from an act of God or a person not under the control of the storage operator, the storage operator shall be under the duty to take any action reasonably necessary to prevent the further escape of gas out of the storage reservoir and its facilities.",

      "text": "§ 3241. Appropriation of interest in real property. (a) General rule.-- Except as provided in this subsection, a corporation empowered to transport, sell or store natural gas or manufactured gas in this Commonwealth may appropriate an interest in real property located in a storage reservoir or reservoir protective area for injection, storage and removal from storage of natural gas or manufactured gas in a stratum which is or previously has been commercially productive of natural gas. The right granted by this subsection shall not be exercised to acquire any of the following for the purpose of gas storage: (1) An interest in a geological stratum within the area of a proposed storage reservoir or reservoir protective area: (i) unless the original recoverable oil or gas reserves in the proposed storage reservoir have been depleted or exhausted by at least 80%; and (ii) until the condemnor has acquired the right, by grant, lease or other agreement, to store gas in the geological stratum underlying at least 75% of the area of the proposed storage reservoir. (2) An interest in a geological stratum within the area of a proposed storage reservoir or reservoir protective area owned directly or indirectly by a gas company or other person engaged in local distribution of natural gas, if the interest to be acquired is presently being used by the gas company or other person for storage of gas in performance of service to customers in its service area. (b) Construction.-- The following shall apply: (1) This chapter authorizes appropriation within a storage reservoir or reservoir protective area of the following: (i) a stratum to be used for storage; (ii) any gas reserve remaining a stratum to be used for storage; (iii) an active or abandoned well or wells drilled into a stratum to be used for storage; and (iv) the right to enter upon and use the surface of lands to: (A) locate, recondition, maintain, plug or replug an active or abandoned well; or (B) operate a well drilled into or through a stratum to be used for storage. (2) This chapter does not preclude the owner of nonstorage strata from drilling wells to produce oil or gas from a stratum above or below the storage stratum appropriated by another person, but a person appropriating or holding storage rights may access, inspect and examine the drilling, the completed well, drilling logs and other records relating to drilling, equipping or operating the well in order to determine whether the storage stratum is being adequately protected to prevent escape of gas stored therein. (3) This chapter does not authorize appropriation of a coal or coal measure, regardless of whether it is being mined, or an interest in the coal mine or coal measure. (c) Activities through appropriated strata.-- A person drilling, operating, using or plugging a well through a stratum appropriated under this chapter shall drill, case, equip, operate or plug it in a manner designed to prevent avoidable escape of gas that may be stored in the storage stratum. Upon violation of this subsection, the court of common pleas of the county where the land in question is situated may compel compliance by injunction or grant other appropriate relief in an action brought by the person storing gas in the storage stratum. (d) Prerequisites to appropriation.-- Before appropriating under this chapter, a person shall attempt to agree with owners of interests in the real property involved as to damages payable for rights and interests to be appropriated, if the owners can be found and are sui juris. If the parties fail to agree, the person shall tender a surety bond to the owners to secure them in the payment of damages. If the owners refuse to accept the bond, cannot be found or are not sui juris, and after reasonable notice to the owners by advertisement or otherwise, the bond shall be presented for approval to the court of common pleas of the county in which the tract of land is situated. Upon the approval of the bond by the court, the right of the person to appropriate in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall be complete. (e) Appointment of viewers.-- Upon petition of a property owner or a person appropriating under this chapter, the court shall: (1) appoint three disinterested freeholders of the county to serve as viewers to assess damages to be paid to the property owner for the rights appropriated; (2) fix a time for the parties to meet; (3) provide notice to the parties; and (4) after the viewers have filed their report, fix reasonable compensation for the service of the viewers. (f) Appeal.-- Within 20 days after the filing of a report by viewers appointed under subsection (e), a party may appeal and proceed to a jury trial as in ordinary cases.

Failure to comply with the time period under this section shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty. The civil penalty shall be payable to the Commonwealth and collectible in any manner provided at law for collection of debts. If a violator neglects or refuses to pay the penalty after demand, the amount, together with interest and costs that may accrue, shall become a lien in favor of the Commonwealth on the real and personal property of the violator, but only after the lien has been entered and docketed of record by the prothonotary of the county where the property is situated. The department may transmit to the prothonotaries of the various counties certified copies of all liens. It shall be the duty of each prothonotary to enter and docket the liens of record in the prothonotary's office and index them as judgments are indexed, without requiring payment of costs as a condition precedent to entry.

(a) General rule.-- A person who operates or proposes to operate a storage reservoir, except one filled by the secondary recovery or gas recycling process, shall: (1) Use every known method which is reasonable under the circumstances for discovering and locating all wells which have or may have been drilled into or through the storage reservoir. (2) Plug or recondition, as provided in departmental regulations, all known wells drilled into or through the storage reservoir, except to the extent otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c). (b) Wells to be plugged.-- To comply with subsection (a), wells which are to be plugged shall be plugged in the manner specified in section 3220 (relating to plugging requirements). (b.1) Wells plugged prior to enactment of section.-- If a well located in the storage reservoir area has been plugged prior to April 18, 1985, and on the basis of data, information and other evidence submitted to the department, it is determined that the plugging was done in the manner required by section 3220 or approved as an alternative method under section 3221 (relating to alternative methods) and the plugging is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter, the obligations under subsection (a) with regard to plugging the well shall be considered to have been fully satisfied. (c) Wells to be reconditioned.-- The following shall apply: (1) To comply with subsection (a), wells which are to be reconditioned shall, unless the department by regulation specifies a different procedure, be cleaned out from the surface through the storage horizon, and the producing casing and casing strings determined not to be in good physical condition shall be replaced with new casing, using the same procedure as is applicable to drilling a new well under this chapter. In the case of wells to be used for gas storage, the annular space between each string of casing and the annular space behind the largest diameter casing to the extent possible shall be filled to the surface with cement or bentonitic mud or a nonporous material approved by the department under section 3221. At least 15 days prior to reconditioning, the storage operator shall give notice to the department, setting forth in the notice the manner in which it is planned to recondition the well and any pertinent data known to the storage operator which will indicate the condition of the well existing at that time. In addition, the storage operator shall give the department at least 72 hours' notice of the time when reconditioning is to begin. If no objections are raised by the department within ten days, the storage operator may proceed with reconditioning in accordance with the plan as submitted. If objections are made by the department, the department may fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251 (relating to conferences) at which the storage operator and department shall endeavor to agree on a plan to satisfy the objections and meet the requirements of this section. If no agreement is reached, the department may, by an appropriate order, determine whether the plan, as submitted, meets the requirements of this section or what changes, if any, are required. If, in reconditioning a well in accordance with the plan, physical conditions are encountered which justify or necessitate a change in the plan, the storage operator may request that the plan be changed. If the request is denied, the department shall fix a conference under section 3251 and proceed in the same manner as with original objections. An application may be made in the manner prescribed by section 3221 for approval of an alternative method of reconditioning a well. If a well located within the storage reservoir was reconditioned, or drilled and equipped, prior to April 18, 1985, the obligations imposed by subsection (a), as to reconditioning the well, shall be considered fully satisfied if, on the basis of the data, information and other evidence submitted to the department, it is determined that: (i) The conditioning or previous drilling and equipping was done in the manner required in this subsection, in regulations promulgated under this chapter or in a manner approved as an alternative method in accordance with section 3221. (ii) The reconditioning or previous drilling and equipping is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter. (2) If a well requires emergency repairs, this chapter shall not be construed to require the storage operator to give any notice required by this subsection before making the repairs. (d) Exception.-- The requirements of subsection (a) shall not apply to injection of gas into a stratum when the sole purpose of injection, referred to in this subsection as testing, is to determine whether the stratum is suitable for storage purposes. Testing shall be conducted only in compliance with the following requirements: (1) The person testing or proposing to test shall comply with section 3231 (relating to reporting requirements for gas storage operations) and verify the statement required to be filed by that section. (2) The storage operator shall give at least six months' written notice to the department of the fact that injection of gas for testing purposes is proposed. (3) If the department has objections, the department shall fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251, not more than ten days from the date of notice to the storage operator, at which time the storage operator and department shall attempt to resolve the issues presented. If an agreement cannot be reached, the department may issue an appropriate order. (e) Failure to execute lawful order.-- In a proceeding under this chapter, if the department determines that an operator of a storage reservoir has failed to carry out a lawful order issued under this chapter, the department may require the operator to suspend operation of the reservoir and withdraw the gas until the violation is remedied, in which case the storage operator, limited by due diligence insofar as existing facilities utilized to remove gas from the reservoir will permit, shall: (1) if possible, remove the amount required by the department to be removed; or (2) in any event, remove the maximum amount which can be withdrawn in accordance with recognized engineering and operating procedures. (f) Duty of storage reservoir operator.-- The following shall apply: (1) A person owning or operating a storage reservoir subject to this chapter shall have a duty to: (i) Maintain all wells drilled into or through the reservoir in a condition and operate them in a manner sufficient to prevent the escape of gas. (ii) Operate and maintain the reservoir and its facilities as prescribed by departmental regulations and at a pressure which will prevent gas from escaping, but the pressure shall not exceed the highest rock pressure found to have existed during the production history of the reservoir or another high pressure limit approved by the department after holding a conference under section 3251 based on geological and production knowledge of the reservoir, its character, permeability distribution and operating experience. (2) The duty under paragraph (1) shall not be construed to include inability to prevent the escape of gas when gas escapes as a result of an act of God or a person not under the control of the storage operator. In that instance, the storage operator shall have a duty to take action reasonably necessary to prevent the further escape of gas. This paragraph does not apply to a well which the storage operator failed to locate and make known to the department.",

If an objection is raised as to use of a well as a storage well and, after a conference under section 3251 (relating to conferences), it is determined by the department, taking into account all circumstances and conditions, that the well should not be used as a storage well, the well shall be plugged unless, in the opinion of the storage operator, the well may be used as a storage well in the future, in which case, upon approval of the department after taking into account all circumstances and conditions, the storage operator may recondition and inactivate the well rather than plug it. (3) The requirements of paragraph (2) shall be deemed to have been fully complied with if, as the operating coal mine is extended, all wells which from time to time come within the acreage described in paragraph (2) are reconditioned or plugged as provided in section 3220 and subsection (e) or (f) so that, by the time the coal mine has reached a point within 2,000 linear feet of the wells, they will have been reconditioned or plugged in accordance with section 3220 and subsection (e) or (f). (b) Verified statement.-- A person operating a storage reservoir referred to in subsection (a) shall file with the department and furnish a copy to the person operating the affected operating coal mine a verified statement setting forth: (1) That the map and any supplemental maps required by section 3231(a) (relating to reporting requirements for gas storage operations) have been prepared and filed in accordance with section 3231.

(c) Procedure.-- Within 120 days after receipt of a statement required by this section, the department may direct that a conference be held in accordance with section 3251 to determine whether the requirements of section 3231 and subsection (a) have been fully met. At the conference, if any person believes the requirements have not been fully met, the parties shall attempt to agree on additional actions to be taken and the time for completion, subject to approval of the department. If an agreement cannot be reached, the department shall make a determination and, if the department determines any requirements have not been met, the department shall issue an order specifying in detail the extent to which the requirements have not been met and the actions which the storage operator must complete to meet the requirements. The order shall grant as much time as is reasonably necessary to fully comply. If the storage operator encounters conditions not known to exist at the time of issuance of the order and which materially affect the validity of the order or the ability of the storage operator to comply with it, the storage operator may apply for a rehearing or modification of the order. (d) Notification.-- If, in complying with subsection (a), a storage operator, after filing the statement provided for in subsection (b), plugs or reconditions a well, the storage operator shall notify the department and the coal operator affected, in writing, setting forth facts indicating the manner in which the plugging or reconditioning was done. Upon receipt of the notification, the coal operator or department may request a conference under section 3251. (e) Plugging wells.-- In order to meet the requirements of subsection (a), wells which are to be plugged shall be plugged in the manner specified in regulations promulgated under section 3211 (relating to well permits). When a well located within the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area has been plugged prior to April 18, 1985, and, on the basis of the data information and other evidence submitted to the department, it is determined that the plugging was done in the manner required by section 3220, or in a manner approved as an alternative method in accordance with section 3221 (relating to alternative methods), and the plugging is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter, the requirements of subsection (a) as to plugging the well shall be considered to have been fully satisfied. (f) Reconditioned wells.-- The following shall apply: (1) In order to comply with subsection (a), unless the department by regulation specifies a different procedure, wells which are to be reconditioned shall be cleaned out from the surface through the storage horizon, and the following casing strings shall be pulled and replaced with new casing, using the procedure applicable to drilling a new well under this chapter: (i) the producing casing; (ii) the largest diameter casing passing through the lowest workable coal seam unless it extends at least 25 feet below the bottom of the coal seam and is determined to be in good physical condition, but the storage operator may, instead of replacing the largest diameter casing, replace the next largest casing string if the casing string extends at least 25 feet below the lowest workable coal seam; and (iii) casing strings determined not to be in good physical condition. (2) In the case of a well to be used for gas storage, the annular space between each string of casing and the annular space behind the largest diameter casing, to the extent possible, shall be filled to the surface with cement or bentonitic mud or an equally nonporous material approved by the department under section 3221. (3) At least 15 days before a well is to be reconditioned, the storage operator shall give notice to the department and the coal operator, lessee or owner, setting forth the manner in which reconditioning is planned and pertinent data known to the storage operator which will indicate the current condition of the well, along with at least 72 hours' notice of the date and time when reconditioning will begin. The coal operator, lessee or owner shall have the right to file, within ten days after receipt of the notice, objections to the plan of reconditioning as submitted by the storage operator. If no objections are filed and none are raised by the department within ten days, the storage operator may proceed with reconditioning in accordance with the plan as submitted. If an objection is filed or made by the department, the department shall fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251, at which conference the storage operator and the person having objections shall attempt to agree on a plan of reconditioning that meets the requirements of this section. If no agreement is reached, the department shall, by an appropriate order, determine whether the plan as submitted meets the requirements of this section or what changes should be made to meet the requirements. If, in reconditioning the well in accordance with the plan, physical conditions are encountered which justify or necessitate a change in the plan, the storage operator or coal operator may request that the plan be changed. If the parties cannot agree on a change, the department shall arrange for a conference to determine the matter in the same manner as set forth in connection with original objections to the plan. (4) Application may be made to the department in the manner prescribed in section 3221 for approval of an alternative method of reconditioning a well. When a well located within the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area has been reconditioned or drilled and equipped prior to April 18, 1985, and, on the basis of the data, information and other evidence submitted to the department, the obligations imposed by subsection (a) as to reconditioning the well shall be considered to be fully satisfied if it is determined that reconditioning or previous drilling and equipping: (i) was done in the manner required in this subsection, or in regulations promulgated hereunder, or in a manner approved as an alternative method in accordance with section 3221; or (ii) is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter. (5) If a well requires emergency repairs, this subsection shall not be construed to require the storage operator to give the notices specified herein before making the repairs. (g) Producing wells.-- If a well located within the reservoir protective area is a producing well in a stratum below the storage stratum, the obligations imposed by subsection (a) shall not begin until the well ceases to be a producing well. (h) Certain other wells.-- If a well within a storage reservoir or reservoir protective area penetrates the storage stratum but does not penetrate the coal seam being mined by an operating coal mine, the department may, upon application of the operator of the storage reservoir, exempt the well from the requirements of this section. Either party affected may request a conference under section 3251 with respect to exemption of a well covered by this subsection. (i) Plugging limitation.-- In fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a)(2) with respect to a well within the reservoir protective area, the storage operator shall not be required to plug or recondition the well until the storage operator has received from the coal operator written notice that the mine workings will, within the period stated in the notice, be within 2,000 linear feet of the well. Upon the receipt of the notice, the storage operator shall use due diligence to complete the plugging or reconditioning of the well in accordance with the requirements of this section and section 3220. If the mine workings do not, within a period of three years after the well has been plugged, come within 2,000 linear feet of the well, the coal operator shall reimburse the storage operator for the cost of plugging, provided that the well is still within the reservoir protective area as of that time. (j) Retreat mining.-- If retreat mining approaches a point where, within 90 days, it is expected that the retreat work will be at the location of the pillar surrounding an active storage well, the coal operator shall give written notice to the storage operator, and by agreement, the parties shall determine whether it is necessary or advisable to effectively and temporarily inactivate the well. The well shall not be reactivated until a reasonable period, determined by the parties, has elapsed. If the parties cannot agree as required by this subsection, the matter shall be submitted to the department for resolution. The number of wells required to be temporarily inactivated during the retreat period shall not be of a number that materially affects efficient operation of the storage pool, except that this provision shall not preclude temporary inactivation of a particular well if the practical effect of inactivating it is to render the pool temporarily inoperative. (k) Exceptions.-- The requirements of subsections (a), (l) and (m) shall not apply to injection of gas into a stratum when the whole purpose of injection, referred to in this subsection as testing, is to determine whether the stratum is suitable for storage purposes. Testing shall be conducted only in compliance with the following requirements: (1) The person testing or proposing to test shall comply with all provisions and requirements of section 3231 and verify the statement required to be filed by that section. (2) If any part of the proposed storage reservoir is under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine which is operating in a coal seam that extends over the proposed storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area, the storage operator shall give at least six months' written notice to the department and coal operator of the fact that injection of gas for testing purposes is proposed. (3) The coal operator affected may at any time file objections with the department, whereupon the department shall fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251, not more than ten days from the date of the notice to the storage operator. At the conference, the storage operator and the objecting party shall attempt to agree, subject to approval of the department, on the questions involved. If an agreement cannot be reached, the department may issue an appropriate order. (4) If at any time a proposed storage reservoir being tested comes under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine because of extension of the storage reservoir being tested or because of extension or establishment or reestablishment of the operating coal mine, the requirements of this subsection shall immediately become applicable to the testing. (l) Storage reservoirs near operating coal mines.-- A person who proposes to establish a storage reservoir under or within 2,000 linear feet of a coal mine operating in a coal seam that extends over the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area shall, prior to establishing the reservoir, and in addition to complying with section 3231 and subsection (a), file the verified statement required by subsection (b) and fully comply with any order of the department in the manner provided under subsection (b) or (c) before commencing operation of the storage reservoir. After the person proposing to operate the storage reservoir complies with the requirements of this subsection and commences operations, the person shall continue to be subject to all provisions of this chapter. (m) Gas storage reservoirs.-- If a gas storage reservoir is in operation on April 18, 1985, and at any time thereafter it is under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine, or if a gas storage reservoir is put in operation after April 18, 1985, and at any time after storage operations begin it is under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine, the storage operator shall comply with all of the provisions of this section, except that: (1) the time for filing the verified statement under subsection (b) shall be 60 days after the date stated in the notice filed by the coal operator under section 3232(d) and (e) (relating to reporting requirements for coal mining operations); (2) the coal operator shall give notice of the delay to the department; (3) the department shall, upon the request of the storage operator, extend the time for filing the statement by the additional time which will be required to extend or establish or reestablish the operating coal mine to a point within 2,000 linear feet of the reservoir; (4) the verified statement shall also indicate that the map referred to in section 3231(a) has been currently amended as of the time of the filing of the statement; and (5) the person operating the storage reservoir shall continue to be subject to all of the provisions of this chapter. (n) Failure to comply with order.-- If, in any proceeding under this chapter, the department determines that an operator of a storage reservoir has failed to comply with a lawful order issued under this chapter, the department may require the storage operator to suspend operation of the reservoir and withdraw the gas from it until the violation is remedied, in which case the storage operator, limited by due diligence insofar as existing facilities utilized to remove gas from the reservoir will permit, shall: (1) if possible, remove the amount required by the department to be removed; or (2) in any event, remove the maximum amount which can be withdrawn in accordance with recognized engineering and operating procedures. (o) Prevention of escape of gas.-- In addition to initial compliance with other provisions of this chapter and lawful orders issued under this chapter, it shall be the duty, at all times, of a person owning or operating a storage reservoir subject to this chapter to keep all wells drilled into or through the storage stratum in a condition, and operate the wells in a manner, which is designed to prevent the escape of gas out of the storage reservoir and its facilities, and to operate and maintain the storage reservoir and its facilities in the manner prescribed by regulation of the department and at a pressure that will prevent gas from escaping from the reservoir or its facilities. This duty shall not be construed to include inability to prevent the escape of gas when escape results from an act of God or a person not under the control of the storage operator, except that this exception does not apply to a well which the storage operator has failed to locate and make known to the department. If an escape of gas results from an act of God or a person not under the control of the storage operator, the storage operator shall be under the duty to take any action reasonably necessary to prevent the further escape of gas out of the storage reservoir and its facilities.",

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided in this subsection, a corporation empowered to transport, sell or store natural gas or manufactured gas in this Commonwealth may appropriate an interest in real property located in a storage reservoir or reservoir protective area for injection, storage and removal from storage of natural gas or manufactured gas in a stratum which is or previously has been commercially productive of natural gas. The right granted by this subsection shall not be exercised to acquire any of the following for the purpose of gas storage: (1) An interest in a geological stratum within the area of a proposed storage reservoir or reservoir protective area: (i) unless the original recoverable oil or gas reserves in the proposed storage reservoir have been depleted or exhausted by at least 80%; and (ii) until the condemnor has acquired the right, by grant, lease or other agreement, to store gas in the geological stratum underlying at least 75% of the area of the proposed storage reservoir. (2) An interest in a geological stratum within the area of a proposed storage reservoir or reservoir protective area owned directly or indirectly by a gas company or other person engaged in local distribution of natural gas, if the interest to be acquired is presently being used by the gas company or other person for storage of gas in performance of service to customers in its service area. (b) Construction.-- The following shall apply: (1) This chapter authorizes appropriation within a storage reservoir or reservoir protective area of the following: (i) a stratum to be used for storage; (ii) any gas reserve remaining a stratum to be used for storage; (iii) an active or abandoned well or wells drilled into a stratum to be used for storage; and (iv) the right to enter upon and use the surface of lands to: (A) locate, recondition, maintain, plug or replug an active or abandoned well; or (B) operate a well drilled into or through a stratum to be used for storage. (2) This chapter does not preclude the owner of nonstorage strata from drilling wells to produce oil or gas from a stratum above or below the storage stratum appropriated by another person, but a person appropriating or holding storage rights may access, inspect and examine the drilling, the completed well, drilling logs and other records relating to drilling, equipping or operating the well in order to determine whether the storage stratum is being adequately protected to prevent escape of gas stored therein. (3) This chapter does not authorize appropriation of a coal or coal measure, regardless of whether it is being mined, or an interest in the coal mine or coal measure. (c) Activities through appropriated strata.-- A person drilling, operating, using or plugging a well through a stratum appropriated under this chapter shall drill, case, equip, operate or plug it in a manner designed to prevent avoidable escape of gas that may be stored in the storage stratum. Upon violation of this subsection, the court of common pleas of the county where the land in question is situated may compel compliance by injunction or grant other appropriate relief in an action brought by the person storing gas in the storage stratum. (d) Prerequisites to appropriation.-- Before appropriating under this chapter, a person shall attempt to agree with owners of interests in the real property involved as to damages payable for rights and interests to be appropriated, if the owners can be found and are sui juris. If the parties fail to agree, the person shall tender a surety bond to the owners to secure them in the payment of damages. If the owners refuse to accept the bond, cannot be found or are not sui juris, and after reasonable notice to the owners by advertisement or otherwise, the bond shall be presented for approval to the court of common pleas of the county in which the tract of land is situated. Upon the approval of the bond by the court, the right of the person to appropriate in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall be complete. (e) Appointment of viewers.-- Upon petition of a property owner or a person appropriating under this chapter, the court shall: (1) appoint three disinterested freeholders of the county to serve as viewers to assess damages to be paid to the property owner for the rights appropriated; (2) fix a time for the parties to meet; (3) provide notice to the parties; and (4) after the viewers have filed their report, fix reasonable compensation for the service of the viewers. (f) Appeal.-- Within 20 days after the filing of a report by viewers appointed under subsection (e), a party may appeal and proceed to a jury trial as in ordinary cases.
