      "text": "(a) General rule.--Upon abandoning a well, the owner or operator shall plug it in the manner prescribed by regulation of the department to stop vertical flow of fluids or gas within the well bore, unless the department has granted inactive status for the well or it has been approved by the department as an orphan well. If the department determines that a prior owner or operator received economic benefit, other than economic benefit derived only as a landowner or from a royalty interest, after April 18, 1979, from an orphan well or an unregistered well, the owner or operator shall be responsible for plugging the well. In the case of a gas well penetrating a workable coal seam which was drilled prior to January 30, 1956, or which was permitted after that date but not plugged in accordance with this chapter, if the owner or operator or a coal operator or an agent proposes to plug the well to allow mining through it, the gas well shall be cleaned to a depth of at least 200 feet below the coal seam through which mining is proposed and, unless impracticable, to a point 200 feet below the deepest mineable coal seam. The gas well shall be plugged from that depth in accordance with section 13 of the act of December 18, 1984 (P.L.1069, No.214), known as the Coal and Gas Resource Coordination Act, and the regulations of the department.\n\n(b) Areas underlain by coal.--Prior to the plugging and abandonment of a well in an area underlain by a workable coal seam, the well operator or owner shall notify the department and the coal operator, lessee or owner and submit a plat, on a form to be furnished by the department, showing the location of the well and fixing the date and time plugging will commence, which shall be not less than three working days, nor more than 30 days, after the notice is received, to permit representatives of the persons notified to be present at the plugging. Notice and the right to be present may be waived by the department and the coal operator, lessee or owner, but waiver by the coal operator, lessee or owner shall be in writing and a copy shall be attached to the notice of abandonment filed with the department under this section. Whether or not representatives attend, if the well operator has fully complied with this section, the well operator may proceed, at the time fixed, to plug the well in the manner prescribed by regulation of the department. When plugging has been completed, a certificate shall be prepared and signed, on a form to be furnished by the department, by two experienced and qualified people who participated in the work setting forth the time and manner in which the well was plugged. One copy of the certificate shall be mailed to each coal operator, lessee or owner to whom notice was given by certified mail and another shall be mailed to the department.\n\n(c) Abandoned wells.--Prior to abandonment of a well, except an uncompleted bore hole plugged immediately upon suspension of drilling in an area not underlain by a workable coal seam, the well operator shall notify the department of the intention to plug and abandon the well and submit a plat, on a form to be furnished by the department, showing the location of the well and fixing the date and time at which plugging will commence, which shall be not less than three working days, nor more than 30 days, after the notice is received, to permit a department representative to be present at the plugging. The notice or waiting period may be verbally waived by the department. In noncoal areas where more than one well has been drilled as part of the same development project and the wells are now to be plugged, the department shall be given three working days' notice prior to plugging the first well of the project, subject to waiver of notice described in subsection (b). In the plugging of subsequent wells, no additional notice shall be required if plugging on the project is continuous. If plugging of subsequent wells is delayed for any reason, notice shall be given to the department of continuation of the project. Whether or not a representative attends, if the well operator has fully complied with this section, the well operator may proceed, at the time fixed, to plug the well in the manner prescribed by regulation of the department. When plugging has been completed, a certificate shall be prepared, on a form to be furnished by the department, by two experienced and qualified people who participated in the work setting forth the time and manner in which the well was plugged. A copy of the certificate shall be mailed to the department.\n\n(d) Wells abandoned upon completion of drilling.--If a well is to be abandoned immediately after completion of drilling, the well operator shall give at least 24 hours' notice by telephone, confirmed by certified mail, to the department and to the coal operator, lessee or owner, if any, fixing the date and time when plugging will commence. Notice and the right to be present may be waived by the department and the coal operator, lessee or owner, if any. Whether or not representatives of the department or coal operator, lessee or owner, if any, attend, if the well operator has fully complied with the requirements of this section, the well operator may proceed, at the time fixed, to plug the well in the manner provided by regulation of the department. The well operator shall prepare the certificate of plugging and mail copies of the same as provided in subsection (b).\n\n(e) Orphan wells.--If a well is an orphan well or abandoned without plugging or if a well is in operation but not registered under section 3213 (relating to well registration and identification), the department may enter upon the well site and plug the well and sell equipment, casing and pipe at the site which may have been used in production of the well in order to recover the costs of plugging. The department shall make an effort to determine ownership of a well which is in operation but has not been registered and provide written notice to the owner of pending action under this subsection. If the department cannot determine ownership within 30 days, it may proceed under this subsection. Costs of plugging shall have priority over all liens on equipment, casing and pipe, and the sale shall be free and clear of those liens to the extent that the cost of plugging exceeds the sale price. If the amount obtained for casing and pipe salvaged at the site is inadequate to pay for plugging, the owner or operator of the abandoned or unregistered well shall be liable for the additional costs.\n\n(f) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \"owner\" does not include the owner or possessor of surface real property, on which an abandoned well is located, who did not participate or incur costs in and had no right of control over the drilling or extraction operation of the abandoned well.\n\nCross References.Section 3220 is referred to in sections 2823, 2824, 2824, 3203, 3211, 3214, 3233, 3234, 3252, 3259 of this title.",

The amount of the bond required shall be in the following amounts and amounts under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) may be adjusted by the Environmental Quality Board every two years to reflect the projected costs to the Commonwealth of plugging the well:\n\n(i) For unconventional wells with a total well bore length less than 6,000 feet:\n\n(A) For operating up to 50 wells, $4,000 per well, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $35,000.\n\n(B) For operating 51 to 150 wells, $35,000 plus $4,000 per well for each well in excess of 50 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $60,000.\n\n(C) For operating 151 to 250 wells, $60,000 plus $4,000 per well for each well in excess of 150 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $100,000.\n\n(D) For operating more than 250 wells, $100,000 plus $4,000 per well for each well in excess of 250 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $250,000.\n\n(ii) For unconventional wells with a total well bore length of at least 6,000 feet:\n\n(A) For operating up to 25 wells, $10,000 per well, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $140,000.\n\n(B) For operating 26 to 50 wells, $140,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 25 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $290,000.\n\n(C) For operating 51 to 150 wells, $290,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 50 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $430,000.\n\n(D) For operating more than 150 wells, $430,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 150 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $600,000.\n\n(iii) For a well other than an unconventional well, $2,500 per well. For 10 years following the effective date of this subparagraph, the Environmental Quality Board and the department shall have no authority to adjust the amount under this subparagraph.\n\n(2) The following apply:\n\n(i) Except as provided under subparagraph (ii), in lieu of individual bonds for each well, an owner or operator may file a blanket bond for the applicable amount under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii), on a form prepared by the department, covering all of its wells in this Commonwealth, as enumerated on the bond form.\n\n(ii) As follows:\n\n(A) An operator may file a blanket bond of $25,000 for all of the operator's wells in this Commonwealth that are not unconventional wells.\n\n(B) For every new well that is not an unconventional well drilled after six months after the effective date of this subsection, the bond amount for that operator shall increase by $1,000.\n\n(C) The total blanket bond for an operator's wells that are not unconventional wells shall not exceed $100,000.\n\n(D) The blanket bond increase of $1,000 shall be waived by the department for a new well drilled under this subsection if the operator provides evidence to the department that the operator has plugged an orphan well at the operator's own expense for which the operator was not the responsible party within the previous 365 days that the operator has not yet received credit for under this subsection by the department.\n\n(E) For 10 years following the effective date of this clause, the bond amounts for wells that are not unconventional wells may only be revised by the General Assembly. The Environmental Quality Board and the department shall have no authority to adjust bond amounts related to wells that are not unconventional wells during that time period.\n\n(2.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, section 1934-A of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929, shall continue to apply to a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985.\n\n(3) Liability under the bond shall continue until the well has been properly plugged in accordance with this chapter and for a period of one year after filing of the certificate of plugging with the department. Each bond shall be executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do business in this Commonwealth and approved by the secretary. In lieu of a corporate surety, the operator may deposit with the department:\n\n(ii) certificates of deposit or automatically renewable irrevocable letters of credit, from financial institutions chartered or authorized to do business in this Commonwealth and regulated and examined by the Commonwealth or a Federal agency, which may be terminated at the end of a term only upon 90 days' prior written notice by the financial institution to the permittee and the department;\n\n(iii) negotiable bonds of the United States Government or the Commonwealth, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, the General State Authority, the State Public School Building Authority or any municipality within the Commonwealth; or\n\n(iv) United States Treasury Bonds issued at a discount without a regular schedule of interest payments to maturity, otherwise known as Zero Coupon Bonds, having a maturity date of not more than ten years after the date of purchase and at the maturity date having a value of not less than the applicable amount under paragraph (1). The cash deposit, certificate of deposit, amount of the irrevocable letter of credit or market value of the securities shall be equal at least to the sum of the bond.\n\n(4) The secretary shall, upon receipt of a deposit of cash, letters of credit or negotiable bonds, immediately place the same with the State Treasurer, whose duty it shall be to receive and hold the same in the name of the Commonwealth, in trust, for the purpose for which the deposit is made.\n\n(5) The State Treasurer shall at all times be responsible for custody and safekeeping of deposits. The operator making the deposit shall be entitled from time to time to demand and receive from the State Treasurer, on the written order of the secretary, the whole or any portion of collateral deposited, upon depositing with the State Treasurer, in lieu of that collateral, other collateral of classes specified in this section having a market value at least equal to the sum of the bond, and also to demand, receive and recover the interest and income from the negotiable bonds as they become due and payable.\n\n(6) If negotiable bonds on deposit under this subsection mature or are called, the State Treasurer, at the request of the owner of the bonds, shall convert them into other negotiable bonds, of classes specified in this section, designated by the owner.\n\n(7) If notice of intent to terminate a letter of credit is given, the department shall give the operator 30 days' written notice to replace the letter of credit with other acceptable bond guarantees as provided in this section. If the owner or operator fails to timely replace the letter of credit, the department shall draw upon and convert the letter of credit into cash and hold it as a collateral bond guarantee.\n\n(b) Release.--No bond shall be fully released until the requirements of subsection (a) and section 3223 (relating to notification and effect of well transfer) have been fully met. Upon release of bonds and collateral under this section, the State Treasurer shall immediately return to the owner the specified amount of cash or securities.\n\n(c) Noncompliance.--If a well owner or operator fails or refuses to comply with subsection (a), regulations promulgated under this chapter or conditions of a permit relating to this chapter, the department may declare the bond forfeited and shall certify the same to the Attorney General, who shall proceed to enforce and collect the full amount of the bond and, if the well owner or operator has deposited cash or securities as collateral in lieu of a corporate surety, the department shall declare the collateral forfeited and direct the State Treasurer to pay the full amount of the funds into the Well Plugging Restricted Revenue Account or to sell the security to the extent forfeited and pay the proceeds into the Well Plugging Restricted Revenue Account. If a corporate surety or financial institution fails to pay a forfeited bond promptly and in full, the corporate surety or financial institution shall be disqualified from writing further bonds under this chapter or any other environmental law administered by the department. A person aggrieved by reason of forfeiting the bond or converting collateral, as provided in this section, shall have a right to appeal to the Environmental Hearing Board in the manner provided by law. Upon forfeiture of a blanket bond for a violation occurring at one or more well sites, the person whose bond is forfeited shall, within ten days of the forfeiture, submit a replacement bond to cover all other wells of which the person is an owner or operator. Failure to submit the replacement bond constitutes a violation of this section as to each of the wells owned or operated by the person.\n\n(d) Alternatives to certain bonds.--The following shall apply:\n\n(1) An operator of not more than 200 wells who cannot obtain a bond for a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985, as required under subsection (a), due to inability to demonstrate sufficient financial resources may, in lieu of the bond:\n\n(i) Submit to the department a fee in the amount of $50 per well, a blanket fee of $500 for ten to 20 wells or a blanket fee of $1,000 for more than 20 wells, which shall be a nonrefundable fee paid each year that the operator has not filed a bond with the department. All fees collected in lieu of a bond under this subsection shall be used for the purposes authorized by this chapter. The Environmental Quality Board shall have the power, by regulation, to increase the amount of the fees established under this subsection.\n\n(ii) Make phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond, subject to the following:\n\n(A) Payment shall be based on the number of wells owned or operated. The operator shall make an initial deposit and make annual deposits in accordance with the schedule in clause (B). Interest accumulated by the collateral shall become a part of the bond until the collateral plus accumulated interest equals the amount of the required bond. The collateral shall be deposited, in trust, with the State Treasurer as provided in this subsection or with a bank selected by the department which shall act as trustee for the benefit of the Commonwealth to guarantee the operator's compliance with the drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The operator shall be required to pay all costs of the trust.\n\n(B) An operator of up to ten existing wells who does not intend to operate additional wells shall deposit $250 per well and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $50 per well until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 11 to 25 wells or an operator of up to ten wells who applies for one or more permits for additional wells shall deposit $2,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,150 plus $150 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 26 to 50 wells shall deposit $3,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,300 plus $400 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 51 to 100 wells shall deposit $4,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,500 plus $400 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. Operators of 101 to 200 wells shall deposit $8,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,600 plus $1,000 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. Operators of more than 200 wells shall fully bond their wells immediately.\n\n(C) The department shall reduce the amount of phased collateral payments or the period of time over which phased collateral payments shall be made on behalf of owners or operators who, prior to August 1, 1992, have paid a fee in lieu of bond under subparagraph (i), and who, by August 1, 1993, choose to enter the phased collateral program under this subparagraph rather than continue to make payments in lieu of bond. Payments made prior to August 1, 1992, in lieu of bond shall not be credited in any other manner, and the department shall not be required to refund the fees. The Environmental Quality Board, by regulation, may change the annual deposits established under clause (B) if necessary to accommodate a change in the amount of the bond required under this section.\n\n(2) An operator may continue to pay a fee in lieu of bond or make phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond so long as the operator does not miss a payment under this subsection and remains in compliance with this chapter. If an operator misses a payment under this subsection, the operator shall:\n\n(i) immediately submit the appropriate bond amount in full; or\n\n(ii) cease all operations and plug all wells.\n\n(d.1) Individuals.--The following shall apply:\n\n(1) An individual who is unable to obtain a bond to drill new wells due to inability to demonstrate financial resources may meet the collateral bond requirements of subsection (a) by making phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond. The individual shall be limited to drilling ten new wells per calendar year and, for each well to be drilled, deposit $500 and make an annual deposit of 10% of the remaining bond amount for a period of ten years. Interest accumulated shall become a part of the bond until the collateral plus accumulated interest equals the amount of the required bond. The collateral shall be deposited in trust with the State Treasurer under subsection (a) or with a bank selected by the department which shall act as trustee for the benefit of the Commonwealth to guarantee the individual's compliance with the drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The individual shall pay all costs of the trust.\n\n(2) Individuals may continue to use phased collateral to obtain permits if they have not missed a payment for a well drilled under this provision and remain in compliance with this chapter. If an individual misses a payment, the individual shall:\n\n(i) immediately submit the appropriate bond amount in full; or\n\n(ii) cease all operations and plug all wells.\n\n(3) For purposes of this subsection, an \"individual\" means a natural person doing business under his own name.\n\n(e) Reservation of remedies.--All remedies for violations of this chapter, regulations adopted under this chapter and conditions of permits are expressly preserved. Nothing in this section shall be construed as an exclusive penalty or remedy for violations of law. No action taken under this section shall waive or impair any other remedy or penalty provided in law.\n\n(f) Change of law.--Owners or operators who have failed to meet the requirements of this section prior to August 1, 1992, shall not be required to make payments under this section on a retroactive basis as a condition of obtaining a permit under this chapter, nor shall the failure be deemed a violation of this chapter.\n\n(g) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \"well site\" means areas occupied by all equipment or facilities necessary for or incidental to drilling, production or plugging a well.\n\n(July 19, 2022, P.L.1622, No.96, eff. imd.)\n\n2022 Amendment.Act 96 amended subsec.

In the case of wells to be used for gas storage, the annular space between each string of casing and the annular space behind the largest diameter casing to the extent possible shall be filled to the surface with cement or bentonitic mud or a nonporous material approved by the department under section 3221. At least 15 days prior to reconditioning, the storage operator shall give notice to the department, setting forth in the notice the manner in which it is planned to recondition the well and any pertinent data known to the storage operator which will indicate the condition of the well existing at that time. In addition, the storage operator shall give the department at least 72 hours' notice of the time when reconditioning is to begin. If no objections are raised by the department within ten days, the storage operator may proceed with reconditioning in accordance with the plan as submitted. If objections are made by the department, the department may fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251 (relating to conferences) at which the storage operator and department shall endeavor to agree on a plan to satisfy the objections and meet the requirements of this section. If no agreement is reached, the department may, by an appropriate order, determine whether the plan, as submitted, meets the requirements of this section or what changes, if any, are required. If, in reconditioning a well in accordance with the plan, physical conditions are encountered which justify or necessitate a change in the plan, the storage operator may request that the plan be changed. If the request is denied, the department shall fix a conference under section 3251 and proceed in the same manner as with original objections. An application may be made in the manner prescribed by section 3221 for approval of an alternative method of reconditioning a well. If a well located within the storage reservoir was reconditioned, or drilled and equipped, prior to April 18, 1985, the obligations imposed by subsection (a), as to reconditioning the well, shall be considered fully satisfied if, on the basis of the data, information and other evidence submitted to the department, it is determined that:\n\n(i) The conditioning or previous drilling and equipping was done in the manner required in this subsection, in regulations promulgated under this chapter or in a manner approved as an alternative method in accordance with section 3221.\n\n(ii) The reconditioning or previous drilling and equipping is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter.\n\n(2) If a well requires emergency repairs, this chapter shall not be construed to require the storage operator to give any notice required by this subsection before making the repairs.\n\n(d) Exception.--The requirements of subsection (a) shall not apply to injection of gas into a stratum when the sole purpose of injection, referred to in this subsection as testing, is to determine whether the stratum is suitable for storage purposes. Testing shall be conducted only in compliance with the following requirements:\n\n(1) The person testing or proposing to test shall comply with section 3231 (relating to reporting requirements for gas storage operations) and verify the statement required to be filed by that section.\n\n(2) The storage operator shall give at least six months' written notice to the department of the fact that injection of gas for testing purposes is proposed.\n\n(3) If the department has objections, the department shall fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251, not more than ten days from the date of notice to the storage operator, at which time the storage operator and department shall attempt to resolve the issues presented. If an agreement cannot be reached, the department may issue an appropriate order.\n\n(e) Failure to execute lawful order.--In a proceeding under this chapter, if the department determines that an operator of a storage reservoir has failed to carry out a lawful order issued under this chapter, the department may require the operator to suspend operation of the reservoir and withdraw the gas until the violation is remedied, in which case the storage operator, limited by due diligence insofar as existing facilities utilized to remove gas from the reservoir will permit, shall:\n\n(1) if possible, remove the amount required by the department to be removed; or\n\n(2) in any event, remove the maximum amount which can be withdrawn in accordance with recognized engineering and operating procedures.\n\n(f) Duty of storage reservoir operator.--The following shall apply:\n\n(1) A person owning or operating a storage reservoir subject to this chapter shall have a duty to:\n\n(i) Maintain all wells drilled into or through the reservoir in a condition and operate them in a manner sufficient to prevent the escape of gas.\n\n(ii) Operate and maintain the reservoir and its facilities as prescribed by departmental regulations and at a pressure which will prevent gas from escaping, but the pressure shall not exceed the highest rock pressure found to have existed during the production history of the reservoir or another high pressure limit approved by the department after holding a conference under section 3251 based on geological and production knowledge of the reservoir, its character, permeability distribution and operating experience.\n\n(2) The duty under paragraph (1) shall not be construed to include inability to prevent the escape of gas when gas escapes as a result of an act of God or a person not under the control of the storage operator. In that instance, the storage operator shall have a duty to take action reasonably necessary to prevent the further escape of gas. This paragraph does not apply to a well which the storage operator failed to locate and make known to the department.",

      "text": "(a) General rule.--A person operating a storage reservoir which underlies or is within 2,000 linear feet of a coal mine operating in a coal seam that extends over the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area shall:\n\n(1) Use every known reasonable method for discovering and locating all wells which have or may have been drilled into or through the storage stratum in the acreage lying within the outside coal boundaries of the operating coal mine overlying the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area.\n\n(2) Plug or recondition, as provided by section 3220 (relating to plugging requirements) and subsection (e), all known wells, except to the extent provided in subsections (e), (f), (g) and (h), drilled into or through the storage stratum and located within the portion of the acreage of the operating coal mine overlying the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area. If an objection is raised as to use of a well as a storage well and, after a conference under section 3251 (relating to conferences), it is determined by the department, taking into account all circumstances and conditions, that the well should not be used as a storage well, the well shall be plugged unless, in the opinion of the storage operator, the well may be used as a storage well in the future, in which case, upon approval of the department after taking into account all circumstances and conditions, the storage operator may recondition and inactivate the well rather than plug it.\n\n(3) The requirements of paragraph (2) shall be deemed to have been fully complied with if, as the operating coal mine is extended, all wells which from time to time come within the acreage described in paragraph (2) are reconditioned or plugged as provided in section 3220 and subsection (e) or (f) so that, by the time the coal mine has reached a point within 2,000 linear feet of the wells, they will have been reconditioned or plugged in accordance with section 3220 and subsection (e) or (f).\n\n(b) Verified statement.--A person operating a storage reservoir referred to in subsection (a) shall file with the department and furnish a copy to the person operating the affected operating coal mine a verified statement setting forth:\n\n(1) That the map and any supplemental maps required by section 3231(a) (relating to reporting requirements for gas storage operations) have been prepared and filed in accordance with section 3231.\n\n(2) A detailed explanation of what the storage operator has done to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) and (2) and the results of those actions.\n\n(3) Such additional efforts, if any, as the storage operator is making and intends to make to locate all wells.\n\n(4) Any additional wells that are to be plugged or reconditioned to meet the requirements of subsection (a)(2).\n\n(b.1) Order of department.--If the statement required under subsection (b) is not filed by the storage reservoir operator within the time specified by this chapter or the regulations of the department, the department may order the operator to file the statement.\n\n(c) Procedure.--Within 120 days after receipt of a statement required by this section, the department may direct that a conference be held in accordance with section 3251 to determine whether the requirements of section 3231 and subsection (a) have been fully met. At the conference, if any person believes the requirements have not been fully met, the parties shall attempt to agree on additional actions to be taken and the time for completion, subject to approval of the department. If an agreement cannot be reached, the department shall make a determination and, if the department determines any requirements have not been met, the department shall issue an order specifying in detail the extent to which the requirements have not been met and the actions which the storage operator must complete to meet the requirements. The order shall grant as much time as is reasonably necessary to fully comply. If the storage operator encounters conditions not known to exist at the time of issuance of the order and which materially affect the validity of the order or the ability of the storage operator to comply with it, the storage operator may apply for a rehearing or modification of the order.\n\n(d) Notification.--If, in complying with subsection (a), a storage operator, after filing the statement provided for in subsection (b), plugs or reconditions a well, the storage operator shall notify the department and the coal operator affected, in writing, setting forth facts indicating the manner in which the plugging or reconditioning was done. Upon receipt of the notification, the coal operator or department may request a conference under section 3251.\n\n(e) Plugging wells.--In order to meet the requirements of subsection (a), wells which are to be plugged shall be plugged in the manner specified in regulations promulgated under section 3211 (relating to well permits). When a well located within the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area has been plugged prior to April 18, 1985, and, on the basis of the data information and other evidence submitted to the department, it is determined that the plugging was done in the manner required by section 3220, or in a manner approved as an alternative method in accordance with section 3221 (relating to alternative methods), and the plugging is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter, the requirements of subsection (a) as to plugging the well shall be considered to have been fully satisfied.\n\n(f) Reconditioned wells.--The following shall apply:\n\n(1) In order to comply with subsection (a), unless the department by regulation specifies a different procedure, wells which are to be reconditioned shall be cleaned out from the surface through the storage horizon, and the following casing strings shall be pulled and replaced with new casing, using the procedure applicable to drilling a new well under this chapter:\n\n(i) the producing casing;\n\n(ii) the largest diameter casing passing through the lowest workable coal seam unless it extends at least 25 feet below the bottom of the coal seam and is determined to be in good physical condition, but the storage operator may, instead of replacing the largest diameter casing, replace the next largest casing string if the casing string extends at least 25 feet below the lowest workable coal seam; and\n\n(iii) casing strings determined not to be in good physical condition.\n\n(2) In the case of a well to be used for gas storage, the annular space between each string of casing and the annular space behind the largest diameter casing, to the extent possible, shall be filled to the surface with cement or bentonitic mud or an equally nonporous material approved by the department under section 3221.\n\n(3) At least 15 days before a well is to be reconditioned, the storage operator shall give notice to the department and the coal operator, lessee or owner, setting forth the manner in which reconditioning is planned and pertinent data known to the storage operator which will indicate the current condition of the well, along with at least 72 hours' notice of the date and time when reconditioning will begin. The coal operator, lessee or owner shall have the right to file, within ten days after receipt of the notice, objections to the plan of reconditioning as submitted by the storage operator. If no objections are filed and none are raised by the department within ten days, the storage operator may proceed with reconditioning in accordance with the plan as submitted. If an objection is filed or made by the department, the department shall fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251, at which conference the storage operator and the person having objections shall attempt to agree on a plan of reconditioning that meets the requirements of this section. If no agreement is reached, the department shall, by an appropriate order, determine whether the plan as submitted meets the requirements of this section or what changes should be made to meet the requirements. If, in reconditioning the well in accordance with the plan, physical conditions are encountered which justify or necessitate a change in the plan, the storage operator or coal operator may request that the plan be changed. If the parties cannot agree on a change, the department shall arrange for a conference to determine the matter in the same manner as set forth in connection with original objections to the plan.\n\n(4) Application may be made to the department in the manner prescribed in section 3221 for approval of an alternative method of reconditioning a well. When a well located within the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area has been reconditioned or drilled and equipped prior to April 18, 1985, and, on the basis of the data, information and other evidence submitted to the department, the obligations imposed by subsection (a) as to reconditioning the well shall be considered to be fully satisfied if it is determined that reconditioning or previous drilling and equipping:\n\n(i) was done in the manner required in this subsection, or in regulations promulgated hereunder, or in a manner approved as an alternative method in accordance with section 3221; or\n\n(ii) is still sufficiently effective to meet the requirements of this chapter.\n\n(5) If a well requires emergency repairs, this subsection shall not be construed to require the storage operator to give the notices specified herein before making the repairs.\n\n(g) Producing wells.--If a well located within the reservoir protective area is a producing well in a stratum below the storage stratum, the obligations imposed by subsection (a) shall not begin until the well ceases to be a producing well.\n\n(h) Certain other wells.--If a well within a storage reservoir or reservoir protective area penetrates the storage stratum but does not penetrate the coal seam being mined by an operating coal mine, the department may, upon application of the operator of the storage reservoir, exempt the well from the requirements of this section. Either party affected may request a conference under section 3251 with respect to exemption of a well covered by this subsection.\n\n(i) Plugging limitation.--In fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a)(2) with respect to a well within the reservoir protective area, the storage operator shall not be required to plug or recondition the well until the storage operator has received from the coal operator written notice that the mine workings will, within the period stated in the notice, be within 2,000 linear feet of the well. Upon the receipt of the notice, the storage operator shall use due diligence to complete the plugging or reconditioning of the well in accordance with the requirements of this section and section 3220. If the mine workings do not, within a period of three years after the well has been plugged, come within 2,000 linear feet of the well, the coal operator shall reimburse the storage operator for the cost of plugging, provided that the well is still within the reservoir protective area as of that time.\n\n(j) Retreat mining.--If retreat mining approaches a point where, within 90 days, it is expected that the retreat work will be at the location of the pillar surrounding an active storage well, the coal operator shall give written notice to the storage operator, and by agreement, the parties shall determine whether it is necessary or advisable to effectively and temporarily inactivate the well. The well shall not be reactivated until a reasonable period, determined by the parties, has elapsed. If the parties cannot agree as required by this subsection, the matter shall be submitted to the department for resolution. The number of wells required to be temporarily inactivated during the retreat period shall not be of a number that materially affects efficient operation of the storage pool, except that this provision shall not preclude temporary inactivation of a particular well if the practical effect of inactivating it is to render the pool temporarily inoperative.\n\n(k) Exceptions.--The requirements of subsections (a), (l) and (m) shall not apply to injection of gas into a stratum when the whole purpose of injection, referred to in this subsection as testing, is to determine whether the stratum is suitable for storage purposes. Testing shall be conducted only in compliance with the following requirements:\n\n(1) The person testing or proposing to test shall comply with all provisions and requirements of section 3231 and verify the statement required to be filed by that section.\n\n(2) If any part of the proposed storage reservoir is under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine which is operating in a coal seam that extends over the proposed storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area, the storage operator shall give at least six months' written notice to the department and coal operator of the fact that injection of gas for testing purposes is proposed.\n\n(3) The coal operator affected may at any time file objections with the department, whereupon the department shall fix a time and place for a conference under section 3251, not more than ten days from the date of the notice to the storage operator. At the conference, the storage operator and the objecting party shall attempt to agree, subject to approval of the department, on the questions involved. If an agreement cannot be reached, the department may issue an appropriate order.\n\n(4) If at any time a proposed storage reservoir being tested comes under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine because of extension of the storage reservoir being tested or because of extension or establishment or reestablishment of the operating coal mine, the requirements of this subsection shall immediately become applicable to the testing.\n\n(l) Storage reservoirs near operating coal mines.--A person who proposes to establish a storage reservoir under or within 2,000 linear feet of a coal mine operating in a coal seam that extends over the storage reservoir or the reservoir protective area shall, prior to establishing the reservoir, and in addition to complying with section 3231 and subsection (a), file the verified statement required by subsection (b) and fully comply with any order of the department in the manner provided under subsection (b) or (c) before commencing operation of the storage reservoir. After the person proposing to operate the storage reservoir complies with the requirements of this subsection and commences operations, the person shall continue to be subject to all provisions of this chapter.\n\n(m) Gas storage reservoirs.--If a gas storage reservoir is in operation on April 18, 1985, and at any time thereafter it is under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine, or if a gas storage reservoir is put in operation after April 18, 1985, and at any time after storage operations begin it is under or within 2,000 linear feet of an operating coal mine, the storage operator shall comply with all of the provisions of this section, except that:\n\n(1) the time for filing the verified statement under subsection (b) shall be 60 days after the date stated in the notice filed by the coal operator under section 3232(d) and (e) (relating to reporting requirements for coal mining operations);\n\n(2) the coal operator shall give notice of the delay to the department;\n\n(3) the department shall, upon the request of the storage operator, extend the time for filing the statement by the additional time which will be required to extend or establish or reestablish the operating coal mine to a point within 2,000 linear feet of the reservoir;\n\n(4) the verified statement shall also indicate that the map referred to in section 3231(a) has been currently amended as of the time of the filing of the statement; and\n\n(5) the person operating the storage reservoir shall continue to be subject to all of the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(n) Failure to comply with order.--If, in any proceeding under this chapter, the department determines that an operator of a storage reservoir has failed to comply with a lawful order issued under this chapter, the department may require the storage operator to suspend operation of the reservoir and withdraw the gas from it until the violation is remedied, in which case the storage operator, limited by due diligence insofar as existing facilities utilized to remove gas from the reservoir will permit, shall:\n\n(1) if possible, remove the amount required by the department to be removed; or\n\n(2) in any event, remove the maximum amount which can be withdrawn in accordance with recognized engineering and operating procedures.\n\n(o) Prevention of escape of gas.--In addition to initial compliance with other provisions of this chapter and lawful orders issued under this chapter, it shall be the duty, at all times, of a person owning or operating a storage reservoir subject to this chapter to keep all wells drilled into or through the storage stratum in a condition, and operate the wells in a manner, which is designed to prevent the escape of gas out of the storage reservoir and its facilities, and to operate and maintain the storage reservoir and its facilities in the manner prescribed by regulation of the department and at a pressure that will prevent gas from escaping from the reservoir or its facilities. This duty shall not be construed to include inability to prevent the escape of gas when escape results from an act of God or a person not under the control of the storage operator, except that this exception does not apply to a well which the storage operator has failed to locate and make known to the department. If an escape of gas results from an act of God or a person not under the control of the storage operator, the storage operator shall be under the duty to take any action reasonably necessary to prevent the further escape of gas out of the storage reservoir and its facilities.",
