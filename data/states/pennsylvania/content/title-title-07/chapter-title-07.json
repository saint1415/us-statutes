The tax shall be increased by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective January 1, 1985, and by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective July 1, 1985. Distributors shall be liable to the Commonwealth for the collection and payment of the tax imposed by this section. The tax shall be collected by the distributor and shall be paid to the Commonwealth only once with respect to any fuels. (b) Annual adjustment.-- Beginning on January 1, 1986, and each January 1 thereafter, the tax imposed under this section shall be adjusted annually and shall be set for that calendar year. The adjustment shall be based upon the percentage change of the Producer Price Index for Jet Fuel, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States Department of Labor, for the most recent 12-month period available as of the immediately preceding November 1. For every 10% increase or decrease in the Producer Price Index, as determined by comparing the index for the first month of the 12-month period with the index for the last month of the period, there shall be a 0.1¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, increase or decrease in the rate of tax. The rate of tax shall be determined by the Secretary of Revenue, who shall cause such rate to be published as a notice pursuant to 45 Pa.C.S. § 725(a)(3) (relating to additional contents of Pennsylvania Bulletin) in the Pennsylvania Bulletin on or before December 15 of each year. The tax, as adjusted, shall never exceed 2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, nor shall it be less than 1.5¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof. (c) Construction of section.-- This section shall be construed in conjunction with the act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, as if jet fuels were liquid fuels as defined in that act, and all of the provisions of that act, except for section 4 thereof to the extent it imposes any tax, shall apply to the collection, administration and enforcement of the tax imposed under this section. Upon the effective date of the tax imposed by this section upon jet fuels, such jet fuels shall not be subject to the tax imposed by the act of January 14, 1952 (1951 P.L.1965, No.550), known as the Fuel Use Tax Act, except that dealer-users shall remain liable to report and pay the fuel use tax on any jet fuels used thereafter upon which the tax provided by this section has not been imposed. (d) Disposition of taxes.-- All moneys collected under this section shall be deposited by the State Treasurer in the Aviation Restricted Account. Effective Date of Tax. Section 4 of Act 164 of 1984 provided that, if Act 164 was not finally enacted on or before July 1, 1984, the tax imposed under section 6131 shall not be effective as of July 1, 1984, but shall be effective on the first day of the first month following final enactment (November 1, 1984). References in Text. The act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, referred to in subsec. (c), was repealed by the act of April 17, 1997 (P.L.6, No.3).

(ii) It does not appear that the interests of the Commonwealth will be injured by the offender's parole. (2) Parole shall be subject in every instance to the Commonwealth's right to immediately retake and hold in custody without further proceedings any offender charged after his parole with an additional offense until a determination can be made whether to continue his parole status.

(3.1) (i) Following the expiration of the offender's minimum term of imprisonment, if the primary reason for not paroling the offender is the offender's inability to access and complete prescribed programming within the correctional institution, the board may release the offender on parole with the condition that the offender complete the prescribed programming while on parole. (ii) This paragraph shall not apply to offenders who are currently serving a term of imprisonment for a crime of violence as defined in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714 (relating to sentences for second and subsequent offenses) or for a crime requiring registration under 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 97 Subch. H (relating to registration of sexual offenders). (iii) For those offenders to whom subparagraph (ii) is applicable, the board may release the offender on parole if the offender is subject to another jurisdiction's detainer, warrant or equivalent writ. (4) Unless the offender has served at least one year in a community corrections center or community corrections facility, the board shall not act upon an application of an offender who is granted clemency by the Governor, is subject to parole supervision and: (i) whose term of imprisonment was commuted from life to life on parole; (ii) who was serving a term of imprisonment for a crime of violence; or (iii) who is serving a sentence under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712 (relating to sentences for offenses committed with firearms). (5) Upon parole, an offender subject to paragraph (4) shall: (i) be subject to weekly supervision for the first six months of parole; and (ii) have any violations of a condition of parole immediately made known to the Board of Pardons. This subparagraph shall apply to all offenders under supervision by other jurisdictions under Subchapter B of Chapter 71 (relating to interstate compact for the supervision of adult offenders). (b) Cases involving deviations from guidelines.-- In each case in which the board deviates from the guidelines established under 42 Pa.C.S. § 2154.5, the board shall provide a contemporaneous written statement of the reason for the deviation from the guidelines to the commission as established under 42 Pa.C.S. § 2153(a)(14) (relating to powers and duties). The board may develop and use internal decisional instruments. This subsection shall not be construed to prevent the board from also developing forms or other documents, policies and procedures consistent with this chapter, including internal decisional instruments. (c) Administrative parole.-- (Deleted by amendment).

(i) (Deleted by amendment). (ii) (Deleted by amendment). (iii) (Deleted by amendment). (4) For an offender who was not paroled from a sentence arising from a conviction under The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act or from a drug-related crime, the board may establish, as a condition of supervision, that the offender achieve negative results in drug screening tests randomly conducted. The offender shall be responsible for testing costs. (f) Crimes of violence.-- The board may not order the release of an offender on parole who is sentenced after February 19, 1999, and is serving a sentence for a crime of violence unless the offender has received instruction from the department on the impact of crime on victims and the community. (g) Procedures for Recidivism Risk Reduction Incentive.-- (1) The department shall identify all offenders committed to the custody of the department that meet the definition of an eligible offender. (2) Upon identification of an inmate as an eligible offender, as defined under section 4503 (relating to definitions), the department shall send notice to the board. The board shall send notice to the prosecuting attorney and the court no less than six months before the expiration of the offender's minimum sentence indicating that the department has preliminarily identified the offender as an eligible offender. The notice shall be sent by United States mail unless the board, the court and the prosecutor have consented to receipt of notice via electronic means. For offenders committed to the department whose expiration of the minimum sentence is six months or less from the date of admission, the department shall give prompt notice. (2.1) The department shall provide the board all information related to the offender's adjustment while incarcerated, misconducts, if any, information related to programming and treatment, including success, completion or failure to complete, or any other information the department deems relevant. The board shall send such information to the prosecuting attorney and to the court no less than six months before the expiration of the offender's minimum sentence. The notice may be sent electronically. For offenders committed to the department whose expiration of the minimum sentence is six months or less from the date of admission, such information shall be sent at the same time prompt notice under paragraph (2) is given. (3) Within 30 days of receipt of notice under paragraph (2), the court or prosecuting attorney may file with the board a written objection to the department's preliminary identification of the offender as an eligible offender. Notice of the objection shall be provided to the department and the board. (4) If no notice of objection has been filed under paragraph (3), the eligible offender shall be paroled at the minimum date upon a determination by the board or the board's designee that all of the following apply: (i) The department certified that the offender has maintained a good conduct record and continues to remain an eligible offender under section 4503. (ii) The reentry plan for the offender is adequate. (iii) Individual conditions and requirements for parole have been established for the offender. (iv) There is no reasonable indication that the offender poses a risk to public safety. (5) If the court or prosecuting attorney files a timely objection under paragraph (3), the board shall make a determination as to whether the offender is an eligible offender. The board shall notify the department, prosecuting attorney and court of its determination no later than 30 days prior to the minimum parole date. If the board determines that the offender is an eligible offender under this chapter, the board shall follow the provisions under paragraph (4). If the board determines that the offender is not an eligible offender under section 4503 (relating to definitions), the board shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to grant parole and shall determine whether the offender should be paroled at the minimum date, paroled at a later date or denied parole. (6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as granting a right to be paroled to any person, and any decision by the board and its designees or the department, under this section shall not be considered an adjudication under 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 Subch. A (relating to practice and procedure of Commonwealth agencies) and Ch. 7 Subch. A (relating to judicial review of Commonwealth agency action). (7) Except as provided under this subsection, nothing in this chapter shall otherwise affect the powers and duties of the board or the department. (h) Power to recommit.-- (1) The board may, during the period for which an offender shall have been sentenced, recommit the offender, if paroled, for violation of the terms and conditions of his parole and from time to time to reparole and recommit in the same manner and with the same procedure as in the case of an original parol or recommitment if, in the judgment of the board: (i) There is a reasonable probability that the offender will be benefited by paroling the offender again. (ii) It does not appear that the interests of the Commonwealth will be injured by paroling the offender again. (2) In exercising these powers, the board shall consider any applicable recommitment ranges established by the commission under 42 Pa.C.S. § 2154.6 (relating to adoption of recommitment ranges following revocation of parole by board). (i) Cases involving deviations from guidelines.-- In each case in which the board deviates from the recommitment ranges established under 42 Pa.C.S. § 2154.6, the board shall provide a contemporaneous written statement of the reason for the deviation from the recommitment ranges to the commission, as established under 42 Pa.C.S. § 2153(a)(14). (j) Notice to county probation department.-- When the board releases an offender from a correctional facility, the board shall provide written notice to the probation department located in the county where the sentencing order was imposed of the release and new address of the offender.

(a) Convicted violators.-- (1) The board may, at its discretion, revoke the parole of a paroled offender if the offender, during the period of parole or while delinquent on parole, commits a crime punishable by imprisonment, for which the offender is convicted or found guilty by a judge or jury or to which the offender pleads guilty or nolo contendere at any time thereafter in a court of record. (1.1) In addition to paragraph (1), a parolee under the jurisdiction of the board released from a correctional facility who, during the period of parole or while delinquent on parole, commits a crime punishable by imprisonment for which the parolee is convicted or found guilty by a judge or jury or to which the parolee pleads guilty or nolo contendere or of any misdemeanor of the third degree or of any of the following offenses where graded as a summary offense, may at the discretion of the board be recommitted as a parole violator: (i) Possession of a firearm in a court facility under 18 Pa.C.S. § 913(b)(3) (relating to possession of firearm or other dangerous weapon in court facility).

(ii) If a person is paroled from a county prison and the new sentence imposed upon him is to be served in the same county prison. (iii) In all other cases, the service of the new term for the latter crime shall precede commencement of the balance of the term originally imposed. (5.1) If the offender is sentenced to serve a new term of total confinement by a Federal court or by a court of another jurisdiction because of a verdict or plea under paragraph (1), the offender shall serve the balance of the original term before serving the new term.

(b) Subsequent arrest.-- (1) The formal filing of a charge after parole against an offender within this Commonwealth for any violation of the laws of this Commonwealth shall constitute an automatic detainer and permit the offender to be taken into and held in custody.

(3) The automatic detainer shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other detainer that prior to the effective date of this chapter may have been lodged in such circumstances. (c) Technical violators.-- (1) Subject to paragraph (1.3), an offender under the jurisdiction of the board who violates the terms and conditions of his parole, other than a convicted violator who has parole revoked under subsection (a), may be detained pending a hearing before the board or waiver of the hearing or recommitted after a hearing before the board or a waiver of the hearing.

The program shall provide for immediate detention in a community corrections center, community corrections facility or any secured facility operated or contracted by the department for a period not to exceed seven days. The board shall adopt procedures governing appropriate detention under this paragraph, including identifying which offenders are eligible for the program and providing warnings to offenders to clearly communicate expectations and consequences. (1.3) If the board determines that one of the following conditions is present regarding an offender who violates the terms and conditions of parole, the offender shall not be eligible for detention under paragraph (1.2) and shall be detained in or recommitted to a State correctional institution or contracted county jail: (i) The violation was sexual in nature. (ii) The violation involved assaultive behavior or included a credible threat to cause bodily injury to another. (iii) The violation involved possession or control of a weapon.

(2) If the offender is recommitted under this subsection, the offender shall be given credit for the time served on parole in good standing but with no credit for delinquent time and may be reentered to serve the remainder of the original sentence or sentences. Credit awarded to a technical parole violator for time served on parole in good standing is subject to forfeiture if the offender is subsequently recommitted as a convicted parole violator. (3) The remainder shall be computed by the board from the time the offender's delinquent conduct occurred for the unexpired period of the maximum sentence imposed by the court without credit for the period the offender was delinquent on parole. The offender shall serve the remainder so computed from the date the offender is taken into custody by the department's agent. (4) Subject to subsection (e), the offender shall be subject to reparole by the board whenever in its opinion the best interests of the offender justify or require the offender being reparoled and it does not appear that the interests of the Commonwealth will be injured reparoling the offender. (5) Parole violators shall be supervised in accordance with evidence-based practices that may include: (i) Consideration of whether the offender poses a risk of safety to the community or himself.

Detention and recommitment under this paragraph shall be to the county correctional facility from which the offender was released. (d) Recommitment to correctional facility.-- A technical parole violator recommitted to a State correctional institution or a contracted county jail under subsection (c) shall be recommitted as follows: (1) If paroled from a county prison, to the same institution or to any other institution to which the offender may be legally transferred.

(5) If the court or prosecuting attorney files a timely objection under paragraph (3), the board shall make a determination as to whether the offender is an eligible offender. The board shall notify the department, prosecuting attorney and court of its determination no later than 30 days prior to the minimum parole date. If the board determines that the offender is an eligible offender under this chapter, the board shall follow the provisions under paragraph (4). If the board determines that the offender is not an eligible offender under section 4503 (relating to definitions), the board shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to grant parole and shall determine whether the offender should be paroled at the minimum date, paroled at a later date or denied parole. (6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as granting a right to be paroled to any person, and any decision by the board and its designees or the department, under this section shall not be considered an adjudication under 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 Subch. A (relating to practice and procedure of Commonwealth agencies) and Ch. 7 Subch. A (relating to judicial review of Commonwealth agency action).

(ii) It does not appear that the interests of the Commonwealth will be injured by paroling the offender again. (2) In exercising these powers, the board shall consider any applicable recommitment ranges established by the commission under 42 Pa.C.S. § 2154.6 (relating to adoption of recommitment ranges following revocation of parole by board). (i) Cases involving deviations from guidelines.-- In each case in which the board deviates from the recommitment ranges established under 42 Pa.C.S. § 2154.6, the board shall provide a contemporaneous written statement of the reason for the deviation from the recommitment ranges to the commission, as established under 42 Pa.C.S. § 2153(a)(14).
