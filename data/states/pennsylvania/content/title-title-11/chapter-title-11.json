(2) A street may not remain closed for a longer period than is necessary for the purpose for which the order to close was issued. (3) Except in cases of emergency, when immediate action is necessary to protect public safety, no street shall be closed to vehicular traffic when the street has been designated as a detour by the Department of Transportation, unless the Secretary of Transportation has provided written consent or council has, by resolution duly recorded on its minutes, declared the closing necessary for the safety of the public. (4) When any street which forms a part or section of a State highway or has been designated as a detour by the Department of Transportation is closed to vehicular traffic, the city shall at once notify the Department of Transportation of the creation of a detour under this section. The Department of Transportation shall be notified immediately after the detour is removed. (5) When any street is to be closed, it shall be the duty of the official or department that authorized the closing to designate a detour. (6) While the detour is in use, legible signs shall be erected and maintained at reasonable intervals, indicating the proper direction and the detour shall be maintained in safe and passable condition. (7) When the street that had been closed is opened for traffic, all detour signs shall be removed. (b) Agreements with owners of private land.-- A city may enter into an agreement with the owners of private lands covering the acquisition of right-of-way privileges for a detour over private property for the period when a street shall be closed to traffic. If the parties cannot reach an agreement, the city may proceed with the construction of the detour, with the owner of the property taken for the detour entitled to seek damages, if any, in the same manner as damages are now ascertained for the opening of streets in the city. (c) Payment.-- In the exercise of the rights conferred by this section relating to detours, council is empowered to pay for the necessary maintenance, subsequent repair and land rental out of money available for the construction and maintenance of city streets. (d) Penalty.-- Any individual who willfully removes, defaces, destroys or disregards any barricade, light, danger sign, detour sign, signal or warning of any other type legally erected or placed or who drives on, over or across any street which has been closed by proper authority commits a summary offense punishable upon conviction in accordance with section 11018.16 (relating to enforcement of ordinances, recovery and payment of fines and penalties). (e) Fine for multiple offenses.-- In addition to subsection (d), a person shall pay a fine of not less than $500 or more than the maximum fine authorized in section 11018.17 (relating to penalty) for the second or any subsequent offense. (f) Costs of prosecution.-- An individual punished under subsection (d) or (e) shall pay the costs of prosecution together with the value of the property so removed, defaced or destroyed. (g) Exception.-- An individual who has no outlet due to the closing of a street may drive on, over or across the street, subject to reasonable conditions as may be prescribed by the city without being subject to the penalties imposed by this section. (h) Collection of fines.-- All fines collected under the provisions of this section shall be paid over to the city treasurer. (i) Civil damages.-- In addition to the penalties provided in subsections (d) and (e), the city, its agents or contractors may, in an action at law, recover damages from any person who damages a street when it is closed to vehicular traffic.",

(a) Payments.-- The following apply: (1) Payments of pensions shall only be a charge on the firefighters pension fund and shall not be a charge on any other fund under the control, or in the treasury, of the city. (2) The basis of the pension of a member shall be determined by the monthly salary of the member at the date of vesting under section 14320.1 (relating to limited vested benefit for firefighters) or retirement or the highest average annual salary which the member received during any five years of service preceding retirement, whichever is higher, whether for disability or by reason of age or service, and, except as to service increments provided for in subsection (b), shall be one-half the annual salary of the member at the time of vesting under section 14320.1 or retirement computed at the monthly or average annual rate, whichever is higher. (3) For payment of pensions to members for permanent injury incurred in service and to families of members killed or who die in service, the amount and commencement of the payment of pensions shall be fixed by regulations of the board of managers. These regulations shall not take into consideration the amount and duration of workers' compensation allowed by law. Payments to surviving spouses of members retired on pension or killed in service on or after January 1, 1960, or who die in service on or after January 1, 1968, shall be the amount payable to the member or which would have been payable had the member been retired at the time of the member's death. (a.1) Home rule and optional charter plans.-- The provisions of subsection (a)(2) shall not apply to a city, whether operating under an optional charter adopted in accordance with the act of July 15, 1957 (P.L.901, No.399), known as the Optional Third Class City Charter Law, or under a home rule charter adopted in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S. Pt. III Subpt. E (relating to home rule and optional plan government), which had pension plans in effect prior to June 19, 2002, that provided pensions in an amount greater than 50% of salary. (b) Service increment.-- In addition to the pension which is authorized to be paid from the firefighters pension fund under this chapter and notwithstanding the limitations placed upon the pensions and upon contributions under this chapter, every contributor entitled to the pension shall also be entitled to the payment of a service increment in accordance with and subject to the conditions imposed under this chapter. (1) A service increment shall be the sum obtained by computing the number of whole years after having served the minimum required by this chapter during which a contributor has been employed by the city and paid out of the city treasury, including credit for military service as provided in section 14321 (relating to retirement and final discharge), and multiplying the number of years by an amount equal to 0.025% of the retirement allowance which has become payable to the contributor in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In computing the service increment, no employment after the contributor has reached 65 years of age shall be included and no service increment shall be paid in excess of $100 per month. (2) After September 18, 1968, each contributor shall pay into the pension fund a monthly sum in addition to the contributor's pension contribution which shall not exceed the sum of $1 per month, provided that the service increment contribution shall not be paid after a contributor has reached 65 years of age. (3) Any individual who is a member of the department on September 18, 1968, and who has reached 65 years of age shall have the individual's service increment computed on the years of employment prior to the member reaching 65 years of age. (4) Service increment contributions shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as pensions and may be withdrawn in full, without interest, by individuals who leave the employment of the city, subject to the same conditions by which retirement contributions may be withdrawn, or by individuals who retire before becoming entitled to any service increment. (5) All members of the fire department who are now contributors to the pension fund and all those employed by the city after September 18, 1968, if required to become contributors to the pension fund, shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. (6) After June 19, 2002, a city may agree to make service increment payments in excess of $100 per month as long as the payments do not exceed $500 per month, and, in computing the service increments, no employment after the contributor has reached 65 years of age shall be included, provided that any agreement to provide an increase in service increment payments shall include a proportionate increase in the amount each contributor shall pay into the retirement fund under paragraph (2), not to exceed $5 per month.",

(4) If both written and oral examination methods are used in conjunction with each other, the board, prior to initiating testing, shall establish what constitutes a passing score on each portion of the examination. If only a written examination method is used, the board shall establish the passing score before the examination is conducted. (5) When more than one individual takes examinations for any position at the same time, the names of all those successfully passing the examination shall be entered on the eligibility list in the order of their respective point totals, the highest coming first. (6) The board shall furnish to council a certified copy of all lists prepared and kept. Lists are public records and shall be maintained for a period of two years or until a new list is certified to council, whichever occurs first.

(a) Request.-- Upon request of the board of school directors of the school district in which a city is located, council may appoint school crossing guards who shall control and direct traffic at or near schools.

The compensation of the school crossing guards, if any, shall be fixed by council and shall be jointly paid by council and the board of school directors, in a ratio to be determined by council and the board of school directors. If council and the board of school directors are unable to determine the ratio of compensation of the school crossing guards to be paid by council and the board, each shall pay one-half of the compensation of the school crossing guards. (b) Ordinance.-- (1) Council may enact an ordinance allowing a board of school directors to assume the hiring and oversight of the school crossing guards. Before council may enact the ordinance, the board of directors of the school district shall adopt a resolution requesting the authority to assume the hiring and oversight of the school crossing guards. The ordinance enacted by council shall outline how the city police department will provide any necessary training and assistance to the school crossing guards while on duty. (2) School crossing guards shall not fall under the bargaining unit of the school district or be classified as an employee or under any benefits as provided under the act of March 10, 1949 (P.L.30, No.14), known as the Public School Code of 1949.

(3) After the ordinance is enacted by council, the school district shall assume the cost of compensation, including fixing the compensation, if any, of the school crossing guards. The board of school directors shall notify council, the mayor and the police chief or commissioner of those hired to serve as school crossing guards and request the necessary training or assistance be provided as outlined by the ordinance. (c) Duties.-- Whether council appoints school crossing guards upon the request of the board of school directors or whether council enacts an ordinance allowing a board of school directors to assume the hiring and oversight of the school crossing guards, the following shall apply to school crossing guards: (1) Their duties and authority shall be restricted to the management of traffic and pedestrians in and around areas identified by the city police force and the school district superintendent or a designee.

(ii) The respective rates levied on land and buildings do not have to be equal but must be fixed so as not to constitute a greater levy in the aggregate than a rate of 30 mills on both land and buildings. (iii) The rates shall be uniform as to all real estate within the classification. (4) Where council, by a majority action upon due cause shown, petitions the court of common pleas for the right to levy additional millage for general revenue purposes, the court, after public notice as it may direct and after hearing, may order a greater rate than 30 mills but not more than five additional mills to be levied. (5) (i) Notwithstanding council's power to authorize the transfer of an unexpended balance of an appropriation item pursuant to section 11804 (relating to regulations concerning appropriation), when money is collected for any special purpose, a city treasurer or council member may not apply the money for any purpose other than that for which it was collected. (ii) Any city treasurer or council member who violates subparagraph (i) commits a misdemeanor of the third degree and, in addition to the fine or penalty that may be imposed upon conviction, shall be required to pay restitution in the amount of money improperly spent.

(2) A street may not remain closed for a longer period than is necessary for the purpose for which the order to close was issued. (3) Except in cases of emergency, when immediate action is necessary to protect public safety, no street shall be closed to vehicular traffic when the street has been designated as a detour by the Department of Transportation, unless the Secretary of Transportation has provided written consent or council has, by resolution duly recorded on its minutes, declared the closing necessary for the safety of the public. (4) When any street which forms a part or section of a State highway or has been designated as a detour by the Department of Transportation is closed to vehicular traffic, the city shall at once notify the Department of Transportation of the creation of a detour under this section. The Department of Transportation shall be notified immediately after the detour is removed. (5) When any street is to be closed, it shall be the duty of the official or department that authorized the closing to designate a detour. (6) While the detour is in use, legible signs shall be erected and maintained at reasonable intervals, indicating the proper direction and the detour shall be maintained in safe and passable condition. (7) When the street that had been closed is opened for traffic, all detour signs shall be removed. (b) Agreements with owners of private land.-- A city may enter into an agreement with the owners of private lands covering the acquisition of right-of-way privileges for a detour over private property for the period when a street shall be closed to traffic. If the parties cannot reach an agreement, the city may proceed with the construction of the detour, with the owner of the property taken for the detour entitled to seek damages, if any, in the same manner as damages are now ascertained for the opening of streets in the city. (c) Payment.-- In the exercise of the rights conferred by this section relating to detours, council is empowered to pay for the necessary maintenance, subsequent repair and land rental out of money available for the construction and maintenance of city streets. (d) Penalty.-- Any individual who willfully removes, defaces, destroys or disregards any barricade, light, danger sign, detour sign, signal or warning of any other type legally erected or placed or who drives on, over or across any street which has been closed by proper authority commits a summary offense punishable upon conviction in accordance with section 11018.16 (relating to enforcement of ordinances, recovery and payment of fines and penalties). (e) Fine for multiple offenses.-- In addition to subsection (d), a person shall pay a fine of not less than $500 or more than the maximum fine authorized in section 11018.17 (relating to penalty) for the second or any subsequent offense.

(2) The member must include in the notice the date the member intends to terminate service as a full-time firefighter. (3) The termination date shall be at least 30 days later than the date of notice to vest. (4) The member must be in good standing with the fire department on the date of notice to vest. (5) The board shall indicate on the notice to vest the rate of the monthly pay of the member as of the date of the notice to vest or the highest average annual salary which the member received during any five years of service preceding the date, whichever is higher. (c) Notification.-- Upon reaching the date that would have been the member's retirement date had the member continued full-time employment with the fire department, the member shall notify the board in writing that the member desires to collect the member's pension. (d) Computation.-- The amount of retirement benefits the member is entitled to receive under this section shall be computed as follows: (1) The initial determination of the member's base retirement benefits shall be computed on the salary indicated on the notice to vest. (2) The portion of the base retirement benefits due the member shall be determined by applying to the base amount the percentage that the member's years of service rendered bears to the years of service that would have been rendered had the member continued to be employed by the department until the member's minimum retirement date.

      "text": "§ 14322. Pensions and service increments. (a) Payments.-- The following apply: (1) Payments of pensions shall only be a charge on the firefighters pension fund and shall not be a charge on any other fund under the control, or in the treasury, of the city. (2) The basis of the pension of a member shall be determined by the monthly salary of the member at the date of vesting under section 14320.1 (relating to limited vested benefit for firefighters) or retirement or the highest average annual salary which the member received during any five years of service preceding retirement, whichever is higher, whether for disability or by reason of age or service, and, except as to service increments provided for in subsection (b), shall be one-half the annual salary of the member at the time of vesting under section 14320.1 or retirement computed at the monthly or average annual rate, whichever is higher. (3) For payment of pensions to members for permanent injury incurred in service and to families of members killed or who die in service, the amount and commencement of the payment of pensions shall be fixed by regulations of the board of managers. These regulations shall not take into consideration the amount and duration of workers' compensation allowed by law. Payments to surviving spouses of members retired on pension or killed in service on or after January 1, 1960, or who die in service on or after January 1, 1968, shall be the amount payable to the member or which would have been payable had the member been retired at the time of the member's death. (a.1) Home rule and optional charter plans.-- The provisions of subsection (a)(2) shall not apply to a city, whether operating under an optional charter adopted in accordance with the act of July 15, 1957 (P.L.901, No.399), known as the Optional Third Class City Charter Law, or under a home rule charter adopted in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S. Pt. III Subpt. E (relating to home rule and optional plan government), which had pension plans in effect prior to June 19, 2002, that provided pensions in an amount greater than 50% of salary. (b) Service increment.-- In addition to the pension which is authorized to be paid from the firefighters pension fund under this chapter and notwithstanding the limitations placed upon the pensions and upon contributions under this chapter, every contributor entitled to the pension shall also be entitled to the payment of a service increment in accordance with and subject to the conditions imposed under this chapter. (1) A service increment shall be the sum obtained by computing the number of whole years after having served the minimum required by this chapter during which a contributor has been employed by the city and paid out of the city treasury, including credit for military service as provided in section 14321 (relating to retirement and final discharge), and multiplying the number of years by an amount equal to 0.025% of the retirement allowance which has become payable to the contributor in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In computing the service increment, no employment after the contributor has reached 65 years of age shall be included and no service increment shall be paid in excess of $100 per month. (2) After September 18, 1968, each contributor shall pay into the pension fund a monthly sum in addition to the contributor's pension contribution which shall not exceed the sum of $1 per month, provided that the service increment contribution shall not be paid after a contributor has reached 65 years of age. (3) Any individual who is a member of the department on September 18, 1968, and who has reached 65 years of age shall have the individual's service increment computed on the years of employment prior to the member reaching 65 years of age. (4) Service increment contributions shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as pensions and may be withdrawn in full, without interest, by individuals who leave the employment of the city, subject to the same conditions by which retirement contributions may be withdrawn, or by individuals who retire before becoming entitled to any service increment. (5) All members of the fire department who are now contributors to the pension fund and all those employed by the city after September 18, 1968, if required to become contributors to the pension fund, shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. (6) After June 19, 2002, a city may agree to make service increment payments in excess of $100 per month as long as the payments do not exceed $500 per month, and, in computing the service increments, no employment after the contributor has reached 65 years of age shall be included, provided that any agreement to provide an increase in service increment payments shall include a proportionate increase in the amount each contributor shall pay into the retirement fund under paragraph (2), not to exceed $5 per month.",
