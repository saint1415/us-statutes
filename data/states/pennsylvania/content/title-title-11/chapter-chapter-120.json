The compensation of the school crossing guards, if any, shall be fixed by council and shall be jointly paid by council and the board of school directors, in a ratio to be determined by council and the board of school directors. If council and the board of school directors are unable to determine the ratio of compensation of the school crossing guards to be paid by council and the board, each shall pay one-half of the compensation of the school crossing guards.\n\n(b) Ordinance.--\n\n(1) Council may enact an ordinance allowing a board of school directors to assume the hiring and oversight of the school crossing guards. Before council may enact the ordinance, the board of directors of the school district shall adopt a resolution requesting the authority to assume the hiring and oversight of the school crossing guards. The ordinance enacted by council shall outline how the city police department will provide any necessary training and assistance to the school crossing guards while on duty.\n\n(2) School crossing guards shall not fall under the bargaining unit of the school district or be classified as an employee or under any benefits as provided under the act of March 10, 1949 (P.L.30, No.14), known as the Public School Code of 1949. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term employee shall have the same meaning given to the term \"employe\" under section 1101-A of the Public School Code of 1949.\n\n(3) After the ordinance is enacted by council, the school district shall assume the cost of compensation, including fixing the compensation, if any, of the school crossing guards. The board of school directors shall notify council, the mayor and the police chief or commissioner of those hired to serve as school crossing guards and request the necessary training or assistance be provided as outlined by the ordinance.\n\n(c) Duties.--Whether council appoints school crossing guards upon the request of the board of school directors or whether council enacts an ordinance allowing a board of school directors to assume the hiring and oversight of the school crossing guards, the following shall apply to school crossing guards:\n\n(1) Their duties and authority shall be restricted to the management of traffic and pedestrians in and around areas identified by the city police force and the school district superintendent or a designee.\n\n(2) They shall be in suitable and distinctive uniforms while performing their duties as school crossing guards.\n\n(3) They shall not be subject to the civil service provisions of this chapter.\n\n(4) They shall not be entitled to participate in any city or school district pension or benefit plan or plans.\n\n(5) Auxiliary police officers lawfully appointed may be designated by council or hired by the school district, as applicable, to serve as school crossing guards.",
