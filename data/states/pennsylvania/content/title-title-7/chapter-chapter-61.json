The department shall provide written notification to any applicant whose application review has been extended and include the final date by which a decision shall be rendered regarding the application.\n\n(a.1) Investigations.--Upon receipt of an application for a license, the department may conduct an investigation of the applicant or a director, officer, partner, employee, agent or ultimate equitable owner of 10% or more of the applicant as it deems necessary.\n\n(b) Appeal of denial.--If the department refuses to issue a license, it shall notify the applicant in writing of the denial, the reason for the denial and the applicant's right to appeal the denial to the Secretary of Banking. An appeal from the department's refusal to approve an application for a license must be filed by the applicant within 30 days of notice of refusal.\n\n(c) Contents of license.--Each license issued by the department shall specify:\n\n(1) The name and address of the licensee and the address or addresses covered by the license.\n\n(2) The licensee's reference number or unique identifier.\n\n(3) Any other information the department shall require to carry out the purposes of this chapter.\n\n(d) Denial of license due to conviction.--\n\n(1) The department may deny a license if it finds that the applicant or a director, officer, partner, employee, agent or ultimate equitable owner of 10% or more of the applicant has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or felony in any jurisdiction or of a crime which, if committed in this Commonwealth, would constitute a crime of moral turpitude or felony. The department shall deny a mortgage originator license if the applicant has been convicted of any felony during the seven-year period preceding the date of the license application or at any time preceding the date of application, if the felony involved an act of fraud, dishonesty, breach of trust or money laundering, unless the applicant has been pardoned for the conviction.
