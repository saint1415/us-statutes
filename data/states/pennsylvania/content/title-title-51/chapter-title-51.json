(a) Action authorized.-- An action to enjoin or abate a violation of this chapter may be brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by the Attorney General, the district attorney of the county concerned or the solicitor of the municipality in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. The action shall be brought and tried as an action in equity in the court of common pleas of the county in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. (b) Procedure.-- (1) If it is made to appear, by affidavits or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court that a violation exists, a temporary writ of injunction shall forthwith issue, directed to the operator of the adult entertainment establishment or the owner of the premises, or both, restraining the operator or owner from continuing or permitting the continuation of any violation or violations of this chapter until the conclusion of the hearing and a decision by the court. No bond shall be required in instituting such proceedings. This chapter, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity. (2) It shall not be necessary for the court to find the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but, on finding that the material allegations of the petition are true, the court shall order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises be used in violation of this chapter. Upon judgment of the court ordering the violations to be abated, the court may order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises shall be occupied or used for any purpose for up to one year following the date of the court's order, but the court may, in its discretion, permit the premises to be occupied or used by the operator or owner if the operator or owner, or both, posts a bond or a joint bond in the discretion of the court with sufficient surety to be approved by the court in the penal and liquidated sum of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and conditioned that neither the building nor a part of the building be used in violation of this chapter and that the operator will pay all fines, costs and damages that may be assessed for any violation of this chapter upon the premises. (3) Service of any preliminary or permanent injunction shall be made personally upon the operator and owner of the premises if such persons can be found in the county. If the operator or owner cannot be found, a copy of the order shall be delivered to any employee of the operator on the establishment premises or, in the case of the owner, upon an agent, if any. If no employee or agent can be found or service cannot be made on an employee or agent of the owner, then service shall be made as the court may direct. Any person other than the operator or owner who shall be served with any notice of an injunction shall within 24 hours thereafter deliver the notice to the operator or owner, as the case may be, or mail it to the operator or owner by registered mail if the address of the operator or owner, as the case may be, is known to the person served. Suspension by Court Order. Subsec. (b)(1) was suspended July 31, 1997, S.Ct. Order, to the extent that section 5506(b)(1) provides that Chapter 55, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity.",

      "text": "§ 510. Assessment for regulatory expenses upon public utilities. (a) Determination of assessment.-- Before November 1 of each year, the commission shall estimate its total expenditures in the administration of this part for the fiscal year beginning July of the following year, which estimate shall not exceed three-tenths of 1% of the total gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utilities and licensed entities under its jurisdiction for the preceding calendar year, except that the estimate may exceed this amount to reflect Federal funds received by the commission and funds received from other sources to perform functions that are unrelated to the regulation of public utilities and licensed entities. Such estimate shall be submitted to the Governor in accordance with section 610 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929. At the same time the commission submits its estimate to the Governor, the commission shall also submit that estimate to the General Assembly. The commission or its designated representatives shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Governor and the Senate and House Appropriations Committees regarding their estimates. The commission shall subtract from the final estimate: (1) The estimated fees to be collected pursuant to section 317 (relating to fees for services rendered by commission) during such fiscal year. (2) The estimated balance of the appropriation, specified in section 511 (relating to disposition, appropriation and disbursement of assessments and fees), to be carried over into such fiscal year from the preceding one. The remainder so determined, herein called the total assessment, shall be allocated to, and paid by, such public utilities in the manner prescribed. If the General Assembly fails to approve the commission's budget for the purposes of this part, by March 30, the commission shall assess public utilities on the basis of the last approved operating budget. At such time as the General Assembly approves the proposed budget the commission shall have the authority to make an adjustment in the assessments to reflect the approved budget. If, subsequent to the approval of the budget, the commission determines that a supplemental budget may be needed, the commission shall submit its request for that supplemental budget simultaneously to the Governor and the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. (b) Allocation of assessment.-- On or before March 31 of each year, every public utility shall file with the commission a statement under oath showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the preceding calendar year. If any public utility shall fail to file such statement on or before March 31, the commission shall estimate such revenues, which estimate shall be binding upon the public utility for the purposes of this section. For each fiscal year, the allocation shall be made as follows: (1) The commission shall determine for the preceding calendar year the amount of its expenditures directly attributable to the regulation of each group of utilities furnishing the same kind of service, and debit the amount so determined to such group. The commission may, for purposes of the assessment, deem utilities rendering water, sewer or water and sewer service, as defined in the definition of \"public utility\" in section 102 (relating to definitions), as a utility group. (2) The commission shall also determine for the preceding calendar year the balance of its expenditures, not debited as aforesaid, and allocate such balance to each group in the proportion which the gross intrastate operating revenues of such group for that year bear to the gross intrastate operating revenues of all groups for that year. (3) The commission shall then allocate the total assessment prescribed by subsection (a) to each group in the proportion which the sum of the debits made to it bears to the sum of the debits made to all groups. (4) Each public utility within a group shall then be assessed for and shall pay to the commission such proportion of the amount allocated to its group as the gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utility for the preceding calendar year bear to the total gross intrastate operating revenues of its group for that year. (5) (Repealed). (c) Notice, hearing and payment.-- The commission shall give notice by registered or certified mail to each public utility of the amount lawfully charged against it under the provisions of this section, which amount shall be paid by the public utility within 30 days of receipt of such notice, unless the commission specifies on the notices sent to all public utilities an installment plan of payment, in which case each public utility shall pay each installment on or before the date specified therefor by the commission. Within 15 days after receipt of such notice, the public utility against which such assessment has been made may file with the commission objections setting out in detail the grounds upon which the objector regards such assessment to be excessive, erroneous, unlawful or invalid. The commission, after notice to the objector, shall hold a hearing upon such objections. After such hearing, the commission shall record upon its minutes its findings on the objections and shall transmit to the objector, by registered or certified mail, notice of the amount, if any, charged against it in accordance with such findings, which amount or any installment thereof then due, shall be paid by the objector within ten days after receipt of notice of the findings of the commission with respect to such objections. If any payment prescribed by this subsection is not made as aforesaid, the commission may suspend or revoke certificates of public convenience, certify automobile registrations to the Department of Transportation for suspension or revocation or, through the Department of Justice, may institute an appropriate action at law for the amount lawfully assessed, together with any additional cost incurred by the commission or the Department of Justice by virtue of such failure to pay. (d) Suits by public utilities.-- No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the purpose of restraining or in anywise delaying the collection or payment of any assessment made under subsections (a), (b) and (c), but every public utility against which an assessment is made shall pay the same as provided in subsection (c). Any public utility making any such payment may, at any time within two years from the date of payment, sue the Commonwealth in an action at law to recover the amount paid, or any part thereof, upon the ground that the assessment was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, in whole or in part, provided objections, as hereinbefore provided, were filed with the commission, and payment of the assessment was made under protest either as to all or part thereof. In any action for recovery of any payments made under this section, the claimant shall be entitled to raise every relevant issue of law, but the findings of fact made by the commission, pursuant to this section, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. Any records, books, data, documents, and memoranda relating to the expenses of the commission shall be admissible in evidence in any court and shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of their contents. If it is finally determined in any such action that all or any part of the assessment for which payment was made under protest was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, the commission shall make a refund to the claimant out of the appropriation specified in section 511 as directed by the court. (e) Certain provisions not applicable.-- The provisions of this part relating to the judicial review of orders and determinations of the commission shall not be applicable to any findings, determinations, or assessments made under this section. The procedure in this section providing for the determination of the lawfulness of assessments and the recovery back of payments made pursuant to such assessment shall be exclusive of all other remedies and procedures. (f) Intent of section.-- It is the intent and purpose of this section that each public utility subject to this part shall advance to the commission its reasonable share of the cost of administering this part. The commission shall keep records of the costs incurred in connection with the administration and enforcement of this part or any other statute. The commission shall also keep a record of the manner in which it shall have computed the amount assessed against every public utility. Such records shall be open to inspection by all interested parties. The determination of such costs and assessments by the commission, and the records and data upon which the same are made, shall be considered prima facie correct; and in any proceeding instituted to challenge the reasonableness or correctness of any assessment under this section, the party challenging the same shall have the burden of proof. (g) Saving provision.-- This section does not affect or repeal any of the provisions of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), known as the \"Commonwealth Documents Law.\" (Dec. 18, 1980, P.L.1247, No.226, eff. imd.; July 10, 1986, P.L.1238, No.114, eff. imd.; Apr. 4, 1990, P.L.93, No.21, eff. 90 days; June 22, 1990, P.L.241, No.56, eff. 60 days; Dec. 30, 2002, P.L.2001, No.230, eff. 60 days; July 16, 2004, P.L.758, No.94; Oct. 22, 2014, P.L.2545, No.155, eff. 60 days) 2014 Amendment.

(a) Applicability.-- Design professional services shall be procured as provided in this section except as authorized by sections 514 (relating to small procurements), 515 (relating to sole source procurement) and 516 (relating to emergency procurement). (b) Policy.-- It is the policy of this Commonwealth to publicly announce all requirements for design professional services and to award contracts for design professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the types of services required. There shall be a committee to review the qualifications, experience and work of design professionals seeking contracts with purchasing agencies. (c) Selection committees for Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities.-- Where they are authorized by law to act as purchasing agency for design professional services, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities shall each establish as many selection committees as the department deems appropriate and a procedure for the selection of committee members. (d) Selection committee for all other Commonwealth agencies.-- Except as provided for in subsection (c), all purchasing agencies shall use the selection committee appointed by the Governor which shall be composed of five members, none of whom shall be employees of the Commonwealth or hold any elective office or office in any political party. The members shall be architects, engineers or other persons knowledgeable in construction. The members shall serve for terms of two years and shall not be removed except for cause. Of the original members, three shall serve for terms of two years and two for terms of one year. Thereafter, all terms shall be for two years. Each member shall be reimbursed for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred incident to attendance at meetings and to assigned duties and also a per diem allowance in accordance with Commonwealth travel policies. (e) Procedure for selection committees.-- The selection committees shall use the procedure set forth in this subsection: (1) The committee shall give public notice of projects requiring design services and publicly recommend to the purchasing agency three qualified design professionals for each project. (2) If desired, the committee may conduct discussions with three or more professionals regarding anticipated design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment. The committee shall select, based upon criteria established by the head of the purchasing agency, no less than three design professionals deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. In exercising its responsibility, the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) An equitable distribution of contracts to design professionals. (ii) Particular capability to perform the design or construction services for the contract being considered. (iii) Geographic proximity of the design professional to the proposed facility. (iv) The design professional selected has the necessary available personnel to perform the services required by the project. (v) Any other relevant circumstances peculiar to the proposed contract. (f) Design professionals.-- Except as provided for in subsection (g), the head of the purchasing agency shall select design professionals as follows: (1) Where the amount of the base construction allocation is less than $20,000,000, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The fee to be paid to the appointed design professional may be established by the selection committee or may be negotiated at the discretion of the head of the purchasing agency. The $20,000,000 threshold shall be adjusted by the department to reflect the annual percentage change in the Composite Construction Cost Index of the United States Department of Commerce occurring in the one-year period ending December 31 each year. (2) Where the amount of base construction allocation is in excess of or equal to $20,000,000, as annually adjusted, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee to begin contract negotiations. The fee to be paid to the design professional and the terms of the contract between the design professional and the department shall be negotiated by the head of the purchasing agency. In negotiating the contract and the fee, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, uniqueness and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the appointed design professional, negotiations with that design professional shall be terminated, and the head of the purchasing agency shall commence negotiations with one of the other firms chosen by the selection committee. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the second firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall terminate negotiations with the second design professional and commence negotiation with the third firm. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall choose additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this subsection until an agreement is reached. (g) Selection method for Department of Transportation, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Protection and State-affiliated entities.-- In the event the Department of Transportation, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection or a State-affiliated entity otherwise authorized by law to use its own selection committee requires the services of a design professional, the head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall negotiate with the firm determined to be the highest qualified firm for design professional services at a fee which is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth. In making this decision, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee he determines to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The head of the purchasing agency shall then undertake negotiations with the firm he determines to be the second highest qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the third highest qualified firm. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the committee shall select additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

(a) General rule.-- The department shall, upon payment of the required fee, issue to every qualified applicant a driver's license indicating the type or general class of vehicles the licensee is authorized to drive and any endorsements or restrictions, which license, except as provided in subsection (j), shall contain a distinguishing number assigned by the department to the licensee, the actual name, date of birth, residence address, a color photograph or photographic facsimile of the licensee, such other information as may be required by the department, and either a facsimile of the signature of the licensee or a space upon which the licensee shall write his usual signature with pen and ink. Program participants in the Address Confidentiality Program under 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 67 (relating to domestic and sexual violence victim address confidentiality) may use a substitute address designated by the Office of Victim Advocate as their address. Personal medical data and other information for use in an emergency may be included as a part of the license. Information other than that required to identify the licensee, the distinguishing number and the class of license issued may be included in microdata form. Except as provided in subsection (f), an applicant shall include his Social Security number on his license application, but the Social Security number shall not be included on the license. No driver's license shall be valid until it has been signed by the licensee. (a.1) Veteran's driver's license designation.-- (1) Beginning as soon as practicable, but no later than 18 months following the effective date of this subsection, the department shall issue a driver's license or identification card that clearly indicates that the person is a veteran of the United States Armed Forces. A qualified applicant is an individual who has served in the United States Armed Forces, including a reserve component or the National Guard, and who was discharged or released from such service under conditions other than dishonorable. (2) Upon receipt of an application from a qualified applicant accompanied by such documentation as the department shall require, the department shall independently validate the documentation and immediately issue to the veteran a driver's license or identification card displaying a veteran designation without submitting the application or documentation to the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs for review, approval or validation. There shall be no fee for the veteran designation, but the qualified applicant must pay any renewal or duplicate driver's license or identification card fees. (3) The department and the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall enter into an agreement whereby the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall reimburse the Motor License Fund for the department's actual costs of the issuance of a veteran's designation on drivers' licenses and identification cards. Reimbursement shall be paid from the Veterans' Trust Fund or such other funds available for this purpose. (4) A person who falsely represents himself as a veteran of the United States Armed Forces on an application for a driver's license or identification card is subject to the penalty under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904(b) (relating to unsworn falsification to authorities). (b) Identification card.-- The department shall, upon payment of the required fee, issue an identification card to any person ten years of age or older who has made application therefor in such manner as the department shall prescribe or whose driver's license has been surrendered to the department because of a suspension or revocation of an operating privilege under this or any other title. Program participants in the Address Confidentiality Program under 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 67 may use a substitute address designated by the Office of Victim Advocate as their address. Except as provided in subsection (j), the identification card shall have substantially the same content as a driver's license but shall clearly indicate that it is not a driver's license. Upon failure of any person to pass any examination required under section 1514 (relating to expiration and renewal of drivers' licenses), the department shall, where appropriate, issue a complimentary identification card as an expression of gratitude for years of safe driving. The card shall only be issued upon receipt of the person's driver's license. (c) Anatomical donors.-- Any person who is registered as an anatomical organ donor and who has in his possession a card issued by the recipient organization may attach the card to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card in such a way as to permit the removal of this card should the person no longer desire to be designated as an anatomical donor. Any person may also attach to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card a symbol provided by the Department of Health designating a person to be an anatomical donor. The department shall distribute such symbols at all photo license centers and shall make such symbols available in quantity to any political subdivision or organization on request. Information concerning registered donor status may be included as a part of the person's personal medical data. (d) Medical history record.-- Any person may attach to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card information relating to his personal medical history. (e) Use of identification cards.-- If a person has an established policy of accepting a driver's license issued pursuant to subsection (a) for the purpose of identification for the acceptance of a check given for payment of purchase or for the cashing of a check, the person shall also accept an identification card issued pursuant to subsection (b) for the same purpose. It shall be a defense to a prosecution under this subsection that the person was not presented with notice of the provisions of this subsection. (f) Waiver.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the department shall issue a driver's license to an otherwise eligible person who has no Social Security number if the person submits a waiver obtained from the Federal Government permitting him not to have a Social Security number. The department may require other identifiers, including, but not limited to, a taxpayer identification number, before issuing the license. (g) Completion of process.-- (1) For purposes of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-31, 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg et seq.), this subsection applies to statutes requiring determination of completion of the licensing process. (2) The process of issuing a driver's license is complete when a license bearing the licensee's photograph, photographic facsimile or image has been issued by the department. (h) Sale of photographs prohibited.-- Neither the department nor any person under contract with the department shall sell photographs of holders of a driver's license or identification card for any commercial purpose. (i) Issuance to noncitizens.-- A license issued in accordance with section 1506(a.1) (relating to application for driver's license or learner's permit) may contain an indication that the license was issued to the person who is not a citizen of the United States and who has credentials or documents issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service or its successor. (j) Undercover credential.-- The department may issue an undercover credential to Federal, State or local law enforcement officials. The department may establish guidelines concerning the issuance of such undercover credentials and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of these licenses and their issuance.

(a) General rule.-- To convert convertible real estate or add additional real estate pursuant to an option reserved under section 3206(1) (relating to contents of declaration; flexible condominiums), the declarant shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration (section 3219) and comply with section 3210 (relating to plats and plans). The declarant is the unit owner of any units thereby created. The amendment to the declaration must assign an identifying number to each unit formed in the convertible or additional real estate and reallocate common element interests, votes in the association and common expense liabilities. The amendment must describe or delineate any limited common elements formed out of the convertible or additional real estate, showing or designating the unit to which each is allocated to the extent required by section 3209 (relating to limited common elements). (b) Creations within additional real estate.-- Convertible or withdrawable real estate may be created within any additional real estate added to the condominium if the amendment adding that real estate includes all matters required by section 3205 (relating to contents of declaration; all condominiums) or section 3206 (relating to contents of declaration; flexible condominiums), as the case may be, and the plat includes all matters required by section 3210(b) (relating to plats and plans). This provision does not extend the time limit on conversion or contraction of a flexible condominium imposed by the declaration pursuant to section 3206(2). (c) Liability for expenses and right to income.-- Until conversion occurs or the period during which conversion may occur expires, whichever occurs first, the declarant alone is liable for real estate taxes assessed against convertible real estate and all other expenses in connection with that real estate. No other unit owner and no other portion of the condominium is subject to a claim for payment of those taxes or expenses.

(d) Rights and responsibilities of persons electing governing body.-- The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in sections 3303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 3308 (relating to meetings), 3309 (relating to quorums), 3310 (relating to voting; proxies) and 3320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association with respect to the exercise of powers delegated pursuant to a condominium declaration to such master association, but apply only to those persons who elect the governing body of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this subpart. (e) Election of master association governing body.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3303(e) with respect to the election of the executive board by all unit owners after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 3301, the instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each condominium or the organizational documents of other associations the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association shall provide that the governing body of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways: (1) All unit owners of all condominiums and other properties subject to the master association elect all members of the governing body of the master association. (2) All members of the governing bodies of the condominium associations and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect all members of the master association governing body. (3) All unit owners of each condominium and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (4) All members of the governing bodies of the condominiums and other property associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (f) Delegation of responsibility and authority.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to a condominium if and when: (1) there occurs either a date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the condominium; (2) there occurs an event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable, and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that: (i) such event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the condominium; and (ii) that a copy of such instrument has been sent to all unit owners; or (3) the declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the condominium and that a copy of such instrument has been sent to the executive board and all unit owners. Paragraph (3) shall be applicable only if the declarant shall have expressly reserved in the declaration, pursuant to section 3205(12) (relating to contents of declaration; all condominiums), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the condominium and only if the instrument exercising such right shall have been recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right. (g) Delegation of all powers.-- If all the powers of a condominium association are delegated to a master association and accepted by such master association pursuant to subsection (b), then the governing body of the master association may act in all respects as the executive board of the condominium and no separate executive board need be elected or exist.

(a) General rule.-- Any two or more condominiums by agreement of the unit owners as provided in subsection (b) may be merged or consolidated into a single condominium. In the event of a merger or consolidation, unless the agreement otherwise provides, the resultant condominium is, for all purposes, the legal successor of all of the preexisting condominiums, and the operations and activities of all associations of the preexisting condominiums shall be merged or consolidated into a single association which shall hold all powers, rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of all preexisting associations. The resultant condominium shall, in addition, be subject in all respects to the provisions and requirements of this subpart regardless of whether or not any of the preexisting condominiums shall have been established under this subpart. (b) Requirements of agreement.-- The merger or consolidation of two or more condominiums pursuant to subsection (a) must be evidenced by a recorded agreement duly executed by the president of the association of each of the preexisting condominiums following approval by owners of units to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each condominium required to terminate such condominium. Any such agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is located and is not effective until so recorded. (c) Reallocations.-- Every merger or consolidation agreement must provide for the reallocation of the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association among the units of the resulting condominium either: (1) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based; or (2) by stating the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association which are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting condominiums, and providing that the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the association for the resulting condominium shall be the same as was allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting condominium by the declaration of the preexisting condominium. (d) Action by declarant.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), if a declarant expressly retained the special declarant right to merge or consolidate a condominium pursuant to section 3205(13) (relating to contents of declaration; all condominiums) and if the declarant exercised such right within the time period allowed for such exercise by giving written notice to that effect to all unit owners accompanied by a copy of the agreement evidencing such merger or consolidation, then such agreement may be executed by the declarant rather than by the president of the association of that condominium and without the necessity for approval or consent by unit owners or their mortgagees, provided that the agreement is recorded within the time period allowed for the exercise of this special declarant right.

      "text": "§ 3224. Coal operator responsibilities. (a) General rule.-- At any time prior to removing coal or other underground materials from, or extending the workings in, a coal mine within 500 feet of an oil or gas well of which the coal operator has knowledge, or within 500 feet of an approved well location of which the coal operator has knowledge, the coal operator, by certified mail, shall forward to or file with the well operator and the department a copy of the relevant part of all maps and plans which it is presently required by law to prepare and file with the department, showing the pillar which the coal operator proposes to leave in place around each oil or gas well in the projected workings. Thereafter, the coal operator may proceed with mining operations in the manner projected on the maps and plans, but the operator may not remove coal or cut a passageway within 150 feet of the well or approved well location without written approval under this section. If, in the opinion of the well operator or the department, the plan indicates that the proposed pillar is inadequate to protect either the integrity of the well or public health and safety, the affected well operator shall attempt to reach an agreement with the coal operator on a suitable pillar, subject to approval of the department. Upon failure to agree, the well operator may, within ten days after receipt of the proposed plan under this section, file objections under section 3251 (relating to conferences), indicating the size of the pillar to be left as to each well. If objections are not timely filed and the department has none, the department shall grant approval, reciting that maps and plans have been filed, no objections have been made thereto and the pillar proposed to be left for each well is approved in the manner as projected. (b) Objections.-- If an objection is filed by the well operator or raised by the department, the department shall order that a conference be held under section 3251 within ten days of the filing of objections. At the conference, the coal operator and the person who has objected shall attempt to agree on a proposed plan, showing the pillar to be left around each well, which will satisfy the objections and receive department approval. If an agreement is reached, the department shall grant approval to the coal operator, reciting that a plan has been filed and the pillar to be left for each well is approved pursuant to the agreement. If an agreement is not reached on a plan showing the pillar to be left with respect to a well, the department, by appropriate order, shall determine the pillar to be left with respect to the well. In a proceeding under this section, the department shall follow as nearly as is possible the original plan filed by the coal operator. The department shall not require the coal operator to leave a pillar in excess of 100 feet in radius, except that the department may require a pillar of up to 150 feet in radius if the existence of unusual conditions is established. Pillars determined by the department shall be shown on maps or plans on file with the department as provided in subsection (a), and the department shall approve the pillar to be left for each well. (c) Pillars of reduced size.-- Application may be made at any time to the department by the coal operator to leave a pillar of a size smaller than shown on the plan approved or determined by the department under this section. If an application is filed, the department shall: (1) follow the appropriate procedure under subsection (a) or (b); (2) by appropriate order, determine a plan involving a pillar of a smaller size as to any well covered by the application; and (3) have the discretion to grant approval for the pillar to be left with respect to each well. (d) Violation.-- No coal operator, without written approval of the department after notice and opportunity for a hearing under this section, shall remove coal or cut a passageway so as to leave a pillar of smaller size, with respect to an oil or gas well, than that approved by the department under this chapter. (e) Limitation.-- With regard to a coal pillar required by law to be left around a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to: (1) require a well operator to pay for the coal pillar; (2) affect a right which a coal operator may have had prior to April 18, 1985, to obtain payment for the coal pillar; or (3) affect a duty or right which a storage operator or landowner may have had prior to April 18, 1985, to pay or not pay for the coal pillar. (f) Mining through plugged wells.-- A coal operator who intends to mine through a plugged oil or gas well or otherwise completely remove any pillar from around that well shall file a plan under subsection (a) which shall be subject to all of the provisions of this section. No coal operator may mine through a plugged oil or gas well of which he has knowledge until written approval has been granted by the department in accordance with this section. The Bureau of Deep Mine Safety in the department shall have the authority to establish conditions under which the department may approve a coal operator's plan to mine through a plugged oil or gas well.",

      "text": "§ 3225. Bonding. (a) General rule.-- The following shall apply: (1) Except as provided in subsection (d), upon filing an application for a well permit and before continuing to operate an oil or gas well, the owner or operator of the well shall file with the department a bond covering the well and well site on a form to be prescribed and furnished by the department. A bond filed with an application for a well permit shall be payable to the Commonwealth and conditioned upon the operator's faithful performance of all drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. A bond for a well in existence on April 18, 1985, shall be payable to the Commonwealth and conditioned upon the operator's faithful performance of all water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The amount of the bond required shall be in the following amounts and amounts under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) may be adjusted by the Environmental Quality Board every two years to reflect the projected costs to the Commonwealth of plugging the well: (i) For unconventional wells with a total well bore length less than 6,000 feet: (A) For operating up to 50 wells, $4,000 per well, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $35,000. (B) For operating 51 to 150 wells, $35,000 plus $4,000 per well for each well in excess of 50 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $60,000. (C) For operating 151 to 250 wells, $60,000 plus $4,000 per well for each well in excess of 150 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $100,000. (D) For operating more than 250 wells, $100,000 plus $4,000 per well for each well in excess of 250 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $250,000. (ii) For unconventional wells with a total well bore length of at least 6,000 feet: (A) For operating up to 25 wells, $10,000 per well, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $140,000. (B) For operating 26 to 50 wells, $140,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 25 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $290,000. (C) For operating 51 to 150 wells, $290,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 50 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $430,000. (D) For operating more than 150 wells, $430,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 150 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $600,000. (iii) For a well other than an unconventional well, $2,500 per well. For 10 years following the effective date of this subparagraph, the Environmental Quality Board and the department shall have no authority to adjust the amount under this subparagraph. (2) The following apply: (i) Except as provided under subparagraph (ii), in lieu of individual bonds for each well, an owner or operator may file a blanket bond for the applicable amount under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii), on a form prepared by the department, covering all of its wells in this Commonwealth, as enumerated on the bond form. (ii) As follows: (A) An operator may file a blanket bond of $25,000 for all of the operator's wells in this Commonwealth that are not unconventional wells. (B) For every new well that is not an unconventional well drilled after six months after the effective date of this subsection, the bond amount for that operator shall increase by $1,000. (C) The total blanket bond for an operator's wells that are not unconventional wells shall not exceed $100,000. (D) The blanket bond increase of $1,000 shall be waived by the department for a new well drilled under this subsection if the operator provides evidence to the department that the operator has plugged an orphan well at the operator's own expense for which the operator was not the responsible party within the previous 365 days that the operator has not yet received credit for under this subsection by the department. (E) For 10 years following the effective date of this clause, the bond amounts for wells that are not unconventional wells may only be revised by the General Assembly. The Environmental Quality Board and the department shall have no authority to adjust bond amounts related to wells that are not unconventional wells during that time period. (2.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, section 1934-A of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929, shall continue to apply to a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985. (3) Liability under the bond shall continue until the well has been properly plugged in accordance with this chapter and for a period of one year after filing of the certificate of plugging with the department. Each bond shall be executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do business in this Commonwealth and approved by the secretary. In lieu of a corporate surety, the operator may deposit with the department: (i) cash; (ii) certificates of deposit or automatically renewable irrevocable letters of credit, from financial institutions chartered or authorized to do business in this Commonwealth and regulated and examined by the Commonwealth or a Federal agency, which may be terminated at the end of a term only upon 90 days' prior written notice by the financial institution to the permittee and the department; (iii) negotiable bonds of the United States Government or the Commonwealth, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, the General State Authority, the State Public School Building Authority or any municipality within the Commonwealth; or (iv) United States Treasury Bonds issued at a discount without a regular schedule of interest payments to maturity, otherwise known as Zero Coupon Bonds, having a maturity date of not more than ten years after the date of purchase and at the maturity date having a value of not less than the applicable amount under paragraph (1). The cash deposit, certificate of deposit, amount of the irrevocable letter of credit or market value of the securities shall be equal at least to the sum of the bond. (4) The secretary shall, upon receipt of a deposit of cash, letters of credit or negotiable bonds, immediately place the same with the State Treasurer, whose duty it shall be to receive and hold the same in the name of the Commonwealth, in trust, for the purpose for which the deposit is made. (5) The State Treasurer shall at all times be responsible for custody and safekeeping of deposits. The operator making the deposit shall be entitled from time to time to demand and receive from the State Treasurer, on the written order of the secretary, the whole or any portion of collateral deposited, upon depositing with the State Treasurer, in lieu of that collateral, other collateral of classes specified in this section having a market value at least equal to the sum of the bond, and also to demand, receive and recover the interest and income from the negotiable bonds as they become due and payable. (6) If negotiable bonds on deposit under this subsection mature or are called, the State Treasurer, at the request of the owner of the bonds, shall convert them into other negotiable bonds, of classes specified in this section, designated by the owner. (7) If notice of intent to terminate a letter of credit is given, the department shall give the operator 30 days' written notice to replace the letter of credit with other acceptable bond guarantees as provided in this section. If the owner or operator fails to timely replace the letter of credit, the department shall draw upon and convert the letter of credit into cash and hold it as a collateral bond guarantee. (b) Release.-- No bond shall be fully released until the requirements of subsection (a) and section 3223 (relating to notification and effect of well transfer) have been fully met. Upon release of bonds and collateral under this section, the State Treasurer shall immediately return to the owner the specified amount of cash or securities. (c) Noncompliance.-- If a well owner or operator fails or refuses to comply with subsection (a), regulations promulgated under this chapter or conditions of a permit relating to this chapter, the department may declare the bond forfeited and shall certify the same to the Attorney General, who shall proceed to enforce and collect the full amount of the bond and, if the well owner or operator has deposited cash or securities as collateral in lieu of a corporate surety, the department shall declare the collateral forfeited and direct the State Treasurer to pay the full amount of the funds into the Well Plugging Restricted Revenue Account or to sell the security to the extent forfeited and pay the proceeds into the Well Plugging Restricted Revenue Account. If a corporate surety or financial institution fails to pay a forfeited bond promptly and in full, the corporate surety or financial institution shall be disqualified from writing further bonds under this chapter or any other environmental law administered by the department. A person aggrieved by reason of forfeiting the bond or converting collateral, as provided in this section, shall have a right to appeal to the Environmental Hearing Board in the manner provided by law. Upon forfeiture of a blanket bond for a violation occurring at one or more well sites, the person whose bond is forfeited shall, within ten days of the forfeiture, submit a replacement bond to cover all other wells of which the person is an owner or operator. Failure to submit the replacement bond constitutes a violation of this section as to each of the wells owned or operated by the person. (d) Alternatives to certain bonds.-- The following shall apply: (1) An operator of not more than 200 wells who cannot obtain a bond for a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985, as required under subsection (a), due to inability to demonstrate sufficient financial resources may, in lieu of the bond: (i) Submit to the department a fee in the amount of $50 per well, a blanket fee of $500 for ten to 20 wells or a blanket fee of $1,000 for more than 20 wells, which shall be a nonrefundable fee paid each year that the operator has not filed a bond with the department. All fees collected in lieu of a bond under this subsection shall be used for the purposes authorized by this chapter. The Environmental Quality Board shall have the power, by regulation, to increase the amount of the fees established under this subsection. (ii) Make phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond, subject to the following: (A) Payment shall be based on the number of wells owned or operated. The operator shall make an initial deposit and make annual deposits in accordance with the schedule in clause (B). Interest accumulated by the collateral shall become a part of the bond until the collateral plus accumulated interest equals the amount of the required bond. The collateral shall be deposited, in trust, with the State Treasurer as provided in this subsection or with a bank selected by the department which shall act as trustee for the benefit of the Commonwealth to guarantee the operator's compliance with the drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The operator shall be required to pay all costs of the trust. (B) An operator of up to ten existing wells who does not intend to operate additional wells shall deposit $250 per well and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $50 per well until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 11 to 25 wells or an operator of up to ten wells who applies for one or more permits for additional wells shall deposit $2,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,150 plus $150 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 26 to 50 wells shall deposit $3,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,300 plus $400 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 51 to 100 wells shall deposit $4,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,500 plus $400 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. Operators of 101 to 200 wells shall deposit $8,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,600 plus $1,000 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. Operators of more than 200 wells shall fully bond their wells immediately. (C) The department shall reduce the amount of phased collateral payments or the period of time over which phased collateral payments shall be made on behalf of owners or operators who, prior to August 1, 1992, have paid a fee in lieu of bond under subparagraph (i), and who, by August 1, 1993, choose to enter the phased collateral program under this subparagraph rather than continue to make payments in lieu of bond. Payments made prior to August 1, 1992, in lieu of bond shall not be credited in any other manner, and the department shall not be required to refund the fees. The Environmental Quality Board, by regulation, may change the annual deposits established under clause (B) if necessary to accommodate a change in the amount of the bond required under this section. (2) An operator may continue to pay a fee in lieu of bond or make phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond so long as the operator does not miss a payment under this subsection and remains in compliance with this chapter. If an operator misses a payment under this subsection, the operator shall: (i) immediately submit the appropriate bond amount in full; or (ii) cease all operations and plug all wells. (d.1) Individuals.-- The following shall apply: (1) An individual who is unable to obtain a bond to drill new wells due to inability to demonstrate financial resources may meet the collateral bond requirements of subsection (a) by making phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond. The individual shall be limited to drilling ten new wells per calendar year and, for each well to be drilled, deposit $500 and make an annual deposit of 10% of the remaining bond amount for a period of ten years. Interest accumulated shall become a part of the bond until the collateral plus accumulated interest equals the amount of the required bond. The collateral shall be deposited in trust with the State Treasurer under subsection (a) or with a bank selected by the department which shall act as trustee for the benefit of the Commonwealth to guarantee the individual's compliance with the drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The individual shall pay all costs of the trust. (2) Individuals may continue to use phased collateral to obtain permits if they have not missed a payment for a well drilled under this provision and remain in compliance with this chapter. If an individual misses a payment, the individual shall: (i) immediately submit the appropriate bond amount in full; or (ii) cease all operations and plug all wells. (3) For purposes of this subsection, an \"individual\" means a natural person doing business under his own name. (e) Reservation of remedies.-- All remedies for violations of this chapter, regulations adopted under this chapter and conditions of permits are expressly preserved. Nothing in this section shall be construed as an exclusive penalty or remedy for violations of law. No action taken under this section shall waive or impair any other remedy or penalty provided in law. (f) Change of law.-- Owners or operators who have failed to meet the requirements of this section prior to August 1, 1992, shall not be required to make payments under this section on a retroactive basis as a condition of obtaining a permit under this chapter, nor shall the failure be deemed a violation of this chapter. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"well site\" means areas occupied by all equipment or facilities necessary for or incidental to drilling, production or plugging a well.

(d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart. (2) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made pursuant to this subpart. An amendment to the declaration or bylaws authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the declaration and bylaws being amended. If any such amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this subpart, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in this subpart also apply to that person. (e) Cooperative interests outside Commonwealth.-- This subpart does not apply to cooperative interests located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions (sections 4401 through 4408) apply to all cooperative interests offered within this Commonwealth for which either the contract for disposition is executed by any party within this Commonwealth or the disposition is effectuated within this Commonwealth unless exempt under section 4401(b) (relating to applicability; waiver). (f) Liens and security interests.-- The enactment of this subpart shall not affect any lien upon a cooperative or any lien upon or security interest in any property of the association or in any cooperative interest if such lien or security interest shall have been perfected prior to the effective date of this subpart.

(d) Extension of inspection period.-- The department may extend the time for any of the inspections required by this chapter for not more than 30 days due to weather conditions or other causes which render compliance with the provisions of this chapter within the prescribed time difficult or impossible. (e) Prohibition on centralized inspection.-- The department shall not require or direct the use of a centralized safety inspection program for purposes of performing vehicle safety inspections. (f) Emission inspection.-- Subject vehicles operated in this Commonwealth must be emission inspected as provided in section 4706 (relating to prohibition on expenditures for emission inspection program).

If there is no evidence of emission inspection, an emission inspection must precede the next registration renewal. (4) Emission inspection criteria for vehicles operated with miscellaneous motor vehicle business registration plates or dealer registration plate.-- A subject vehicle which displays a miscellaneous motor vehicle business registration plate or a dealer registration plate shall be exempt from the requirements for emission inspection until it has accumulated 5,000 miles on its odometer.

(a) General rule.-- If a unit is acquired by eminent domain or if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain leaving the unit owner with a remnant which may not practically or lawfully be used for any purpose permitted by the declaration, the award shall compensate the unit owner for the unit and, except for the value, if any, of the interest of other units in any controlled facilities that were at the time of the taking a part of the unit subject to the taking, its appurtenant interest in the planned community reflected by its allocated common expenses liability, whether or not any common elements are acquired. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, the unit's allocated votes and liabilities shall automatically be reallocated to the remaining units in proportion to the respective allocated votes and liabilities of those units before the taking. The association shall promptly prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Any remnant of a unit remaining after part of a unit is taken under this subsection shall be a common facility. (b) Acquisition of part of unit.-- Except as provided in subsection (a), if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain, the award shall compensate the unit owner for the reduction in value of the unit and its appurtenant interest in the planned community, whether or not any common facilities or controlled facilities are acquired, and shall compensate the association for the value, if any, of the interest of other units in any controlled facilities that were at the time of the taking a part of the unit subject to the taking. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, the following shall apply: (1) The unit's appurtenant votes in the association and common expense liability shall be reduced on the basis specified in the declaration with respect to the reallocation of votes and common expense liability in the event of eminent domain or, if the declaration does not specify a basis, as initially allocated based on the formulae stated in the declaration under section 5208 (relating to allocation of votes and common expense liabilities). (2) The portion of the appurtenant votes and common expense liability divested from the partially acquired unit shall be automatically reallocated to that unit and the remaining units in proportion to the respective appurtenant votes and liabilities of those units before the taking, with the partially acquired unit participating in the reallocation on the basis of its reduced allocated votes and liabilities. (c) Acquisition of part of common facilities.-- If part of the common facilities is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the award attributable to the interest of the association in the common facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining common facilities among the unit owners in proportion to the common expense liability attributable to the units before the taking, but any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common facility shall be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that limited common facility was allocated at the time of acquisition or in any manner as provided in the declaration. (d) Acquisition of part of controlled facilities.-- If, as part of a unit acquired by eminent domain, controlled facilities are taken which benefit other units, that portion of the award attributable to the interest of the other units in the controlled facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining controlled facilities equally among the unit owners whose units were benefited by the controlled facilities that have been taken.

      "text": "§ 5208. Allocation of votes and common expense liabilities. (a) General rule.-- The declaration shall allocate a fraction or percentage of the common expenses of the association and a portion of the votes in the association to each unit and state the formulas used to establish those allocations. Such formulas may take into account unusual attributes of identified units if the formulas state how the deviation from the normal rule applies to such units. (b) Flexible planned communities.-- If units may be added, including by conversion of convertible real estate to one or more units, to or withdrawn from the planned community, the declaration shall state the formulas to be used to reallocate the fractions, as percentages of the allocated share of the common expenses of the association and the percentages of votes in the association, among all units included in the planned community after the addition or withdrawal. (c) Votes.-- (1) Each unit shall be allocated one or more votes in the association. The declaration shall specify how votes in the association shall be allocated among the units and may provide: (i) for different allocations of votes among units on particular matters specified in the declaration; and (ii) for class voting on specified issues affecting a particular class of units if necessary to protect the valid interests of the owners of such units and not affecting units outside of the class. (2) Cumulative voting shall only be permitted if so provided expressly in the declaration and only for the purpose of electing members of the executive board. A declarant may not utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evading any limitation imposed on declarants by this subpart. The declaration may provide that different allocations of votes shall be made to the units in particular matters specified in the declaration. (d) Alteration or partition of allocations.-- Except as provided in section 5107 (relating to eminent domain), 5211 (relating to conversion and expansion of flexible planned communities), 5212 (relating to withdrawal of withdrawable real estate), 5214 (relating to relocation of boundaries between units) or 5215 (relating to subdivision or conversion of units), the votes and common expense liability allocated to any unit may not be changed without the consent of all unit owners whose allocated votes and common expense liabilities are changed. The common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which it is allocated is void. (e) Calculations for undivided interests.-- Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the common expense liabilities allocated at any time to all the units must equal one if stated as a fraction or 100% if stated as percentages. If there is a discrepancy between the allocated common expense liability and the result derived from application of the formulas, the allocated common expense liability prevails. Cross References.

That allocation may not be altered without the consent of the unit owners whose units are affected.

The persons executing assignment or the amendment to the declaration shall provide a copy to the association.

(a) Action authorized.-- An action to enjoin or abate a violation of this chapter may be brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by the Attorney General, the district attorney of the county concerned or the solicitor of the municipality in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. The action shall be brought and tried as an action in equity in the court of common pleas of the county in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. (b) Procedure.-- (1) If it is made to appear, by affidavits or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court that a violation exists, a temporary writ of injunction shall forthwith issue, directed to the operator of the adult entertainment establishment or the owner of the premises, or both, restraining the operator or owner from continuing or permitting the continuation of any violation or violations of this chapter until the conclusion of the hearing and a decision by the court. No bond shall be required in instituting such proceedings. This chapter, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity. (2) It shall not be necessary for the court to find the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but, on finding that the material allegations of the petition are true, the court shall order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises be used in violation of this chapter. Upon judgment of the court ordering the violations to be abated, the court may order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises shall be occupied or used for any purpose for up to one year following the date of the court's order, but the court may, in its discretion, permit the premises to be occupied or used by the operator or owner if the operator or owner, or both, posts a bond or a joint bond in the discretion of the court with sufficient surety to be approved by the court in the penal and liquidated sum of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and conditioned that neither the building nor a part of the building be used in violation of this chapter and that the operator will pay all fines, costs and damages that may be assessed for any violation of this chapter upon the premises. (3) Service of any preliminary or permanent injunction shall be made personally upon the operator and owner of the premises if such persons can be found in the county. If the operator or owner cannot be found, a copy of the order shall be delivered to any employee of the operator on the establishment premises or, in the case of the owner, upon an agent, if any. If no employee or agent can be found or service cannot be made on an employee or agent of the owner, then service shall be made as the court may direct. Any person other than the operator or owner who shall be served with any notice of an injunction shall within 24 hours thereafter deliver the notice to the operator or owner, as the case may be, or mail it to the operator or owner by registered mail if the address of the operator or owner, as the case may be, is known to the person served. Suspension by Court Order. Subsec. (b)(1) was suspended July 31, 1997, S.Ct.

(a) Employer contribution rate on behalf of active members.-- For each fiscal year, the amount of the Commonwealth and other employer contributions on behalf of all active members shall be computed by the actuary as a percentage of the total compensation of all active members during the period for which the amount is determined and shall be so certified by the board. The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall consist of the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b), and the accrued liability contribution rate as defined in subsection (c). The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall be modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in subsection (f). (b) Employer normal contribution rate.-- The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined after each actuarial valuation on the basis of an annual interest rate and such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the board in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined as follows: (1) From the effective date of this paragraph through fiscal year 2021-2022, as a level percentage of the compensation of the average new active member, which percentage, if contributed on the basis of his prospective compensation through his entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to him in excess of that portion funded by his prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (2) For fiscal year 2022-2023 and each fiscal year thereafter, as a level percentage of the compensation of all active members, which percentage, if contributed from the start of their employment on the basis of their prospective compensation through their entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to them in excess of that portion funded by their prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (c) Accrued liability contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2003, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits, except for the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708 (relating to supplemental annuities), 5708.1 (relating to additional supplemental annuities), 5708.2 (relating to further additional supplemental annuities), 5708.3 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1994), 5708.4 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment), 5708.5 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1998), 5708.6 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2002), 5708.7 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2003) and 5708.8 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002), in excess of the total assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all investment gains and losses over a five-year period), excluding the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members on December 31, 2001, and excluding contributions to be transferred by county retirement systems or pension plans pursuant to section 5507(c) (relating to contributions to the system by the Commonwealth and other employers). The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002, except that, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2002, but before July 1, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded over a period of ten years from the first day of July, coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution for such additional legislative liabilities shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the first annual payment. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, the outstanding balance of the increase in accrued liability due to the change in benefits enacted in 2001 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2002, and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in calendar year 2002 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2003. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2003, but before January 1, 2009, such additional liability shall be funded in equal dollar annual contributions over a period of ten years from the first day of July coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. (3) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund in equal dollar installments over a period of 30 years from July 1, 2010, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits calculated as of the immediately prior valuation date, including the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8, but excluding the benefits payable from the retirement benefit plan established pursuant to section 5941 (relating to benefits completion plan), in excess of the actuarially calculated assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses each year in level annual installments over five years), including the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer will receive for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members, inactive members on leave without pay, vestees and special vestees on December 31, 2009. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (4) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as provided for under this section, except that the rate shall be computed as a rate of total compensation of all active members and active participants for the applicable period and the accrued liability shall be determined and the rate shall be computed without regard to the portion of any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h) for which an annual setoff has not been credited or recognized in a prior fiscal year. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2016, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. In addition to any employer defined contributions made to the trust, the Commonwealth and other employers of participants shall make the accrued liability contributions to the fund certified by the board. (d) Special provisions on calculating contributions.-- In calculating the contributions required by subsections (a), (b) and (c), the active members of Class C shall be considered to be members of Class A. In addition, the actuary shall determine the Commonwealth or other employer contributions required for active members of Class C and officers of the Pennsylvania State Police and enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board who are members of Class A to finance their benefits in excess of those to which other members of Class A are entitled. Such additional contributions shall be determined separately for officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police and for enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. Such contributions payable on behalf of officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police shall include the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of May 12, 1943 (P.L.259, No.120), referred to as the Foreign Casualty Insurance Premium Tax Allocation Law, and on behalf of enforcement officers or investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of April 12, 1951 (P.L.90, No.21), known as the Liquor Code. (e) Supplemental annuity contribution rate.-- (1) For the period July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4 and 5708.5 shall be paid over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002. The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2002 provided for in section 5708.6 shall be as provided in section 5708.6(f). The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2003 provided for in section 5708.7 shall be as provided in section 5708.7(f). The funding for the special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002 under section 5708.8 shall be as provided in section 5708.8(g). The amount of each annual supplemental annuities contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002. (2) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8 shall be paid as part of the accrued liability contribution rate as provided for in subsection (c)(3), and there shall not be a separate supplemental annuity contribution rate attributable to those supplemental annuities. In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (f) Experience adjustment factor.-- (1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability and any increase or decrease in the liabilities and funding for supplemental annuities, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience (recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses over a five-year period), changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, State employees making shared-risk member contributions or having shared-gain adjustments to their regular member contributions, payment of additional accrued liability contributions under section 5507(g), changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of 30 years beginning with the July 1 succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases. The experience adjustment factor calculated under this paragraph shall be determined without regard to any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h). (2) The actuarially required contribution rate shall be the sum of the normal contribution rate, the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate, modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in paragraph (1). (g) Determination of liability for special vestee.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or other law, the total additional accrued actuarial liability resulting from eligibility of special vestees for benefits upon the attainment of superannuation age shall be determined by the actuary as part of the first annual valuation made after June 30, 1997. The resulting additional accrued actuarial liability shall be paid by The Pennsylvania State University to the board in one lump sum payment within 90 days of the board's certification of the amount to The Pennsylvania State University. (h) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.-- The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation to the prior year's final contribution rate. If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by the respective percentage above of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all subsequent fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not apply. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of total compensation of all active members. (i) Final contribution rate.-- For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate shall be 5% of total compensation of all active members. For each subsequent fiscal year for which the collared contribution rate is applicable, the final contribution rate shall be the collared contribution rate plus the costs added by legislation. For all other fiscal years, the final contribution rate shall be the actuarially required contribution rate, provided that the final contribution rate shall not be less than the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b).

If the sum of the products of the number of years and fractional part of a year of credited service in each class and the appropriate class of service multiplier is greater than 16.667, the disability annuity shall be a single life annuity that is equal to the sum of the standard single life annuities determined separately for each class of service multiplied by the appropriate class of service multiplier, otherwise each standard single life annuity shall be multiplied by the lesser of the following ratios: MY*/Y or 16.667/Y Where Y = total number of years of credited service; Y* = total years of credited service if the member were to continue as a State employee until attaining superannuation age as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, or if the member has attained superannuation age, as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, then the number of years of credited service and M = the class of service multiplier as applicable to that class of service at the effective date of disability. A member of Class C shall receive, in addition, any annuity to which he may be eligible under section 5702(a)(3) (relating to maximum single life annuity). The member shall be entitled to the election of a joint and survivor annuity on that portion of the disability annuity to which he is entitled under section 5702. (b) Benefit attributable to social security integration credit.-- If the member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and has social security integration credits as provided in section 5305 (relating to social security integration credits), he may elect to withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions or if he has five or more eligibility points to his credit and does not withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions he may execute an application to be filed with the board to receive, in addition to his disability annuity, an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702(a)(2). (c) Reduction on account of earned income.-- Subsequent to January 1, 1972, payments on account of disability shall be reduced by that amount by which the earned income of the annuitant, as reported in accordance with section 5908(b) (relating to rights and duties of annuitants), for the preceding calendar year together with the disability annuity payments provided in this section other than subsection (b), for the year, exceeds the product of: (1) the last year's salary of the annuitant as a member of the system; and (2) the ratio of the current monthly payment to the monthly payment at the effective date of disability; Provided, That the annuitant shall not receive less than his member's annuity or the amount to which he may be entitled under section 5702 whichever is greater. (d) Reduction on account of ineligibility.-- Payment of that portion of the disability annuity in excess of the annuity to which the annuitant was entitled at the effective date of disability calculated in accordance with section 5702 shall cease if the annuitant is no longer eligible under the provisions of sections 5905(c)(2) or 5908(b) or (c). (e) Termination of State service.-- Upon termination of disability annuity payments in excess of an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702, a disability annuitant who does not return to State service may file an application with the board for an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of the shared-risk accumulated deductions plus the regular and additional accumulated deductions standing to his credit at the effective date of disability over one-third of the total disability annuity payments received. If the annuitant on the date of termination of service was eligible for an annuity as provided in section 5308(a) or (b) (relating to eligibility for annuities), he may file an application with the board for an election of an optional modification of his annuity.

(f) Supplement for service connected disability.-- (1) If a member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and if the disability has been found to be a service connected disability and if the member is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits, such member shall receive a supplement equal to the amount determined under paragraph (2) less the sum of the annuity as determined under subsection (a) and any payments paid or payable on account of such disability under the act of June 2, 1915 (P.L.736, No.338), known as the Workers' Compensation Act, the act of June 21, 1939 (P.L.566, No.284), known as The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act, and the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.). Such supplement shall continue as long as he is determined to be disabled and is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits on account of his service connected disability in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act or The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act. If the member has received a lump sum workers' compensation payment in lieu of future weekly compensation payments, the length in weeks and calculation of the service connected disability supplement shall be determined by dividing the lump sum payment by the average weekly wage as determined by the Workers' Compensation Board. (2) For a member who does not have Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be 70% of the member's final average salary. For a member who has Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be calculated according to the following formula: A = .7[(Y W MULTIPLIED BY FAS W )+(Y P MULTIPLIED BY FAS P )] Y T Y T (3) The following apply to the formula in paragraph (2): (i) A equals the amount used to determine the supplement; (ii) Y T equals total years of credited service; (iii) Y W equals years of credited service that are not Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (iv) FAS W equals final average salary calculated for credited service other than Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (v) Y P equals years of service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; and (vi) FAS P equals final average salary calculated for service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service. (g) Limitation regarding annual benefit under IRC § 415.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this part to the contrary, no benefit shall be payable to the extent that such benefit exceeds any limitation under IRC § 415 as in effect with respect to governmental plans as such term is defined in IRC § 414(d) on the date the benefit payment becomes effective, provided however, that any increase in any limitation under IRC § 415 shall be applicable to all current and future annuitants and survivor annuitants. (h) Coordination of benefits.-- The determination and payment of a disability annuity under this section is in addition to any payments a member may be entitled to receive, has received or is receiving as a result of being a participant in the plan.

      "text": "§ 5706. Termination of annuities. (a) General rule.-- (1) If the annuitant returns to State service or enters or has entered school service and elects multiple service membership, any annuity payable to him under this part shall cease effective upon the date of his return to State service or entering school service without regard to whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member of the system or participant in the plan or, if a multiple service member, whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member or participant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System or School Employees' Defined Contribution Plan; and, in the case of an annuity other than a disability annuity the present value of such annuity, adjusted for full coverage in the case of a joint coverage member who makes the appropriate back contributions for full coverage, shall be frozen as of the date such annuity ceases. An annuitant who is credited with an additional 10% of Class A and Class C service as provided in section 5302(c) (relating to credited State service) and who returns to State service shall forfeit such credited service and shall have his frozen present value adjusted as if his 10% retirement incentive had not been applied to his account. In the event that the cost-of-living increase enacted December 18, 1979 occurred during the period of such State or school employment, the frozen present value shall be increased, on or after the member attains superannuation age, by the percent applicable had he not returned to service. (2) This subsection shall not apply in the case of any annuitant who: (i) may render services to the Commonwealth in the capacity of an independent contractor; or (ii) is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year and who may render service to the Commonwealth: (A) as a member of an independent board or commission or as a member of a departmental administrative or advisory board or commission when such members of independent or departmental boards or commissions are compensated on a per diem basis for not more than 150 days per calendar year; or (B) as a member of an independent board or commission requiring appointment by the Governor, with advice and consent of the Senate, where the annual salary payable to the member does not exceed $35,000 and where the member has been an annuitant for at least six months immediately preceding the appointment. (a.1) Return to State service during emergency.-- When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public, an annuitant who is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year may be returned to State service for a period not to exceed 95 days in any calendar year without loss of his annuity. In computing the number of days an annuitant has returned to State service, any amount of time less than one-half of a day shall be counted as one-half of a day. For agencies, boards and commissions under the Governor's jurisdiction, the approval of the Governor that an emergency exists shall be required before an annuitant may be returned to State service. (a.2) Return of benefits.-- In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 5705 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to State service or entering school service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member or school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid. (a.3) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.-- In the event that a former State employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount so received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board, but not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave, with the repayment period not to exceed five years or such longer time as may be agreed to between the board and the member. (a.4) Return to service as a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of the act of September 30, 1983 (P.L.160, No.39), known as the Public Official Compensation Law, 42 Pa.C.S. (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure) or any other provision of law or rule of court providing for or allowing a member of the judiciary to return to service as a senior judge, senior justice, senior magisterial district judge or in any administrative, fact finding, adjudicative, appellate or other capacity with any court or tribunal or in any other capacity for which compensation is received and to receive such compensation, whether paid on a per diem, hourly, salaried or other basis, in addition to any annuity payable under this part, any such member of the judiciary who returns to State service shall be subject to the provision of this section and section 5301 (relating to mandatory and optional membership) unless that member of the judiciary is over normal retirement age or has been an annuitant for more than one year. (a.5) No contributions or credited service.-- The service of an annuitant whose annuity does not cease upon his return to State or school service shall not be subject to member contributions or eligible for qualification as creditable State service and shall not be eligible for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions, voluntary contributions or employer defined contributions. (b) Subsequent discontinuance of service.-- Upon subsequent discontinuance of service, such terminating State employee other than a former annuitant who had the effect of his frozen present value eliminated in accordance with subsection (c) or a former disability annuitant shall be entitled to an annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the present value as determined under subsection (a) to which shall be added, if the service after reemployment was as a member of the system, the present value of a maximum single life annuity based on years of service credited subsequent to reentry in the system and his final average salary computed by reference to his compensation as a member of the system or as a member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System during his entire period of State and school service. (c) Elimination of the effect of frozen present value.-- (1) An annuitant who returns to State service as an active member of the system and earns three eligibility points as a member of the system by performing credited State service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, or an annuitant who enters school service other than as a Class DC participant and: (i) is a multiple service member; or (ii) who elects multiple service membership, and earns three eligibility points by performing credited State service as a member of the system or credited school service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, and who had the present value of his annuity frozen in accordance with subsection (a), shall qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value resulting from all previous periods of retirement eliminated, provided that all lump sum payments under Option 4 or under section 5705(a.1) and annuity payments payable during previous periods of retirement plus interest as set forth in paragraph (3) shall be returned to the fund in the form of an actuarial adjustment to his subsequent benefits or in such form as the board may otherwise direct. (2) Upon subsequent discontinuance of service and the filing of an application for an annuity, a former annuitant who qualifies to have the effect of a frozen present value eliminated under this subsection shall be entitled to receive the higher of either: (i) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the freezing of the former annuitant's account pursuant to subsection (a) had not occurred, adjusted by crediting Class A State service as Class AA service as provided for in section 5306(a.1) (relating to classes of service) and further adjusted according to paragraph (3), provided that a former annuitant of the system or a former annuitant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System who retired under a provision of law granting additional service credit if termination of State or school service or retirement occurred during a specific period of time shall not be permitted to retain the additional service credit under the prior law when the annuity is computed for his most recent retirement; or (ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value eliminated, unless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity. (3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement. The interest for each year shall be calculated based upon the annual interest rate adopted for that fiscal year by the board for the calculation of the normal contribution rate pursuant to section 5508(b) (relating to actuarial cost method).

(b) Licensing rights.-- A certificate of public convenience is a licensing right which accompanies each medallion and authorizes the operation of one taxicab within a city of the first class. No property interest shall exist in the certificate itself. A certificate may not be pledged to lenders or creditors as security on debt. A certificate may be canceled by the authority, upon due cause shown, for violation of this subchapter or authority regulations. If the authority cancels a certificate, the certificate holder shall have the right to sell the accompanying medallion within six months of the date of cancellation, and the certificate holder must turn the medallion over to the authority office within five days of cancellation of the certificate for safekeeping until the medallion is sold. This six-month time period shall be extended during the pendency of a petition for reinstatement of the certificate of public convenience. If the medallion is not sold within the statutory period, the medallion will become nontransferable, and possession must be surrendered to the authority.

(a) Vehicles generally.-- (1) A vehicle may not be operated as a taxicab with citywide call or demand rights in cities of the first class unless a certificate of public convenience is issued by the authority authorizing the operation of the taxicab and a medallion is attached to the hood of the vehicle. Prior to the issuance of a medallion, the certificate holder shall have its vehicle inspected by the authority. (2) The authority shall require, by order or regulation, that each vehicle within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter submit to periodic inspections by authority personnel to ensure that the vehicle meets the requirements of this subchapter and authority regulations. (3) Authority inspection requirements for vehicles within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to the vehicle requirements set forth in Title 75 (relating to vehicles) and may include vehicle age and mileage limitations. Authority inspection and recording requirements shall be established by regulations. (4) No vehicle which is more than eight years old shall continue in operation as a taxicab. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority may authorize the operation of antique vehicles in call or demand service in such circumstances as the authority may deem appropriate. (5) Each taxicab certificate holder's tariff rates shall be clearly and visibly displayed in each taxicab. (6) A medallion shall not be removed from a vehicle without prior notification to and permission of the authority.

(b) Driver security devices.-- Each vehicle authorized to provide taxicab service shall be equipped with such security devices as the authority may, in its discretion, require by order or regulation. (c) Service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon call or demand and parcels, packages and property at the same basic metered rates charged to passengers: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its centralized dispatch system; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as a continuous part of a trip. (d) Other vehicles.-- (1) A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission authorizing call or demand service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and property: (i) to cities of the first class in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (ii) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond that city of the first class if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its radio dispatch service.

The authority shall not grant additional rights to new or existing carriers to serve designated areas within cities of the first class on a non-citywide basis. (e) Penalties involving certificated taxicabs.-- Operating a certificated taxicab in violation of subsections (a) and (b) or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders of subsections (a) and (b) may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725 (relating to civil penalties). (f) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a taxicab, or giving the appearance of offering call or demand service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience and a medallion is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each offense thereafter. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as or appearing as a taxicab without a certificate of public convenience and a medallion are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (g) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) The authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles, medallions and equipment which are utilized to provide call or demand service in cities of the first class without a proper certificate of public convenience issued by the authority or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and payment of the costs of the authority associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle, medallion and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction. (ii) To all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner and operator of the confiscated property.

(b) Joint airport zoning board.-- Where any airport hazard area appertaining to an airport is located outside the territorial limits of the municipality encompassing the airport, all of the municipalities involved may, by ordinance or resolution, create a joint airport zoning board which shall have the same power to adopt, administer and enforce airport zoning regulations applicable to the airport hazard area in question as that vested by subsection (a) in the municipality within which the area is located. Each joint airport zoning board shall have as members two representatives appointed by each municipality participating in its creation and, in addition, a chairman elected by a majority of the members so appointed.

However, all regulations shall provide that before any nonconforming structure may be replaced, substantially altered or rebuilt or tree allowed to grow higher or replanted, a permit must be secured from the municipality authorizing the replacement or change.

(b) Variance.-- Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth of any object of natural growth or otherwise use his property in violation of airport zoning regulations may apply to the board for a variance from the zoning regulations in question. A variance shall only be granted after the requirements of section 5919 (relating to notice to department) are satisfied. A variance may be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but would do substantial justice and would be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this subchapter.

(c) Hazard marking and lighting.-- In granting any permit or variance under this section, the board shall, if it deems the action advisable to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter and reasonable in the circumstances, so condition the permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person or persons requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be required by guidelines or regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States Department of Transportation.

(2) Unemployment, the spread of indigency and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. (3) Development and continuation of a major convention center is most appropriate in a city of the first class which, because of size, is capable of attracting major national conventions, and the attraction of business to this Commonwealth as a result of the development and continuation is an important factor in the continual encouragement, promotion, attraction, stimulation, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within a city of the first class, its surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (4) The purpose of a convention center should be the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in a city of the first class, its surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (5) The development and continuation of a convention center will provide benefits to the hotel industry throughout the entire region where the convention center is developed. (6) The development and continuation of a convention center will also provide benefits to the restaurant and entertainment industries throughout the entire region where the convention center is located, to all other businesses and individuals benefited by the attraction of major conventions and tourists, to other individual businesses whose livelihood is dependent on the attraction of major conventions and tourists and to the general public. (7) The need for and promotion of the type of facility which provides and will continue to provide significant benefits to the general public will require the expenditure of public money, and it is appropriate to authorize a city of the first class where the convention center is located to impose and collect a tax or continue to impose and collect a tax, applicable within the entire territorial limits of the city, to facilitate the development or continuation of a convention center and the promotion of tourism within the city of the first class and the region. (8) To promote the development and continuation of a convention center within this Commonwealth, it is necessary to provide additional and flexible means of developing, constructing, designing, managing, financing and operating such a convention center. (9) An important aspect of the development and continuation of a convention center should be the removal of blighted areas and the redevelopment of blighted areas. (10) The policy of this Commonwealth is to promote the health, safety, employment, business opportunities and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing for the creation and continuation of a convention center authority, which shall exist and operate as a public instrumentality of this Commonwealth for the public purpose of promoting, attracting, stimulating, developing and expanding business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth.

In the case of both the capital and operating budgets and change orders of the authority, approval shall be presumed unless the chief financial officer of the city has disapproved the entire operating budget or relevant amendments to it or either the chief financial officer of the city or the Secretary of the Budget has disapproved all or part of the capital budget of the authority or amendments to it or change orders within 30 days of the receipt of the respective budgets, amendments to the respective budgets or change orders.

(d) Project design.-- Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the design for any capital project undertaken by the authority shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Budget and the chief financial officer of the city for approval. No capital project may be undertaken by the authority unless the schematic design and the preliminary design development documents have been approved by the Secretary of the Budget and the chief financial officer of the city. The design and construction of any capital project for the convention center may be divided into stages or phases for which schematic design and preliminary design development documents may be approved separately by the Secretary of the Budget and the chief financial officer of the city and which may be undertaken by the authority as if each stage or phase was a separate capital project. In the case of the schematic design and preliminary design development documents for any capital project or any stage or phase of a capital project, approval shall be presumed unless the Secretary of the Budget or the chief financial officer of the city has disapproved the design and expressly set forth his objections to the documents within 45 days of the receipt of the documents. Further design approval shall not be required provided the construction documents are consistent with the design set forth in the schematic and preliminary design development documents. (e) Onsite inspectors.-- The Secretary of the Budget may appoint and designate an inspector or inspectors who shall have complete authority to inspect any and all aspects of the construction of any capital project undertaken by the authority.

(a) Lowest responsible bidder.-- All construction, reconstruction, repairs or work of any nature made by the authority where the entire cost, value or amount of construction, reconstruction, repairs or work, including labor and materials, shall exceed $25,000, except construction, reconstruction, repairs or work done by employees of the authority or by labor supplied under agreement with any Federal agency, State public body, political subdivision or city with supplies and materials purchased as provided in this chapter, shall be done only under contract or contracts to be entered into by the authority with the lowest responsible bidder upon proper terms, after due public notice has been given asking for competitive bids as provided in this chapter, but the authority shall have the right to reject any or all bids or select a single item from any bid. No contract shall be entered into for construction or improvement or repair of any project or portion of a project unless the contractor shall provide sufficient surety or sureties approved by the authority, and in an amount fixed by the authority, for the performance of the contract. All contracts shall provide, among other things, that the person or corporation entering into the contract with the authority will pay for all materials furnished and services rendered for the performance of the contract and that any person or corporation furnishing materials or rendering services may maintain an action to recover for the same against the obligor in the undertaking as though the person or corporation was named in the undertaking, provided the action is brought within one year after the time the cause of action accrued. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the power of the authority to construct, repair or improve any project or portion of a project or any addition, betterment or extension to a project, directly by the officers and employees of the authority. Whether the costs of the project are being paid for in whole or in part with funds provided under section 6015 (relating to transfer of existing facilities or funds; making of annual grants and lease payments to authority; Commonwealth bonds), the authority may award the construction, expansion or substantial renovation of a convention center as a single bid project without regard to the provisions of the act of May 1, 1913 (P.L.155, No.104), entitled \"An act regulating the letting of certain contracts for the erection, construction, and alteration of public buildings,\" and shall not be subject to 62 Pa.C.S. (relating to procurement). Nothing in this section or any other law of this Commonwealth shall require the authority to competitively bid architectural design, engineering, construction management or other professional services required by the authority. (b) Supplies and materials.-- All supplies and materials costing $25,000 or more to be acquired directly by the authority shall be purchased only after due advertisement as provided in this chapter. The authority shall accept the lowest bid or bids from a responsible bidder, kind, quality and material being equal, but the authority shall have the right to reject any or all bids or select a single item from any bid. The provisions as to bidding shall not apply to the purchase of unique supplies and materials or supplies and materials which cannot be obtained in the open market. (c) Management prerogatives.-- Nothing in this section or in any other law of the Commonwealth shall preclude the board, with the approval of eight members of the board, from negotiating contracts for management, operation, concession services, licensing or leasing of a convention center or any part of a convention center. The authority shall not award any contract to any manager, operator, concessionaire, licensee, lessee or lessor that exceeds three years in duration unless eight members of the board approve the awarding of a contract for a greater period of time. (d) Application of city ordinances.-- The authority, its contractors, subcontractors, assignees, lessees, agents, vendors and suppliers shall not be subject to any city laws, ordinances, rules or regulations relating to any limits or preferences with regard to employment, contracting or procurement in the construction and operation of the convention center. (e) Steel products.-- The authority shall be subject to the act of March 3, 1978 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Steel Products Procurement Act, and 62 Pa.C.S. Ch. 37 Subch. B (relating to motor vehicles). (f) Waiver of notice.-- Public notice under this section may be waived if the authority determines an emergency exists and the supplies and materials must be purchased immediately by the authority.

      "text": "§ 7102. Interstate Corrections Compact. The Interstate Corrections Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this State with any other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: INTERSTATE CORRECTIONS COMPACT ARTICLE I Purpose and Policy The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had. (c) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had. (d) \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution. (e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including, but not limited to, a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined. ARTICLE III Contracts (a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration. 2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance. 3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any, the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom. 4. Delivery and retaking of inmates. 5. Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states. (b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith. ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights (a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. (b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. (c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III. (d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state. (e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state. (f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. (g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory. (h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state. (i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact. ARTICLE V Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition (a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference. (b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VI Federal Aid Any state party to this compact may accept Federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such Federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provisions, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor. ARTICLE VII Entry into Force This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state. ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact. ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements. ARTICLE X Construction and Severability The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",

(b) Maximum rates of interest.-- No obligation or liability bearing interest at a rate in excess of the rate established under section 206 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 1178, 50 U.S.C. App. § 526), as may be amended from time to time, incurred by a person in military service, as described in subsection (a), shall, during any part of the period of service which occurs after the enactment of this section, bear interest at a rate in excess of the rate under section 206, calculated as an annual percentage rate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, unless, in the opinion of the court, upon application thereto by the obligee, the ability of the person in the military service to pay interest upon the obligation or liability at a rate in excess of the rate under section 206 is not materially affected by reason of service, in which case the court may make the order as in its opinion may be just. (c) Recalculation of repayment schedule.-- Upon the reduction of the annual rate of interest pursuant to this section, there shall be a corresponding and proportionate reduction of the amount of any periodic payments made to satisfy the obligation based on a recalculation of the repayment schedule with the same repayment frequency and an interest rate equal to the rate established under section 206 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, amortized over the original term of the loan. (d) Rescheduling of debt payments.-- When a member's income is materially reduced as a result of his being called or ordered to active duty, the member, his spouse or his agent or attorney-in-fact may apply to his creditors for a rescheduling of his debt payments to take into account the material reduction in his income. The member, his spouse or his agent or attorney-in-fact shall provide the creditor with a statement of his income prior to being called or ordered to active duty and his income thereafter.

      "text": "§ 8703. Adoption of referendum. (a) General rule.-- (1) In order to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter, a governing body shall use the procedures set forth in subsection (b). (2) Any governing body after making an election to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter may, after a period of at least three full fiscal years, elect under the provisions of subsection (c) to levy, assess and collect the taxes prohibited by section 8701(b) (relating to general tax authorization) to the extent otherwise provided by law. If the electorate approves such referendum, the governing body shall lose the authority to continue to levy an earned income and net profits tax authorized under this chapter. (b) Public referendum requirements.-- Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements of section 8716 (relating to procedure and administration), a governing body may levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter only by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at only the municipal election preceding the fiscal year when the earned income and net profits tax will be initially imposed. The referendum question must state the initial rate of the proposed earned income and net profits tax, the reason for the tax and the amount of proposed budgeted revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum, expressed as a percent increase over the prior year's budgeted revenue. Any increase in budgeted revenue between the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum and the prior year's budgeted revenue shall not exceed the annual percent change in the Statewide average weekly wage. The question shall be in clear language that is readily understandable by a layperson. For the purpose of illustration, a referendum question may be framed as follows: Do you favor the imposition of an earned income and net profits tax of X% to be used to replace (names of local taxes to be repealed), reduce real property taxes by X% by means of a homestead exclusion and provide for a one-time revenue increase of X% over the preceding fiscal year? A nonlegal interpretative statement must accompany the question in accordance with section 201.1 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code, that includes the following: the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax and the maximum allowable rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the estimated revenues to be derived from the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the amount of proposed revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum; the estimated reduction in real property taxes and the elimination of certain existing taxes under this chapter; the identification of the existing taxes to be eliminated under this chapter; the method to be used to reduce real property taxes; the class or classes of real property for which real property taxes would be reduced; and the estimated amount of real property tax reduction by class, expressed as an average percent reduction by class. Any governing body which uses the procedures under this section shall not be subject to the provisions of section 8704 (relating to public referendum requirements for increasing property taxes previously reduced) for any future increases in the earned income and net profits tax rates authorized under this chapter. Any future real property tax rate increases are subject to the provisions of section 8704. If the ballot question fails to receive a majority vote pursuant to this section, approval of the electorate under section 8704 shall not be required to increase the rate of any tax which the governing body of the affected school district is authorized to levy and increase pursuant to any other act. (c) Public referendum requirements to end participation under this chapter.-- Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements in section 4 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, a governing body may elect to end participation under this chapter in accordance with subsection (a)(2) by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at a municipal election. (d) Public requirements to initiate referendum.-- (1) If the governing body of a school district fails to place a referendum question on the ballot within two years after the effective date of this chapter, the electors of the school district may: (i) Circulate a petition which, if signed by electors comprising 2% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with the election officials and submitted to the governing body thereof, shall require the governing body to establish a local tax study commission. The provisions under paragraph (2)(v), (vi), (vii), (viii) (ix) and (x) shall not apply to this subparagraph. (ii) If the local tax study commission makes a recommendation to levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter and the governing body fails to place the recommendation or other alternative of the governing body authorized under this chapter on the ballot in accordance with this chapter at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the submission of the recommendation to the governing body, a petition under this paragraph may be circulated. If the petition is signed by the electors comprising 5% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with election officials at least 90 days prior to the next municipal election, the petition shall compel the election officials to place the recommendation upon the ballot at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the filing of the petition. (2) The following requirements shall apply to the process under paragraph (1): (i) The name and street address of each elector signing the petition and of the person filing the petition shall be clearly stated on the petition. The petition shall include an affidavit of the circulator that he or she is a qualified elector of the school district referred to in the petition; that the signers signed with full knowledge of the contents of the petition; that the signers' residences are correctly stated; and that, to the best of the circulator's knowledge and belief, the signers are qualified electors. (ii) The election officials shall, within ten days after filing, review the petition as to the number and qualifications of signers. If the petition appears to be defective, the election officials shall immediately notify the person filing the petition of the defect and may reject the petition if warranted. (iii) The petition as submitted to the election officials, along with the list of signatories, shall be open to public inspection in the office of the election officials. (iv) If the election officials find that the petition as submitted is in proper order, they shall send copies of the petition without signatures thereon to the governing body involved. (v) The procedure for the referendum shall be governed by the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code. (vi) If the election officials find the petition meets the requirements of this chapter, they shall place the proposal on the ballot in a manner fairly representing the content of the petition for decision by referendum at the proper election. (vii) The election officials shall certify the date for the referendum and shall notify the governing body at least 30 days prior to such date. (viii) At least 30 days' notice of the referendum shall be given by proclamation of the governing body. A copy of the proclamation shall be posted at each polling place on the day of the election and shall be published once in at least one newspaper of general circulation which is distributed within the school district during the 30-day period prior to the election. (ix) Approval of a referendum shall be by majority vote of those voting in the school district involved. (x) The election officials shall certify the results of the referendum to the governing body. (e) School districts located in more than one county.-- (1) In the event a school district is located in more than one county, petitions under this section shall be filed with the election officials of the county wherein the administrative offices of the school district are located. (2) The election officials receiving a petition shall be responsible for all administrative functions in reviewing and certifying the validity of the petition and for making all necessary communications with the school district. (3) If the election officials of the county receiving the petition certify that it is sufficient under this subpart and determine that a question should be placed upon the ballot, such decision shall be communicated to election officials in any other county in which the school district is also located. Election officials in the other county or counties shall cooperate with election officials of the county receiving the petition to insure that an identical question is placed on the ballot at the same election throughout the entire school district. (4) Election officials from each county involved shall independently certify the results from their county to the governing body. Cross References.

(a) Findings.-- The General Assembly hereby finds that imposition of a tax on oil company revenues should provide the Department of Transportation with an annual growth in revenues which offsets the growth in highway maintenance and construction costs more effectively than the annual changes in revenues produced by the flat-rate tax on the retail price of gasoline and by the various other taxes and fees levied on behalf of the department. As a result of such a tax on oil company revenues, the Department of Transportation should have sufficient revenues to carry out necessary maintenance and construction activities with less frequent increases in highway taxes and fees than the General Assembly has enacted in recent years. One effect of less frequent requests for highway tax and fee increases could be a significant decrease in the ability of the General Assembly to oversee the activities of the Department of Transportation. Accordingly, the General Assembly finds that responsible legislative oversight requires ongoing monitoring of the department's activities and periodic indepth evaluations of its performance. (b) Annual reports.-- No later than 30 days after the effective date of this section, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the 1981-1982 fiscal year. No later than 30 days before the beginning of the 1982-1983 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the upcoming fiscal year. No later than 30 days after the end of the 1981-1982 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the reasons for any major deviations from the maintenance and construction program which had been planned for that member's district during that fiscal year. (c) Performance audits.-- During the 1983-1984 fiscal year, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, a performance audit of the department carried out in accordance with the standards for performance and financial compliance auditing developed by the United States General Accounting Office. The performance audit shall determine whether the department is conducting authorized activities or programs in a manner consistent with accomplishing the objectives intended by the General Assembly and is conducting programs or activities and expending available funds in a faithful, efficient, economical and effective manner. The Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall make a written report of the findings of the performance audit and shall submit a copy of that report to each member of the House of Representatives and each member of the Senate prior to enactment of a maintenance and construction budget for the department for the 1984-1985 fiscal year. During the 1989-1990 fiscal year and every six years thereafter, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, a performance audit of the department similar to the performance audit required by this subsection to be conducted during the 1983-1984 fiscal year.",

(a) Applicability of section.-- If the declaration for a condominium provides that any of the powers described in section 3302 (relating to powers of unit owners' association) with respect to the condominium are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association (a \"master association\") which exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more other condominiums or other incorporated or unincorporated associations, then, except as modified by this section, all provisions of this subpart applicable to unit owners' associations shall apply to any such master association insofar as its actions affect the condominium. (b) Powers.-- Unless a master association is acting in the capacity of an association described in section 3301 (relating to organization of unit owners' association) with respect to a condominium which is part of the master association, it may exercise with respect to the condominium only such powers set forth in section 3302 and only to the extent expressly permitted in the declaration of condominium which provides for the delegation of powers from its condominium association to the master association and accepted by such master association as indicated in the provisions of the declaration or other organizational documents of such master association. (c) Liability of executive board members and officers.-- If the declaration of a condominium provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board have no liability for the acts or omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following such delegation. The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the condominium association whose powers are delegated thereto and the unit owners of such condominium on the same basis as officers and executive board members of such condominium immediately before such delegation of powers. (d) Rights and responsibilities of persons electing governing body.-- The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in sections 3303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 3308 (relating to meetings), 3309 (relating to quorums), 3310 (relating to voting; proxies) and 3320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association with respect to the exercise of powers delegated pursuant to a condominium declaration to such master association, but apply only to those persons who elect the governing body of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this subpart. (e) Election of master association governing body.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3303(e) with respect to the election of the executive board by all unit owners after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 3301, the instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each condominium or the organizational documents of other associations the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association shall provide that the governing body of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways: (1) All unit owners of all condominiums and other properties subject to the master association elect all members of the governing body of the master association. (2) All members of the governing bodies of the condominium associations and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect all members of the master association governing body. (3) All unit owners of each condominium and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (4) All members of the governing bodies of the condominiums and other property associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (f) Delegation of responsibility and authority.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to a condominium if and when: (1) there occurs either a date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the condominium; (2) there occurs an event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable, and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that: (i) such event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the condominium; and (ii) that a copy of such instrument has been sent to all unit owners; or (3) the declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the condominium and that a copy of such instrument has been sent to the executive board and all unit owners. Paragraph (3) shall be applicable only if the declarant shall have expressly reserved in the declaration, pursuant to section 3205(12) (relating to contents of declaration; all condominiums), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the condominium and only if the instrument exercising such right shall have been recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right. (g) Delegation of all powers.-- If all the powers of a condominium association are delegated to a master association and accepted by such master association pursuant to subsection (b), then the governing body of the master association may act in all respects as the executive board of the condominium and no separate executive board need be elected or exist.

      "text": "§ 3225. Bonding. (a) General rule.-- The following shall apply: (1) Except as provided in subsection (d), upon filing an application for a well permit and before continuing to operate an oil or gas well, the owner or operator of the well shall file with the department a bond covering the well and well site on a form to be prescribed and furnished by the department. A bond filed with an application for a well permit shall be payable to the Commonwealth and conditioned upon the operator's faithful performance of all drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. A bond for a well in existence on April 18, 1985, shall be payable to the Commonwealth and conditioned upon the operator's faithful performance of all water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The amount of the bond required shall be in the following amounts and amounts under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) may be adjusted by the Environmental Quality Board every two years to reflect the projected costs to the Commonwealth of plugging the well: (i) For unconventional wells with a total well bore length less than 6,000 feet: (A) For operating up to 50 wells, $4,000 per well, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $35,000. (B) For operating 51 to 150 wells, $35,000 plus $4,000 per well for each well in excess of 50 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $60,000. (C) For operating 151 to 250 wells, $60,000 plus $4,000 per well for each well in excess of 150 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $100,000. (D) For operating more than 250 wells, $100,000 plus $4,000 per well for each well in excess of 250 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $250,000. (ii) For unconventional wells with a total well bore length of at least 6,000 feet: (A) For operating up to 25 wells, $10,000 per well, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $140,000. (B) For operating 26 to 50 wells, $140,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 25 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $290,000. (C) For operating 51 to 150 wells, $290,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 50 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $430,000. (D) For operating more than 150 wells, $430,000 plus $10,000 per well for each well in excess of 150 wells, but no bond may be required under this clause in excess of $600,000. (iii) For a well other than an unconventional well, $2,500 per well. For 10 years following the effective date of this subparagraph, the Environmental Quality Board and the department shall have no authority to adjust the amount under this subparagraph. (2) The following apply: (i) Except as provided under subparagraph (ii), in lieu of individual bonds for each well, an owner or operator may file a blanket bond for the applicable amount under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii), on a form prepared by the department, covering all of its wells in this Commonwealth, as enumerated on the bond form. (ii) As follows: (A) An operator may file a blanket bond of $25,000 for all of the operator's wells in this Commonwealth that are not unconventional wells. (B) For every new well that is not an unconventional well drilled after six months after the effective date of this subsection, the bond amount for that operator shall increase by $1,000. (C) The total blanket bond for an operator's wells that are not unconventional wells shall not exceed $100,000. (D) The blanket bond increase of $1,000 shall be waived by the department for a new well drilled under this subsection if the operator provides evidence to the department that the operator has plugged an orphan well at the operator's own expense for which the operator was not the responsible party within the previous 365 days that the operator has not yet received credit for under this subsection by the department. (E) For 10 years following the effective date of this clause, the bond amounts for wells that are not unconventional wells may only be revised by the General Assembly. The Environmental Quality Board and the department shall have no authority to adjust bond amounts related to wells that are not unconventional wells during that time period. (2.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, section 1934-A of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929, shall continue to apply to a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985. (3) Liability under the bond shall continue until the well has been properly plugged in accordance with this chapter and for a period of one year after filing of the certificate of plugging with the department. Each bond shall be executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do business in this Commonwealth and approved by the secretary. In lieu of a corporate surety, the operator may deposit with the department: (i) cash; (ii) certificates of deposit or automatically renewable irrevocable letters of credit, from financial institutions chartered or authorized to do business in this Commonwealth and regulated and examined by the Commonwealth or a Federal agency, which may be terminated at the end of a term only upon 90 days' prior written notice by the financial institution to the permittee and the department; (iii) negotiable bonds of the United States Government or the Commonwealth, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, the General State Authority, the State Public School Building Authority or any municipality within the Commonwealth; or (iv) United States Treasury Bonds issued at a discount without a regular schedule of interest payments to maturity, otherwise known as Zero Coupon Bonds, having a maturity date of not more than ten years after the date of purchase and at the maturity date having a value of not less than the applicable amount under paragraph (1). The cash deposit, certificate of deposit, amount of the irrevocable letter of credit or market value of the securities shall be equal at least to the sum of the bond. (4) The secretary shall, upon receipt of a deposit of cash, letters of credit or negotiable bonds, immediately place the same with the State Treasurer, whose duty it shall be to receive and hold the same in the name of the Commonwealth, in trust, for the purpose for which the deposit is made. (5) The State Treasurer shall at all times be responsible for custody and safekeeping of deposits. The operator making the deposit shall be entitled from time to time to demand and receive from the State Treasurer, on the written order of the secretary, the whole or any portion of collateral deposited, upon depositing with the State Treasurer, in lieu of that collateral, other collateral of classes specified in this section having a market value at least equal to the sum of the bond, and also to demand, receive and recover the interest and income from the negotiable bonds as they become due and payable. (6) If negotiable bonds on deposit under this subsection mature or are called, the State Treasurer, at the request of the owner of the bonds, shall convert them into other negotiable bonds, of classes specified in this section, designated by the owner. (7) If notice of intent to terminate a letter of credit is given, the department shall give the operator 30 days' written notice to replace the letter of credit with other acceptable bond guarantees as provided in this section. If the owner or operator fails to timely replace the letter of credit, the department shall draw upon and convert the letter of credit into cash and hold it as a collateral bond guarantee. (b) Release.-- No bond shall be fully released until the requirements of subsection (a) and section 3223 (relating to notification and effect of well transfer) have been fully met. Upon release of bonds and collateral under this section, the State Treasurer shall immediately return to the owner the specified amount of cash or securities. (c) Noncompliance.-- If a well owner or operator fails or refuses to comply with subsection (a), regulations promulgated under this chapter or conditions of a permit relating to this chapter, the department may declare the bond forfeited and shall certify the same to the Attorney General, who shall proceed to enforce and collect the full amount of the bond and, if the well owner or operator has deposited cash or securities as collateral in lieu of a corporate surety, the department shall declare the collateral forfeited and direct the State Treasurer to pay the full amount of the funds into the Well Plugging Restricted Revenue Account or to sell the security to the extent forfeited and pay the proceeds into the Well Plugging Restricted Revenue Account. If a corporate surety or financial institution fails to pay a forfeited bond promptly and in full, the corporate surety or financial institution shall be disqualified from writing further bonds under this chapter or any other environmental law administered by the department. A person aggrieved by reason of forfeiting the bond or converting collateral, as provided in this section, shall have a right to appeal to the Environmental Hearing Board in the manner provided by law. Upon forfeiture of a blanket bond for a violation occurring at one or more well sites, the person whose bond is forfeited shall, within ten days of the forfeiture, submit a replacement bond to cover all other wells of which the person is an owner or operator. Failure to submit the replacement bond constitutes a violation of this section as to each of the wells owned or operated by the person. (d) Alternatives to certain bonds.-- The following shall apply: (1) An operator of not more than 200 wells who cannot obtain a bond for a well drilled prior to April 18, 1985, as required under subsection (a), due to inability to demonstrate sufficient financial resources may, in lieu of the bond: (i) Submit to the department a fee in the amount of $50 per well, a blanket fee of $500 for ten to 20 wells or a blanket fee of $1,000 for more than 20 wells, which shall be a nonrefundable fee paid each year that the operator has not filed a bond with the department. All fees collected in lieu of a bond under this subsection shall be used for the purposes authorized by this chapter. The Environmental Quality Board shall have the power, by regulation, to increase the amount of the fees established under this subsection. (ii) Make phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond, subject to the following: (A) Payment shall be based on the number of wells owned or operated. The operator shall make an initial deposit and make annual deposits in accordance with the schedule in clause (B). Interest accumulated by the collateral shall become a part of the bond until the collateral plus accumulated interest equals the amount of the required bond. The collateral shall be deposited, in trust, with the State Treasurer as provided in this subsection or with a bank selected by the department which shall act as trustee for the benefit of the Commonwealth to guarantee the operator's compliance with the drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The operator shall be required to pay all costs of the trust. (B) An operator of up to ten existing wells who does not intend to operate additional wells shall deposit $250 per well and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $50 per well until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 11 to 25 wells or an operator of up to ten wells who applies for one or more permits for additional wells shall deposit $2,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,150 plus $150 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 26 to 50 wells shall deposit $3,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,300 plus $400 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. An operator of 51 to 100 wells shall deposit $4,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,500 plus $400 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. Operators of 101 to 200 wells shall deposit $8,000 and shall, thereafter, annually deposit $1,600 plus $1,000 for each additional well to be permitted that year until the obligations of this section are fully met. Operators of more than 200 wells shall fully bond their wells immediately. (C) The department shall reduce the amount of phased collateral payments or the period of time over which phased collateral payments shall be made on behalf of owners or operators who, prior to August 1, 1992, have paid a fee in lieu of bond under subparagraph (i), and who, by August 1, 1993, choose to enter the phased collateral program under this subparagraph rather than continue to make payments in lieu of bond. Payments made prior to August 1, 1992, in lieu of bond shall not be credited in any other manner, and the department shall not be required to refund the fees. The Environmental Quality Board, by regulation, may change the annual deposits established under clause (B) if necessary to accommodate a change in the amount of the bond required under this section. (2) An operator may continue to pay a fee in lieu of bond or make phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond so long as the operator does not miss a payment under this subsection and remains in compliance with this chapter. If an operator misses a payment under this subsection, the operator shall: (i) immediately submit the appropriate bond amount in full; or (ii) cease all operations and plug all wells. (d.1) Individuals.-- The following shall apply: (1) An individual who is unable to obtain a bond to drill new wells due to inability to demonstrate financial resources may meet the collateral bond requirements of subsection (a) by making phased deposits of collateral to fully collateralize the bond. The individual shall be limited to drilling ten new wells per calendar year and, for each well to be drilled, deposit $500 and make an annual deposit of 10% of the remaining bond amount for a period of ten years. Interest accumulated shall become a part of the bond until the collateral plus accumulated interest equals the amount of the required bond. The collateral shall be deposited in trust with the State Treasurer under subsection (a) or with a bank selected by the department which shall act as trustee for the benefit of the Commonwealth to guarantee the individual's compliance with the drilling, water supply replacement, restoration and plugging requirements of this chapter. The individual shall pay all costs of the trust. (2) Individuals may continue to use phased collateral to obtain permits if they have not missed a payment for a well drilled under this provision and remain in compliance with this chapter. If an individual misses a payment, the individual shall: (i) immediately submit the appropriate bond amount in full; or (ii) cease all operations and plug all wells. (3) For purposes of this subsection, an \"individual\" means a natural person doing business under his own name. (e) Reservation of remedies.-- All remedies for violations of this chapter, regulations adopted under this chapter and conditions of permits are expressly preserved. Nothing in this section shall be construed as an exclusive penalty or remedy for violations of law. No action taken under this section shall waive or impair any other remedy or penalty provided in law. (f) Change of law.-- Owners or operators who have failed to meet the requirements of this section prior to August 1, 1992, shall not be required to make payments under this section on a retroactive basis as a condition of obtaining a permit under this chapter, nor shall the failure be deemed a violation of this chapter. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"well site\" means areas occupied by all equipment or facilities necessary for or incidental to drilling, production or plugging a well.

(a) Capital budget.-- At least 90 days before the commencing of the ensuing fiscal year of the authority, the board shall cause to be prepared and submitted to it a recommended capital budget. The capital budget shall show in detail the capital expenditures to be made or incurred in the next fiscal year which are to be financed from funds subject to control or appropriation by the board. The capital budget shall be prepared with the aid of the Secretary of the Budget and the chief financial officer of the city and shall be in a form and detail satisfactory to them. In the event that the capital budget is not in a form and detail satisfactory to either the Secretary of the Budget or the chief financial officer of the city, either official may require that the capital budget be redrafted and resubmitted. The official shall not be considered to be in receipt of the capital budget or any amendments to the capital budget unless the form and detail is to the officer's satisfaction. For each separate purpose, project, facility or other property, the amount and the source of the money which has been spent, encumbered or is intended to be spent or encumbered during the fiscal year shall be shown. No later than the date of the adoption of the annual operating budget, the board shall adopt a capital budget by a majority vote of its members. (b) Operating budget.-- At least 90 days before the commencing of the ensuing fiscal year of the authority, the board shall cause to be prepared and submitted to it a recommended operating budget. The operating budget shall be prepared with the aid of the chief financial officer of the city and shall be in form and detail satisfactory to him. In the event that the operating budget is not in a form and detail satisfactory to the chief financial officer of the city, the officer may require that the operating budget be redrafted and resubmitted. The chief financial officer shall not be considered to be in receipt of the operating budget or any amendments to the operating budget unless the form and detail is to the officer's satisfaction. The operating budget should set forth the estimated receipts and revenue of the authority during the next fiscal year. The board shall, at least 30 days before the end of the fiscal year, adopt, by a majority vote of its members, an operating budget for the next fiscal year. (c) Additional approvals or disapprovals.-- If the Secretary of the Budget or the chief financial officer of the city in which the convention center is located are among the members appointed to the board of the authority or if they sit as ex officio members of the board, each shall have the right to approve or disapprove each line item of the capital budget of the authority and any amendments to it as well as all change orders. In addition, the chief financial officer of the city shall have the right to approve or disapprove the total amount of the operating budget of the authority and any amendments increasing the aggregate amount. In the case of both the capital and operating budgets and change orders of the authority, approval shall be presumed unless the chief financial officer of the city has disapproved the entire operating budget or relevant amendments to it or either the chief financial officer of the city or the Secretary of the Budget has disapproved all or part of the capital budget of the authority or amendments to it or change orders within 30 days of the receipt of the respective budgets, amendments to the respective budgets or change orders. The Secretary of the Budget or the chief financial officer of the city may establish a threshold level below which the officers will not exercise their right to disapprove change orders and may identify categories or types of change orders for which they will not exercise that right. (d) Project design.-- Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the design for any capital project undertaken by the authority shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Budget and the chief financial officer of the city for approval. No capital project may be undertaken by the authority unless the schematic design and the preliminary design development documents have been approved by the Secretary of the Budget and the chief financial officer of the city. The design and construction of any capital project for the convention center may be divided into stages or phases for which schematic design and preliminary design development documents may be approved separately by the Secretary of the Budget and the chief financial officer of the city and which may be undertaken by the authority as if each stage or phase was a separate capital project. In the case of the schematic design and preliminary design development documents for any capital project or any stage or phase of a capital project, approval shall be presumed unless the Secretary of the Budget or the chief financial officer of the city has disapproved the design and expressly set forth his objections to the documents within 45 days of the receipt of the documents. Further design approval shall not be required provided the construction documents are consistent with the design set forth in the schematic and preliminary design development documents. (e) Onsite inspectors.-- The Secretary of the Budget may appoint and designate an inspector or inspectors who shall have complete authority to inspect any and all aspects of the construction of any capital project undertaken by the authority. Any inspection shall be made during normal business hours and shall be conducted in such a manner as to not disrupt the work of constructing the convention center and shall be made solely for the purpose of observing the construction of the project. The inspectors shall report to the Secretary of the Budget for the purpose of assisting the secretary in carrying out his duties and responsibilities as provided by this section.",

No contract shall be entered into for construction or improvement or repair of any project or portion of a project unless the contractor shall provide sufficient surety or sureties approved by the authority, and in an amount fixed by the authority, for the performance of the contract. All contracts shall provide, among other things, that the person or corporation entering into the contract with the authority will pay for all materials furnished and services rendered for the performance of the contract and that any person or corporation furnishing materials or rendering services may maintain an action to recover for the same against the obligor in the undertaking as though the person or corporation was named in the undertaking, provided the action is brought within one year after the time the cause of action accrued. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the power of the authority to construct, repair or improve any project or portion of a project or any addition, betterment or extension to a project, directly by the officers and employees of the authority. Whether the costs of the project are being paid for in whole or in part with funds provided under section 6015 (relating to transfer of existing facilities or funds; making of annual grants and lease payments to authority; Commonwealth bonds), the authority may award the construction, expansion or substantial renovation of a convention center as a single bid project without regard to the provisions of the act of May 1, 1913 (P.L.155, No.104), entitled \"An act regulating the letting of certain contracts for the erection, construction, and alteration of public buildings,\" and shall not be subject to 62 Pa.C.S.

(b) Supplies and materials.-- All supplies and materials costing $25,000 or more to be acquired directly by the authority shall be purchased only after due advertisement as provided in this chapter. The authority shall accept the lowest bid or bids from a responsible bidder, kind, quality and material being equal, but the authority shall have the right to reject any or all bids or select a single item from any bid. The provisions as to bidding shall not apply to the purchase of unique supplies and materials or supplies and materials which cannot be obtained in the open market. (c) Management prerogatives.-- Nothing in this section or in any other law of the Commonwealth shall preclude the board, with the approval of eight members of the board, from negotiating contracts for management, operation, concession services, licensing or leasing of a convention center or any part of a convention center. The authority shall not award any contract to any manager, operator, concessionaire, licensee, lessee or lessor that exceeds three years in duration unless eight members of the board approve the awarding of a contract for a greater period of time. (d) Application of city ordinances.-- The authority, its contractors, subcontractors, assignees, lessees, agents, vendors and suppliers shall not be subject to any city laws, ordinances, rules or regulations relating to any limits or preferences with regard to employment, contracting or procurement in the construction and operation of the convention center. (e) Steel products.-- The authority shall be subject to the act of March 3, 1978 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Steel Products Procurement Act, and 62 Pa.C.S. Ch. 37 Subch.
