      "text": "(a) Mental incapacity generally.--When the accused is determined under this part to be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent such that he is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of the case, the general court-martial convening authority for the accused shall commit him to the custody of an agency or facility providing services to persons with such a disease or defect.\n\n(b) Agency or facility action.--The agency or facility providing services shall take action in accordance with the jurisdictional laws applicable to persons incompetent to stand trial. If, at the end of the period for hospitalization, it is determined that the accused's mental condition has not so improved as to permit the trial to proceed, action shall be taken in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction.\n\n(c) Recovery of accused.--When the director of a facility in which the accused is hospitalized determines that the accused has recovered to such an extent that he is able to understand the nature of the proceedings against him and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of the case, the director shall promptly transmit a notification of that determination to the general court-martial convening authority for the accused. The director shall send a copy of the notification to the defense counsel for the accused.\n\n(d) Receipt of notification of competence.--Upon receipt of a notification transmitted under subsection (c), the general court-martial convening authority shall promptly take custody of the accused unless he is no longer subject to this part. If the accused is no longer subject to this part, the agency or facility with custody of the accused shall take such action as authorized by law of the jurisdiction. The director of the facility may retain custody of the accused for not more than 30 days after transmitting the notifications required under subsection (c).\n\n(e) Court ordering commitment.--In the application of jurisdictional law applicable to persons incompetent to stand trial, references to the court that ordered the commitment of a person and to the clerk of such court shall be deemed to refer to the general court-martial convening authority for the accused. However, if the accused is no longer subject to this part, the State trial court with felony jurisdiction in the county where the accused is hospitalized or otherwise may be found shall be considered as the court that ordered the commitment of the accused.",

      "text": "(a) Findings, sentences and challenges.--Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings and on the sentence shall be by secret written ballot. The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the president, who shall forthwith announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court.\n\n(b) Questions of law and interlocutory questions.--The military judge shall rule upon all questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. Any such ruling made by the military judge upon any question of law or any interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge may change the ruling at any time during the trial. Unless the ruling is final, if any member objects thereto, the court shall be cleared and closed and the question decided by a voice vote as provided in section 5717 (relating to number of votes required), beginning with the junior in rank.\n\n(c) Instructions to members of court.--Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge shall, in the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense and charge them:\n\n(1) that the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;\n\n(2) that, in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused and the accused shall be acquitted;\n\n(3) that, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt; and\n\n(4) that the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is upon the prosecution.\n\n(d) Proceedings before military judge only.--Subsections (a), (b) and (c) do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of such a court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence. The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and shall in addition, on request, find the facts specially. If an opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be sufficient if the findings of fact appear therein.",

If the record cannot be authenticated by the military judge by reason of his death, disability or absence, it shall be authenticated by the signature of the trial counsel or by that of a member if the trial counsel is unable to authenticate it by reason of his death, disability or absence. In a court-martial consisting of only a military judge, if the record cannot be authenticated by the military judge by reason of his death, disability or absence, the record shall be authenticated by the signature of the court reporter. A complete verbatim record of the proceedings and testimony shall be prepared in each general and special court-martial case resulting in a conviction. In all other court-martial cases, the record shall contain such matters as the Governor or department may by regulation prescribe.\n\n(b) Summary court martial.--Each summary court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case. The record shall be authenticated in such manner as the Governor or department may by regulation prescribe.\n\n(c) Furnishing record to accused.--A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as it is authenticated.",

      "text": "(a) General rule.--It shall be an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.\n\n(b) Burden of proof.--The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n(c) Instructions or findings by military judge.--Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge shall:\n\n(1) in a court-martial not composed of only a military judge, instruct the members of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this section and charge them to find the accused guilty, not guilty or not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility; or\n\n(2) in a court-martial composed of only a military judge, find the accused guilty, not guilty or not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.\n\n(d) Finding of not guilty.--Notwithstanding section 5717 (relating to number of votes required), the accused shall be found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility if:\n\n(1) a majority of the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established; or\n\n(2) in the case of a court-martial composed of only a military judge, the military judge or summary court-martial officer determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established.",
