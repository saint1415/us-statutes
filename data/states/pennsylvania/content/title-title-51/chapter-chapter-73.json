      "text": "(a) Options available to employees.--Any employee who is a member of a retirement system other than an active member or inactive member on leave without pay of the State Employees' Retirement System, an active participant or inactive participant on leave without pay of the State Employees' Defined Contribution Plan, an active or inactive member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System or an active or inactive participant of the School Employees' Defined Contribution Plan at the time he is granted a military leave of absence shall be entitled to exercise any one of the following options in regard thereto:\n\n(1) He may continue to make regular payments into the fund during the period of his military leave of absence. The amount of such payments shall be the same as they would have been, had he not been granted a military leave of absence, but had instead remained actively in his employment. The time of making such payments shall be mutually agreed upon by the employee and the retirement association of which he is a member, but in no event shall be less frequent than semiannually. The employer shall make its contributions on the same basis as is used to compute the employee's contributions. In this case, his retirement rights shall be determined on the basis that he was in the active, continuous and uninterrupted employ of his employer for the period during which he was on military leave of absence.\n\n(2) He may discontinue making payments into the fund during the period of his military leave of absence. In such event, the employer shall also discontinue making its contributions during this period. In this case, his retirement rights shall be determined by completely disregarding the period of his military leave of absence for all purposes.\n\n(b) Exercise of options.--Any employee, desiring to exercise option (1) in subsection (a), shall so signify, in writing, to the retirement association of which he is a member within 60 days after the commencement of his military leave of absence or within 60 days after the effective date of this chapter, whichever shall later occur. Any employee who does not exercise option (1) in this manner will be deemed to have exercised option (2).\n\n(c) Change of option.--Any employee who has exercised option (2) in subsection (a), but who, upon the expiration of his military leave of absence, returns to his employment and desires to receive the benefits of option (1), shall have the right to receive such benefits if he shall comply with the following requirements:\n\n(1) He shall, within six months after he returns to his employment, give written notice to the retirement association of which he is a member of his desire to receive the benefits of option (1).\n\n(2) He shall pay into the retirement fund an amount equal to the total payments he would have made had he exercised option (1). Payment of such amount may be spread over a period of time agreeable to the retirement association and the employee, which in no event shall exceed a period commencing with the date he returned to his employment and equal in duration to the duration of his military leave of absence. Such agreed upon payments shall be made in the same manner as his regular payments into the fund are made. In this case, his employer shall pay into the fund an amount equal to the total payments it would have made had the employee exercised option (1). Payment of such amount by the employer shall be spread over the same time as the employee's payments.\n\n(d) Members of State Employees' Retirement System.--An employee who is an active member or inactive member on leave without pay of the State Employees' Retirement System at the time he is granted a military leave of absence shall be entitled to receive credit in the State Employees' Retirement System for the leave as provided in 71 Pa.C.S. Pt. XXV (relating to retirement for State employees and officers).\n\n(e) Members of Public School Employees' Retirement System.--An employee who is an active member or inactive member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System at the time he is granted a military leave of absence shall be entitled to receive credit in the Public School Employees' Retirement System for the leave as provided under 24 Pa.C.S.

The eligibility of an eligible member who is a full-time student for health insurance coverage or ancillary service plans under a parent's policy shall not terminate because of the age of the eligible member when the member's educational program was interrupted because of military duty.\n\n(4) In order to qualify for this extension, the eligible member must:\n\n(i) Submit a form approved by the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs notifying the insurer that the eligible member has been placed on active duty.\n\n(ii) Submit a form approved by the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs notifying the insurer that the eligible member is no longer on active duty.\n\n(iii) Submit a form approved by the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs showing that the student has reenrolled as a full-time student for the first term or semester starting 60 or more days after his or her release from active duty.\n\n(5) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a health insurance policy or ancillary service plan that has been terminated.\n\n(d.1) Applicability to out-of-State members.--This section shall also apply to an individual who is a member of a National Guard or reserve component from another state.\n\n(e) Definitions.--As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection:\n\n\"Ancillary service plans.\"Any individual or group health insurance plan, subscriber contract or certificate that provides exclusive coverage for dental services or vision services.\n\n\"Health insurance policy.\"An individual or group health, sickness or accident policy or subscriber contract or certificate issued by an entity subject to any one of the following:\n\n(1) The act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.682, No.284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921.\n\n(2) The act of December 29, 1972 (P.L.1701, No.364), known as the Health Maintenance Organization Act.\n\n(3) The act of May 18, 1976 (P.L.123, No.54), known as the Individual Accident and Sickness Insurance Minimum Standards Act.\n\n(4) 40 Pa.C.S.
