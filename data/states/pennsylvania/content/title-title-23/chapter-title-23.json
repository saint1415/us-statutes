(a) Single child support order.-- If a proceeding is brought under this part and only one tribunal has issued a child support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized. (a.1) Multiple orders.-- If a proceeding is brought under this part and two or more child support orders have been issued by tribunals of this State, another state or a foreign country with regard to the same obligor and same child, a tribunal of this State having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the individual obligee shall apply the following rules and by order shall determine which order controls and must be recognized: (1) If only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the order of that tribunal controls. (2) If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, an order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls and must be so recognized, but, if an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls and must be so recognized. (3) If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the tribunal of this State shall issue a child support order, which controls. (a.2) Request to determine controlling order.-- If two or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and the same child, upon request of a party who is an individual or which is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this State having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under subsection (a.1). The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification under Chapter 76 (relating to registration, enforcement and modification of support order) or may be filed as a separate proceeding. The request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child support order in effect and the applicable record of payments. The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination. (b) Exclusive jurisdiction.-- The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection (a), (a.1) or (a.2) is the tribunal that has continuing jurisdiction under section 7205 (relating to continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify child support orders) or 7206 (relating to continuing jurisdiction to enforce child support orders). (c) Basis of order.-- A tribunal of this State which determines by order the identity of the controlling order under subsection (a.1)(1) or (2) or (a.2) or which issues a new controlling order under subsection (a.1)(3) shall state all of the following in that order: (1) The basis upon which the tribunal made its determination. (2) The amount of prospective support, if any. (3) The total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are credited under section 7209 (relating to credit for payments). (d) Filing of copy of order.-- Within 30 days after issuance of an order determining the identity of the controlling order, the party obtaining the determining order shall file a certified copy of it with each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement agency that obtains a determining order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. Failure to file a copy of the determining order does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order. (e) Recognition.-- An order which has been determined to be the controlling order or a judgment for consolidated arrears of support and interest, if any, made under this section must be recognized in proceedings under this part.

(a) General rule.-- No intermediary shall place a child in the physical care or custody of a prospective adoptive parent or parents unless a home study containing a favorable recommendation for placement of a child with the prospective parent or parents has been completed within three years prior thereto and which has been supplemented within one year prior thereto. The home study shall be conducted by a local public child-care agency, an adoption agency or a licensed social worker designated by the court to perform such study. (b) Preplacement report.-- A preplacement report shall be prepared by the agency or person conducting the home study. (1) The preplacement report shall set forth all pertinent information relating to the fitness of the adopting parents as parents. (2) The preplacement report shall be based upon a study which shall include an investigation of the home environment, family life, parenting skills, age, physical and mental health, social, cultural and religious background, facilities and resources of the adoptive parents and their ability to manage their resources. The preplacement report shall also include the information required by section 6344(b) (relating to employees having contact with children; adoptive and foster parents). (3) The preplacement report shall include a determination regarding the fitness of the adopting parents as parents. (4) The preplacement report shall be dated and verified. (c) Interim placement.-- Where a home study required under this section is in process, but not yet completed, an intermediary may place a child in the physical care or custody of a prospective adoptive parent or parents if all of the following conditions are met: (1) The intermediary has no reason to believe that the prospective adoptive parent or parents would not receive a favorable recommendation for placement as a result of the home study. (2) The individual or agency conducting the home study assents to the interim placement. (3) The intermediary immediately notifies the court of the interim placement and the identity of the individual or agency conducting the home study.

The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court's own motion or request of another court. (b) Factors.-- Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this Commonwealth shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including: (1) whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child; (2) the length of time the child has resided outside this Commonwealth; (3) the distance between the court in this Commonwealth and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction; (4) the relative financial circumstances of the parties; (5) any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction; (6) the nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child; (7) the ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and (8) the familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.

(b) Duties of registering court.-- On receipt of the documents required by subsection (a), the registering court shall: (1) cause the determination to be filed as a foreign judgment, together with one copy of any accompanying documents and information, regardless of their form; and (2) serve notice upon the persons named pursuant to subsection (a)(3) and provide them with an opportunity to contest the registration in accordance with this section. (c) Notice.-- The notice required by subsection (b)(2) must state that: (1) a registered determination is enforceable as of the date of the registration in the same manner as a determination issued by a court of this Commonwealth; (2) a hearing to contest the validity of the registered determination must be requested within 20 days after service of notice; and (3) failure to contest the registration will result in confirmation of the child custody determination and preclude further contest of that determination with respect to any matter that could have been asserted. (d) Contest over validity of registered order.-- A person seeking to contest the validity of a registered order must request a hearing within 20 days after service of the notice. At that hearing, the court shall confirm the registered order unless the person contesting registration establishes that: (1) the issuing court did not have jurisdiction under Subchapter B (relating to jurisdiction); (2) the child custody determination sought to be registered has been vacated, stayed or modified by a court having jurisdiction to do so under Subchapter B; or (3) the person contesting registration was entitled to notice, but notice was not given in accordance with the standards of section 5408 (relating to notice to persons outside Commonwealth), in the proceedings before the court that issued the order for which registration is sought. (e) Failure to contest.-- If a timely request for a hearing to contest the validity of the registration is not made, the registration is confirmed as a matter of law and the person requesting registration and all persons served must be notified of the confirmation. (f) Res judicata.-- Confirmation of a registered order, whether by operation of law or after notice and hearing, precludes further contest of the order with respect to any matter that could have been asserted at the time of registration.

(a) General rule.-- Upon the filing of a petition seeking enforcement of a child custody determination, the petitioner may file a verified application for the issuance of a warrant to take physical custody of the child if the child is immediately likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this Commonwealth. (b) Petition.-- If the court, upon the testimony of the petitioner or other witness, finds that the child is imminently likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this Commonwealth, it may issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child. The petition must be heard on the next judicial day after the warrant is executed unless that date is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible. The application for the warrant must include the statements required by section 5448(b) (relating to expedited enforcement of child custody determination). (c) Warrant.-- A warrant to take physical custody of a child must: (1) recite the facts upon which a conclusion of imminent serious physical harm or removal from the jurisdiction is based; (2) direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately; and (3) provide for the placement of the child pending final relief. (d) Time of service.-- The respondent must be served with the petition, warrant and order immediately after the child is taken into physical custody. (e) Enforcement.-- A warrant to take physical custody of a child is enforceable throughout this Commonwealth. If the court finds on the basis of the testimony of the petitioner or other witness that a less intrusive remedy is not effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child. If required by exigent circumstances of the case, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour. (f) Appearance of child.-- The court may impose conditions upon placement of a child to ensure the appearance of the child and the child's custodian. Cross References.

For the purpose of this paragraph \"accompany\" means close enough that verbal instructions and guidance can be easily understood. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to section 2363 (relating to trapping exception for certain persons). (9) (Deleted by amendment). (10) Hunt or take, or aid, assist or attempt to hunt or take, furbearers or take any game or wildlife anywhere in this Commonwealth, either with or without a license, or make application, receive or attempt or conspire to receive any license required by this chapter, during any period that these privileges have been denied or withdrawn by this title, by the director or by a magisterial district judge or court.

(4) Subsection (a)(6), (7) or (8) is a summary offense of the seventh degree. (5) Subsection (a)(10) or (11) is a summary offense of the first degree and may result in forfeiture of the privilege to hunt or take game or wildlife anywhere within this Commonwealth for a period of five years.

(c) Units restricted to nonresidential use.-- If a cooperative created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains only units restricted to nonresidential use, it is subject only to sections 4106 and 4107 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that cooperative from the date such amended declaration is recorded as required for a declaration under section 4201. (d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart.

Except as provided in subsection (c) or (f), nothing in this section shall provide a basis for a paying agent or an insurer to delay payment of a settlement, verdict or judgment. (b) General procedure.-- Except as provided in subsection (f), before the prevailing party or beneficiary can receive the proceeds of a monetary award, the prevailing party or beneficiary shall provide his attorney with a statement made subject to 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904 (relating to unsworn falsification to authorities) that includes the prevailing party's or beneficiary's full name, mailing address, date of birth and Social Security number.

The attorney shall obtain a copy of the prevailing party or beneficiary's statement and a lien report from the website at the time of the delivery of the release; the lien report shall be dated within 20 days of the date of the delivery of the release. In the event that there are arrears, the attorney shall make payment of any lien to the department's State disbursement unit from the net proceeds of any monetary award.

(d) Use of private judgment search companies.-- In lieu of receiving the statement and written documentation of arrears or no arrears provided in subsections (b), (c) and (f), an attorney or insurer may use the services of a private judgment search company approved by the department, or an insurer may use the services of the child support enforcement lien program operated through a central reporting agency approved by the department.

(d) Distribution to proprietary lessees upon termination of limited equity cooperatives.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4217 (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), distributions to proprietary lessees in limited equity cooperatives shall be no greater than the amount for which their respective cooperative interests could be transferred as restricted by the declaration and bylaws of the association. (e) Distribution of residual proceeds upon termination of limited equity cooperatives.-- If the declaration of a limited equity cooperative states that it is the declarant's intent that some or all units in the cooperative shall be affordable by low-income and moderate-income persons throughout the existence of the cooperative, then any assets of the association remaining after the distributions to lienholders and proprietary lessees as provided above and in the last sentence of section 4217(e) shall be distributed by the executive board to a public or private entity to be used in a manner consistent with the declarant's intent for the creation of additional housing affordable by low-income and moderate-income persons.

      "text": "§ 4343. Paternity. (a) Determination.-- Where the paternity of a child born out of wedlock is disputed, the determination of paternity shall be made by the court in a civil action without a jury. A putative father may not be prohibited from initiating a civil action to establish paternity. The burden of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. Bills for pregnancy, childbirth, postnatal care related to the pregnancy and genetic testing are admissible as evidence without requiring third-party foundation testimony and shall constitute prima facie evidence of amounts incurred for such services or for testing on behalf of the child. If there is clear and convincing evidence of paternity on the basis of genetic tests or other evidence, the court shall upon motion of a party issue a temporary order of support pending the judicial resolution of a dispute regarding paternity. The Supreme Court shall provide by general rule for entry of a default order establishing paternity upon a showing of service of process on the defendant and a subsequent failure to appear for scheduled genetic testing. (b) Limitation of actions.-- (1) An action or proceeding under this chapter to establish the paternity of a child born out of wedlock must be commenced within 18 years of the date of birth of the child. (2) As of August 16, 1984, the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) shall also apply to any child for whom paternity has not yet been established and any child for whom a paternity action was brought but dismissed because of a prior statute of limitations of less than 18 years. (c) Genetic tests.-- (1) Upon the request of any party to an action to establish paternity, supported by a sworn statement from the party, the court or domestic relations section shall require the child and the parties to submit to genetic tests. The domestic relations section shall obtain an additional genetic test upon the request and advance payment by any party who contests the initial test. (2) Genetic test results indicating a 99% or greater probability that the alleged father is the father of the child shall create a presumption of paternity which may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the results of the genetic tests are not reliable in that particular case. (3) To ensure the integrity of the specimen and that the proper chain of custody has been maintained, the genetic tests of the biological mother, the child or children in question and the alleged father should be conducted by an established genetic-testing laboratory in the course of its regularly conducted business activity, and certified records should be issued. The certified records shall be admissible into evidence without further foundation, authentication or proof of accuracy if no objection is made within ten days prior to trial. The laboratory must be certified by either the American Association of Blood Banks or the American Association for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics. (4) If the court or domestic relations section orders genetic testing, the domestic relations section shall pay the cost of the test, subject to recoupment from the alleged father if paternity is established. (5) A determination of paternity made by another state, whether through judicial proceedings, administrative proceedings or by acknowledgment of paternity, shall be given full faith and credit in the courts of this Commonwealth. (6) A determination of nonpaternity made by another state with respect to a public assistance recipient shall not be binding upon the Department of Public Welfare unless the defendant shows that the department had actual notice of the proceedings, including the date and time of any trial, and a fair opportunity to participate in all material proceedings through counsel of its own choice.

(a) Existing and certain future orders.-- All orders of support existing as of the effective date of this provision, as well as all orders of support entered or modified after the effective date of this provision but before June 30, 1990, shall provide for mandatory attachment of income: (1) if the obligor is in arrears in payment in an amount equal to or greater than one month's support obligation; (2) at the request of the obligor; (3) at the request of the obligee; or (4) as of July 1, 1991, except as provided by subsection (b)(1) and (2). (b) Future orders.-- All orders of support entered or modified on or after July 1, 1990, shall, as part of the order, provide for the mandatory attachment of income unless: (1) the obligor is not in arrears in payment in an amount equal to or greater of one month's support obligation; and (2) (i) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding; or (ii) a written agreement is reached between the parties which provides for an alternative arrangement. The court may, on its own motion, order the attachment of the obligor's income where the court has a reasonable basis to believe the obligor will not comply with the order of support. In making this determination, the court may consider evidence of the person's previous violations of orders entered in any jurisdiction or evidence that the obligor has attempted to conceal income or to transfer, convey or encumber property in order to reduce the obligor's support obligation. Attachment shall occur under this subsection without amendment to the order of support and, if arrearages occur, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing. (c) Assessment of penalty.-- The court may impose a penalty of not more than 10% on any amount in arrears for 30 days or more if the court determines that the arrearage was willful. (d) Arrearages.-- If support arrearages exist at the time of the entry of the order, the order shall specify all of the following: (1) To whom an arrearage is owed and the amount of the arrearage. (2) The period of time for which the arrearage is calculated. (3) The amount of periodic support to be applied to current support and the amount to be applied to arrearages. (4) If support arrearages are owed to more than one obligee, how payments are to be divided and in which priority. (5) A direction that all payments are to be credited to current support obligations first, with any payment in excess to be applied to arrearages. (d.1) Insurance.-- If an obligor or obligee is in violation of an order under section 4326(j)(3) (relating to mandatory inclusion of child medical support), the attachment shall be in favor of the appropriate provider of health care coverage. (e) Attachment process.-- (1) The obligor shall be given notice of the attachment of his income. Such notice shall specify all of the following: (i) The amount to be withheld on account of current support and on account of arrears. (ii) That the order of attachment shall apply to current and future employers. (iii) That the grounds for contesting the order of attachment shall be limited to mistakes of fact. Mistakes of fact shall be limited to errors in the amount of current support owed, errors in the amount of arrearage, an attachment in excess of the maximum amount set forth in subsection (g) or mistaken identity of the obligor. (iv) That attachment has occurred or shall occur in all cases within ten days of the issuance of the notice. (v) A notice of how and when the order may be contested. (2) To contest the order, the obligor must appear before the domestic relations section no later than ten days after issuance of the notice, at which time it will be determined if a mistake of fact has occurred. If so, the order shall be modified accordingly. (f) Request of obligor.-- The court shall also order the attachment of income where the obligor so requests. (g) Maximum amount.-- The maximum amount of any attachment under this section shall not exceed the limits set forth in the Consumer Credit Protection Act (Public Law 90-321, 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.). (h) Termination.-- The court may order the termination of an order of attachment in any of the following instances: (1) The support obligation has terminated and the total arrearages are paid. (2) Where the payee cannot be located and it becomes impossible to forward payments. (3) The result would be unconscionable. (i) Notice to employer.-- The employer of an obligor shall be given notice of the attachment as provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure governing support. This notice shall include reference to subsections (g), (k), (l), (n) and (o) and all of the following: (1) The amount to be attached. (2) That the attachment shall be implemented as soon as possible and no later than 14 days from the issuance of the notice to the employer. (3) That the attachment payment must be sent to the domestic relations section or State disbursement unit, as appropriate, within seven business days of the date the obligor is paid. (4) That the attachment order is binding upon the employer until further notice. (5) That the employer may combine attachment payments into a single payment to the domestic relations section and separately identify the portions attributable to each obligor. (6) That the employer must notify the domestic relations section when the obligor terminates employment and provide his last known address and the new employer's name and address, if known. (j) Effect of compliance by employer.-- Compliance by an employer with an order of attachment of income that is regular on its face operates as a discharge of the civil liability of the employer to the obligor as to that portion of the employment income of the obligor affected. An employer shall not be subject to criminal or civil liability to any individual or agency for conduct in compliance with the order. The employer may deduct from the income of the obligor a one-time fee of $50 for reimbursement of the expense in complying with the order. In no case shall the employer's reimbursement be deducted from the amount of the support order. (k) Effect of noncompliance by employer.-- (1) An employer or officer or employee thereof who willfully fails to comply with an order of attachment under this chapter may, as prescribed by general rule, be adjudged in contempt and committed to jail or fined by the court. (2) The employer shall be liable for any amount the employer willfully fails to withhold from income due an employee under an order of attachment of income and any amount which is withheld from such income but not forwarded to the domestic relations office. (3) The court may, pursuant to general rule, attach funds or property of an employer. (l) Disciplinary action by employer prohibited.-- (1) When an order of attachment on income withholding is about to be or has been entered, an employer or officer or employee thereof shall not use the attachment or possibility thereof as a basis, in whole or in part, for the refusal to employ or for the discharge of an employee or for any disciplinary action against or demotion of an employee. In case of a violation of this subsection, the employer or officer or employee thereof may be adjudged in contempt and committed to jail or fined by the court. (2) Any employee aggrieved by a violation of this subsection shall have the substantive right to bring an action for damages by reason of such violation in a court of competent jurisdiction. (3) The department or a domestic relations section may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation against any employer that willfully violates the provisions of this subsection or that willfully fails to withhold income or to pay such amounts to the State disbursement unit. (m) Certify income.-- Upon request of the domestic relations section, the employer shall report and certify the income of an employee. (n) Bonding.-- The court may attach forms of income other than wages, assets, including spendthrift trusts, and private, public, State, county and municipal pensions, and include bonding or other requirements in cases involving obligors whose income is from sources other than wages, in order to assure that support owed by obligors in this Commonwealth will be collected without regard to the types of these obligors' income or the nature of their income-producing activities. (o) Priority of attachment.-- (Deleted by amendment). (p) Nonresidents.-- Income attachment shall be available to obligees residing outside this Commonwealth where the income of the obligor is derived in this Commonwealth. (q) Priority of attachment.-- An order of attachment for support shall have priority over any attachment, execution, garnishment or wage assignment. The Supreme Court shall by general rule provide for priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld for multiple child support obligees received by an employer for the same obligor under this section and Chapter 75 (relating to direct enforcement of order of another state without registration). (r) Information requests.-- (1) Upon the request of the department, a county domestic relations section or a child support agency of another state, any employer doing business within this Commonwealth, including a for-profit, not-for-profit or governmental employer, shall promptly provide information regarding the employment, compensation and benefits of any employee or contractor of the employer. (2) In addition to any other remedy allowed by law, the department may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation on an individual or entity that willfully fails to comply with a request for information under paragraph (1).

      "text": "§ 4352. Continuing jurisdiction over support orders. (a) General rule.-- The court making an order of support shall at all times maintain jurisdiction of the matter for the purpose of enforcement of the order and for the purpose of increasing, decreasing, modifying or rescinding the order unless otherwise provided by Part VIII (relating to uniform interstate family support) or VIII-A (relating to intrastate family support) without limiting the right of the obligee, or the department if it has an assignment or other interest, to institute additional proceedings for support in any county in which the obligor resides or in which property of the obligor is situated. The Supreme Court shall by general rule establish procedures by which each interested party shall be notified of all proceedings in which support obligations might be established or modified and shall receive a copy of any order issued in a case within 14 days after issuance of such order. A petition for modification of a support order may be filed at any time and shall be granted if the requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances. (a.1) Automatic review.-- Upon request of either parent, or automatically if there is an assignment under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.), each order of support shall be reviewed at least once every three years from the date of establishment or the most recent review. The review shall be for the purpose of making any appropriate increase, decrease, modification or rescission of the order. During the review, taking into the account the best interest of the child involved, the court shall adjust the order, without requiring proof of a change in circumstances, by applying the Statewide guidelines or a cost-of-living adjustment in accordance with a formula developed by general rule. Automated methods, including automated matches with wage or State income tax data, may be used to identify the support orders eligible for review and implement appropriate adjustments. (a.2) Effect of incarceration.-- Incarceration, except incarceration for nonpayment of support, shall constitute a material and substantial change in circumstance that may warrant modification or termination of an order of support where the obligor lacks verifiable income or assets sufficient to enforce and collect amounts due. (b) Notice.-- Each party subject to an automatic child support review shall receive: (1) thirty days' advance notice of the right of such party to request a review and adjustment of the order, except when the adjustment results from a cost-of-living adjustment or other automated adjustment; (2) a copy of any order establishing, modifying or rescinding a child support obligation or, in the case of a denied petition for modification, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the child support order, within 14 days after issuance of such order or determination; and (3) a 30-day period from the date of the notice of a cost-of-living adjustment or other automated adjustment to request an individual review and adjustment in accordance with the Statewide guideline. (c) Transfer of action.-- Where neither party to the action resides or is employed in the county wherein the support action was filed, the court may transfer the matter to any county wherein either party resides or where the defendant is regularly employed. If one of the parties resides outside of this Commonwealth, the action may be transferred to the county of residence or employment of the other party. (d) Arrears as judgments.-- On and after the date it is due, each and every support obligation shall constitute a judgment against the obligor by operation of law, with the full force, effect and attributes of a judgment of court, including the ability to be enforced, and shall be entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in this or any other state. Overdue support obligations of this or any other state which are on record at the county domestic relations section shall constitute a lien by operation of law against all real property owned by the obligor within the county as provided in subsection (d.1). The department shall develop and implement a system for providing notice to the public of liens arising out of overdue support obligations. The system and its procedures shall ensure convenient access to lien information and shall address hours of access by the business community and the general public and access via modem or automated means. Thirty days after publication of notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin that the system has been established, any lien on record shall constitute a lien against any real property in this Commonwealth owned by the obligor and shall also have the effect of a fully perfected security interest in personal property owned by the obligor in which a security interest can arise. The department shall consult with the Department of Transportation in the development of this system to enforce compliance with this subsection as it applies to liens on motor vehicles. The Supreme Court shall by general rule establish procedures for the recording of liens of other states at the county domestic relations section and for the enforcement of liens arising from overdue support without prior judicial notice or hearing. A bona fide good faith purchaser of personal property for value which is subject to a lien under this subsection acquires all title which the transferor had or had the power to transfer pursuant to 13 Pa.C.S. Ch. 24 (relating to title, creditors and good faith purchasers), and the obligee shall have all rights against such property which would be preserved to a fully perfected secured creditor under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9 (relating to secured transactions; sales of accounts, contract rights and chattel paper). The obligation for payment of arrears or overdue support shall terminate by operation of law when all arrears or overdue support has been paid. (d.1) Real property liens.-- (1) Overdue support shall be a lien on real estate within the county in which the overdue support is on record at the county domestic relations section if: (i) the underlying support action is pending in the county domestic relations section or is being enforced by the county domestic relations section; (ii) notice of the existence of the support action is available to the public through a docket book or automated means; and (iii) the county domestic relations section is able to determine the amount of overdue support by reference to its records and is able to provide the amount of the overdue support upon request. (2) The priority and amount of a lien for overdue support shall be determined as follows: (i) The date of the lien for purposes of determining priority shall be determined separately for each unpaid overdue support payment. The date shall be the later of: (A) the date the obligor obtains a real property interest which may be subject to a lien; (B) the date the overdue support becomes a lien under paragraph (1); or (C) January 1, 1998. (ii) The amount of the lien on any date shall be the amount of overdue support shown on that date in the records of the domestic relations section. (3) Upon request of any person, the domestic relations section shall issue a written certification of the amount of overdue support owed by an individual as of the date of the certification and shall note on the docket the date of certification and the amount certified. The interests of any purchaser of real estate for value, mortgagee or other lienor that in good faith purchases the real estate or lends money on the security of the real estate and that records, within 30 days before or 60 days after the date of issuance of a certificate under this paragraph, a deed, mortgage or other encumbrance against the real estate shall not be subject to any lien for overdue support in excess of the amount shown on the certification. (4) The amount of overdue support owed by an obligor and the name of the obligor shall be public information and shall be deemed a public record subject to the act of June 21, 1957 (P.L.390, No.212), referred to as the Right-to-Know Law. (5) A lien arising from overdue support: (i) shall automatically attach to after-acquired property owned by the obligor; (ii) shall retain its priority without renewal or revival; (iii) shall continue to encumber the property upon sale or other transfer; (iv) shall not be divested upon a judicial sale or execution by a person with a lien with less priority; (v) shall not attach to the interest of any other co-owner in the property; (vi) shall expire 20 years after the due date of the last unsatisfied overdue support payment; and (vii) may be released by the court as against abandoned or distressed real property at the request of a governmental unit in order to facilitate the property's sale and rehabilitation. (6) The domestic relations section: (i) shall satisfy the lien promptly upon payment but no later than 60 days following receipt of the payment; (ii) may charge a fee not to exceed the lesser of its estimated cost of producing the report or $20 for the issuance of a lien certification or other written report of the overdue support obligations of an obligor; (iii) shall provide to the prothonotary of the county the identity of obligors and amount of overdue support to be used to make the information available to the public. The information shall be updated at least monthly and shall be provided by a paper listing, diskette or any other electronic means until the Statewide system under subsection (d) is implemented; and (iv) shall transmit at least every 60 days to credit bureaus directly or through the department reports and updates regarding the liens for overdue support. (7) The domestic relations section or employees thereof shall not be liable for errors in the certification of amounts of overdue support or satisfaction of liens for overdue support except as provided in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8550 (relating to willful misconduct). (8) Support may cease to be overdue if a revised payment schedule is established by the court, but any lien which has previously arisen against real estate shall remain in effect until paid or divested. (9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), the interests of any person who recorded a deed, mortgage or other instrument creating an interest in or lien against real estate on or after January 1, 1998, and before the effective date of this subsection shall not be subject to a lien for any overdue support accruing on or after the date the deed, mortgage or other instrument creating the interest or lien was recorded. (e) Retroactive modification of arrears.-- No court shall modify or remit any support obligation, on or after the date it is due, except with respect to any period during which there is pending a petition for modification. If a petition for modification was filed, modification may be applied to the period beginning on the date that notice of such petition was given, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligee or, where the obligee was the petitioner, to the obligor. However, modification may be applied to an earlier period if the petitioner was precluded from filing a petition for modification by reason of a significant physical or mental disability, misrepresentation of another party or other compelling reason and if the petitioner, when no longer precluded, promptly filed a petition. In the case of an emancipated child, arrears shall not accrue from and after the date of the emancipation of the child for whose support the payment is made. (f) Foreign support orders.-- (Deleted by amendment). (g) Notice to obligors and obligees.-- The domestic relations section shall mail notice to obligors and obligees of existing orders informing them that such orders may attain the status of a judgment by operation of law. The notice shall explain the nature of a judgment by operation of law and its effect. Further, the notice shall advise each party to a support proceeding of the party's duty to advise the domestic relations section of material changes in circumstance and of the necessity to promptly request a modification as soon as circumstances change. (g.1) Nondisclosure of certain information.-- If the court finds in an ex parte or other proceeding or if an existing order provides that the health, safety or liberty of a party or child would be unreasonably put at risk by the disclosure of identifying information, the court shall order that the address of the child or party or other identifying information not be disclosed in a pleading or other document filed in a proceeding under this part. Any court order under this subsection must be docketed in the domestic relations section. (g.2) Work activities.-- If an obligor owes overdue support with respect to any child receiving cash or medical assistance, the court shall upon motion of the department or domestic relations section order that overdue support be paid in accordance with a plan approved by the court or that the obligor participate in work activities approved by the department. Work activities include: (1) Subsidized or unsubsidized public or private sector employment. (2) Work experience programs. (3) Work training programs. (4) Community service programs. (5) Job search requirements. (6) Job readiness programs. (7) Education directly related to employment. (8) Attendance at secondary school.

(g.3) Voidable transfers.-- The court may void any voidable transfer by the obligor pursuant to 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 (relating to voidable transactions). It shall be a rebuttable presumption that a transfer by an obligor is voidable as to an obligee if the transfer was made for less than reasonably equivalent value and the transfer occurred after the initiation of a proceeding to establish or enforce support. (h) Applicability.-- This section applies to all support orders whether entered under this chapter or any other statute.

(ii) Second, calculate the Federal Government's share of the remaining amount collected. (iii) Third, pay the Federal Government's share and retain the remainder of the amount collected to reimburse the Commonwealth until the amount equals the amount of unreimbursed cash assistance paid to the assistance group. (iv) Fourth, pay to the assistance group any amounts collected in excess of the amounts distributed or retained under subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii).

(C) In the case of arrearages that accrued before the family received cash assistance from the Commonwealth and which are collected after October 1, 1998: (I) first, pay to the family up to the amount of arrearages that accrued before the family began to receive cash assistance from the Commonwealth; (II) second, treat the balance as reimbursement of assistance in an amount not to exceed the total amount of unreimbursed cash assistance paid to the family and: (a) pay an amount equal to the Federal share of the reimbursed amount to the Federal Government; and (b) retain for the Commonwealth an amount equal to the non-Federal share of the reimbursed amount; and (III) third, pay any remaining amount to the family. (D) In the case of arrearages that accrued while the family received cash assistance from the Commonwealth: (I) first, treat the amount collected as reimbursement of assistance in an amount not to exceed the total amount of unreimbursed cash assistance paid to the family and: (a) pay an amount equal to the Federal share of the reimbursed amount to the Federal Government; and (b) retain for the Commonwealth an amount equal to the non-Federal share of the reimbursed amount; and (II) second, pay any remaining amount to the family. (E) Notwithstanding clauses (A) through (C), the right to any support obligation assigned to the Commonwealth as a condition of receiving cash assistance in effect on September 30, 1997, shall remain assigned after that date. (F) Except for amounts assigned to the Commonwealth under subsection (d), beginning October 1, 1998, any support arrearages collected shall be credited as follows: (I) first, to the period after the family ceased to receive assistance; (II) second, to the period before the family received assistance; and (III) third, to the period during which the family received assistance. (3) (Expired).

Any remaining arrearages shall be paid to the department. The department shall pay to the Federal Government the Federal share of the amounts so retained.

Such assignment shall be effective only up to the amount of assistance received during the period that a family receives assistance.

(a) Cooperation required.-- It is essential to the effective and responsible utilization of assistance funds that applicants and recipients who are caretakers of a child whose circumstances include the reported absence of a legally responsible relative from the household or presence of a putative father cooperate fully with the department and the court or domestic relations section in establishing paternity and in securing child support payments and in all matters set forth in section 4379 (relating to cooperation required). (b) Procedures.-- (1) Upon application for assistance, each applicant or recipient shall be notified that his or her cooperation in the matters set forth in section 4379 shall be required as a condition of eligibility and that failure to cooperate will result in the termination of medical assistance and the reduction of the cash assistance allowance in an amount equal to not less than 25% and may, if provided by departmental regulation, result in the imposition of protective payments for any child in whose behalf the applicant or recipient seeks assistance. (2) If the department or domestic relations section, as applicable, determines that the applicant or recipient fails to cooperate as set forth in section 4379, unless the failure to cooperate was for good cause, the applicant or recipient shall be notified of the noncooperation determination and the basis for the noncooperation determination. The department shall notify the applicant or recipient in writing of the termination of medical assistance eligibility for the applicant or recipient, the reduction of the cash assistance allowance equal to not less than 25% and, if applicable, that protective payments will be imposed for any child so affected ten days after the date of notice. At the expiration of the ten-day period, the department shall impose the termination of medical assistance, the assistance allowance reduction and, if applicable, protective payments. Any hearing or appeal with respect to the notice of noncooperation issued by the department shall be conducted in accordance with the department's regulations governing an applicant's or a recipient's right to hearings. (3) Subject to Federal approval, only when necessary, if after notice and opportunity for hearing the court or domestic relations section determines that the applicant or recipient failed to cooperate as set forth in section 4379 and lacked reasonable excuse for such failure, the court shall notify the applicant or recipient and the department of the basis of the noncooperation determination and order the department to impose a sanction for noncooperation. The department shall issue a notice to the applicant or recipient to terminate medical assistance eligibility, reduce the assistance allowance by not less than 25% and, if applicable, impose a protective payment for any child so affected. The department shall implement the order of the court within ten days of receipt. Any hearing or appeals with respect to the recommendation and order of noncooperation directed by the court shall be conducted by the court in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure as may be promulgated by the Supreme Court governing actions for support. The decision to hold hearings for noncooperation cases shall be at the option of the court or domestic relations section. If the court or domestic relations section chooses not to conduct the hearings on noncooperation, appropriate court or domestic relations section personnel shall be available to provide testimonial evidence by telephone testimony at the time and location set by the department for the departmental appeal hearing. A finding of noncooperation of an applicant or recipient shall not affect an obligor's duty to pay support.",

(a) Recording lease and contents of declaration.-- A lease the expiration or termination of which may terminate the planned community or reduce its size shall be recorded in the same county where the declaration is recorded under section 5201 (relating to creation of planned community). Every lessor of those leases shall execute the declaration, and the declaration shall state the following: (1) The recording data for the lease. (2) The date on which the lease is scheduled to expire. (3) A legally sufficient description of the real estate subject to the lease. (4) Any right of the unit owners to redeem the reversion and the manner whereby those rights may be exercised or a statement that they do not have those rights.

(6) Any rights of the unit owners to renew the lease and the conditions of any renewal or a statement that the unit owners do not have those rights. (b) Limitations on termination of leasehold interest.-- After the declaration for a leasehold planned community is recorded, neither the lessor nor a successor in interest may terminate the leasehold interest of a unit owner who makes timely payment of the owner's share of the rent and otherwise complies with all covenants which, if violated, would entitle the lessor to terminate the lease. A unit owner's leasehold interest is not affected by failure of any other person to pay rent or fulfill any other covenant.

(a) General rule.-- The declaration shall allocate a fraction or percentage of the common expenses of the association and a portion of the votes in the association to each unit and state the formulas used to establish those allocations. Such formulas may take into account unusual attributes of identified units if the formulas state how the deviation from the normal rule applies to such units. (b) Flexible planned communities.-- If units may be added, including by conversion of convertible real estate to one or more units, to or withdrawn from the planned community, the declaration shall state the formulas to be used to reallocate the fractions, as percentages of the allocated share of the common expenses of the association and the percentages of votes in the association, among all units included in the planned community after the addition or withdrawal. (c) Votes.-- (1) Each unit shall be allocated one or more votes in the association. The declaration shall specify how votes in the association shall be allocated among the units and may provide: (i) for different allocations of votes among units on particular matters specified in the declaration; and (ii) for class voting on specified issues affecting a particular class of units if necessary to protect the valid interests of the owners of such units and not affecting units outside of the class. (2) Cumulative voting shall only be permitted if so provided expressly in the declaration and only for the purpose of electing members of the executive board. A declarant may not utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evading any limitation imposed on declarants by this subpart. The declaration may provide that different allocations of votes shall be made to the units in particular matters specified in the declaration. (d) Alteration or partition of allocations.-- Except as provided in section 5107 (relating to eminent domain), 5211 (relating to conversion and expansion of flexible planned communities), 5212 (relating to withdrawal of withdrawable real estate), 5214 (relating to relocation of boundaries between units) or 5215 (relating to subdivision or conversion of units), the votes and common expense liability allocated to any unit may not be changed without the consent of all unit owners whose allocated votes and common expense liabilities are changed. The common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which it is allocated is void. (e) Calculations for undivided interests.-- Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the common expense liabilities allocated at any time to all the units must equal one if stated as a fraction or 100% if stated as percentages. If there is a discrepancy between the allocated common expense liability and the result derived from application of the formulas, the allocated common expense liability prevails. Cross References.

(a) General rule.-- To convert convertible real estate or add additional real estate pursuant to an option reserved under section 5206 (relating to contents of declaration for flexible planned communities), the declarant shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration under section 5219 (relating to amendment of declaration) and comply with section 5210 (relating to plats and plans). The declarant is the unit owner of any units thereby created. The amendment to the declaration must assign an identifying number to each unit formed in the convertible or additional real estate and reallocate votes in the association and common expense liabilities. The amendment must describe or delineate any limited common elements formed out of the convertible or additional real estate, showing or designating the unit to which each is allocated to the extent required by section 5209 (relating to limited common elements). (b) Creations within additional real estate.-- Convertible or withdrawable real estate may be created within any additional real estate added to the planned community if the amendment adding that real estate includes all matters required by section 5205 (relating to contents of declaration; all planned communities) or 5206, as the case may be, and the plat includes all matters required by section 5210. This subsection does not extend the time limit on conversion or contraction of a flexible planned community imposed by the declaration under section 5206. (c) Liability for expenses and right to income.-- Until conversion occurs or the period during which conversion may occur expires, whichever occurs first, the declarant alone is liable for real estate taxes assessed against convertible real estate and all other expenses in connection with that real estate. No other unit owner and no other portion of the planned community is subject to a claim for payment of those taxes or expenses.

(a) General rule.-- Before conveying a unit, other than by deed in lieu of foreclosure, to a purchaser other than a declarant, a declarant shall record or furnish to the purchaser releases of all liens affecting that unit and its rights with respect to any common elements which the purchaser does not expressly agree to take subject to or assume or shall provide a surety bond or substitute collateral for or insurance against the liens adequate in nature and amount. This subsection does not apply to any convertible or withdrawable real estate in which no unit has been conveyed. (b) Other liens.-- Before conveying real estate to the association, the declarant shall have the real estate released from: (1) All liens the foreclosure of which would deprive unit owners of any right of access to or easements of support of their units. (2) All other liens, including, without limitation, real estate taxes, on that real estate unless the public offering statement describes certain real estate which may be conveyed subject to liens in specified amounts.

      "text": "§ 5410. Planned communities containing conversion buildings. (a) Notice of conversion.-- The declarant of every planned community containing one or more conversion buildings shall give each of the residential tenants and residential subtenants, if any, lawfully in possession of a unit or units in a conversion building or buildings a conversion notice no later than one year before the declarant requires the residential tenant and residential subtenant to vacate. The conversion notice must set forth generally the rights of residential tenants and residential subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the residential tenant and residential subtenant at the address of the unit and not more than one other mailing address provided by the residential tenant. Every notice shall be accompanied by a public offering statement concerning the proposed sale of planned community units within such building or buildings. Except as provided in subsection (f), no residential tenant or residential subtenant in a conversion building may be required by the declarant to vacate the unit earlier than one year after the conversion notice date except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy, including those terms that apply to a period occurring in whole or in part after the conversion notice date, may not be altered but may be enforced during that period. Failure of a declarant to give notice to a residential tenant or residential subtenant entitled to such notice under this subsection is a defense to an action for possession against such residential tenant or residential subtenant. (b) Offer to tenant to purchase unit.-- For six months after the conversion notice date, the declarant shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use in a conversion building to the tenant who leases that unit. If the tenant fails to purchase his unit during that six-month period, the declarant may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following six months at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection shall not apply to any rental unit: (1) which, immediately prior to the conversion notice date, was restricted or devoted exclusively to nonresidential use; or (2) the boundaries of which, after the creation of the planned community, will not substantially conform to the boundaries of such unit on the conversion notice date. (c) Effect of wrongful conveyance.-- If a declarant, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, recording of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that unit if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection (b) but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of subsection (b). (d) Notice to vacate.-- If a conversion notice specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, the conversion notice also constitutes a notice of termination of the tenant's lease, subject to revocation in accordance with subsection (i), and a notice to quit specified by section 501 of the act of April 6, 1951 (P.L.69, No.20), known as The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951. (e) Improper lease termination prohibited.-- (1) Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms. (2) Nothing in this section or in any lease shall prohibit a residential tenant, after receiving notice under subsection (a), from terminating any lease without any liability for such termination provided such tenant gives the building owner 90 days' written notice of the intent to terminate the lease. (3) The declarant or owner of any proposed conversion planned community shall not engage in any activity of any nature which would coerce the tenant into terminating any lease, including, but not limited to, harassing tenants or withholding normal services or repairs. (f) Units leased to senior citizens and disabled persons.-- (1) For the purpose of this subsection, an eligible tenant or subtenant shall be a natural person who, on the conversion notice date, lawfully occupies a unit in a conversion building as a principal residence and is 62 years of age or older or is disabled and has occupied the unit for at least two years. For purposes of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to be disabled if on the conversion notice date he is totally and permanently unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impediment, including, but not limited to, blindness. (2) Within 60 days after the conversion notice date, any tenant or subtenant in possession of a unit who believes that he is an eligible tenant or subtenant shall so notify the declarant and shall provide the declarant with proof of his eligibility. Any eligible tenant or subtenant who has established his eligibility as aforesaid shall be entitled to remain in possession of his unit for two years following the conversion notice date, notwithstanding any prior termination date in his lease, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other occupants' peaceful enjoyment of the planned community, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a time period after the conversion notice date, may not be altered but may be enforced during the time period between the original lease termination date and the expiration of this two-year period except as is otherwise provided in paragraph (3). (3) The monthly rental payable by the tenant during the time period commencing upon the later to occur of the original lease termination date or the first anniversary of the conversion notice date and ending upon the expiration of the two-year period described in paragraph (2) shall be the same monthly rental as was payable for the month immediately preceding the original lease termination date, except that, at the landlord's option, such monthly rental may be increased by the lesser of 5% of such monthly rental or the same percentage increase as the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor for the six-month time period commencing on the first day of the first full calendar month after the conversion notice date. (4) Failure of a declarant to comply with the provisions of this subsection is a defense to an action for possession. (g) Tenant meetings; open to the public.-- With respect to any conversion building containing one or more units then occupied for residential use, at least 30 days before the conversion notice date, the declarant shall hold a tenant meeting open to the public in the municipality where the proposed conversion building is located at a place and time convenient to the persons who may be directly affected by the conversion. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given to residential tenants and subtenants in lawful possession of their units, in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice, and to the general public by a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the planned community is located, except that no notice to the general public need be given with respect to conversion buildings as to which the provisions of section 5402(b) (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) are applicable. At such meeting, representatives of the declarant shall briefly describe the following and may, but shall not be required to, discuss other matters: (1) The rights and obligations of tenants and subtenants under this section. (2) Improvements, if any, then planned to be made to the planned community by the declarant. (3) The anticipated approximate range of initial unit sales prices. Specific unit sales prices need not, however, be provided. (4) The anticipated approximate range of estimated monthly common expenses for various types of units; however, specific per unit estimates need not be provided. (h) Community development grants.-- If Federal funds under the Community Economic Development Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35, 42 U.S.C. § 9801 et seq.) have been used to finance the rehabilitation of multifamily rental housing, with the intent that such housing subsequent to the rehabilitation is to be used for residential rental purposes, such housing shall not be converted to a planned community for a period of ten years from the date the rehabilitation is completed. (i) Revocation.-- A declarant may subsequently revoke a conversion notice if the declarant has expressly reserved the right of revocation in the conversion notice and if the notice of revocation: (1) Is given prior to the conveyance of any unit in the planned community occurring after the conversion notice date other than a unit or units conveyed to a successor declarant or as a result of foreclosure of a mortgage on the unit or a deed in lieu thereof. (2) Is given in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice. (3) Is given to all persons who were entitled to receive the conversion notice and who continue to be in lawful occupancy at the time such notice of revocation is given. The giving of a notice of revocation revokes all rights granted under this section but does not revoke the rights granted to residential tenants under subsection (a) or (f), and such rights shall be deemed to have been incorporated in each residential tenant's lease. (j) Waiver of purchase rights.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this subpart prohibiting waiver of rights, any tenant may waive his right to purchase a unit under subsection (b) if the waiver is in writing, is acknowledged and is given in consideration of: (1) an extension of the term of the tenant's tenancy and right of occupancy under this subpart beyond the time period required by subsections (a) and (f) as applicable; (2) the tenant entering into an agreement to purchase another unit in the planned community; or (3) all occupants of the unit making alternative living arrangements. (k) Alteration of terms of tenancy.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (a) or (f), the terms of the tenancy of a tenant or subtenant may be altered with the express written consent of that tenant or subtenant, and such altered terms shall then be the terms of tenancy referred to in this section. (l) Application of section.-- The provisions of this section shall apply only with respect to conversion buildings in which one or more residential tenants or residential subtenants are in lawful occupancy on the conversion notice date, and the only tenants who are entitled to exercise the rights granted under this section are residential tenants or residential subtenants: (1) who are in lawful occupancy of conversion building on the date the declarant gives the conversion notice; or (2) who commence their tenancy after the notice of conversion is given to the other residential tenants without having been notified in writing, at or prior to the commencement of their tenancy, that the property is then a planned community and that they are not entitled to the rights granted under this section. Such rights continue only so long as the lawful occupancy of the tenant or subtenant continues. (Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1486, No.189, eff. 60 days) 2004 Amendment. Act 189 amended subsecs. (d) and (j)(1). Cross References. Section 5410 is referred to in section 5103 of this title.",

(a) Scope.-- Nothing in this section shall be construed to make the declarant responsible for any items of maintenance relating to the units or common elements. (b) General rule.-- (1) A declarant warrants against structural defects in structures constructed, modified, altered or improved by or on behalf of such declarant in: (i) each of the units and the controlled facilities that are part of a unit for two years from the date each unit is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; and (ii) all of the controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and all common facilities for two years except facilities which have been dedicated to a municipality, municipal authority or other governmental unit. (2) Only the association may bring an action for breach of warranty with respect to common facilities and the controlled facilities that are not part of a unit. An action for breach of warranty with respect to one or more units or controlled facilities that are a part of a unit may be brought either by the association or an owner of an affected unit. Any conveyance of a unit during the two-year warranty period shall be deemed to transfer to the purchaser all of the declarant's warranties created under this section. The two years shall begin, as to each of the controlled facilities that are not part of a unit, whenever the controlled facilities that are not part of the unit have been completed and, as to each common facility, whenever such common facilities have been completed or, if later: (i) As to any controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and as to common facilities within any additional real estate or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (ii) As to any controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and as to common facilities within any convertible real estate or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (iii) As to any controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and as to common facilities within any other portion of the planned community, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (c) Planned communities containing conversion buildings.-- A declarant of a planned community containing one or more conversion building warrants as follows: (1) That there are no structural defects in components installed anywhere in the planned community or in work done or improvements made by or on behalf of the declarant anywhere in the planned community. (2) That all units and common elements in each conversion building have been inspected for visible structural and mechanical defects and for other visible conditions that adversely affect the health or safety of residential occupants, as required by section 5404(a)(1) (relating to public offering statement; planned communities containing conversion buildings), except no such inspection is required of any unit if the tenant or other lawful occupant of the unit does not permit such inspection to be conducted. (3) That any defects and other visible conditions found have been repaired. The warranties under subsection (b) shall be applicable to any units and common elements that are located within a building that contains or comprises one or more units and is not a conversion building. Otherwise, the declarant may offer the units, common elements or both in an \"as is\" condition. The declarant of a planned community containing any conversion buildings may also give a more extensive warranty in writing. The times at which the warranties required by this subsection commence and the duration of such warranties shall be as provided in subsection (b). (d) Exclusion or modification of warranty.-- Except with respect to a purchaser of a unit for residential use, the warranty against structural defects: (1) May be excluded or modified by agreement of the parties. (2) Is excluded by expression of disclaimer, such as \"as is,\" \"with all faults\" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties. (e) Limitation of actions.-- No action to enforce the warranty created by this section shall be commenced later than six years after the warranty begins, provided, however, that the limitation period affecting a right of action by the association under this section shall be six years after the warranty begins or two years after the unit owners elect an executive board under section 5303(e) (relating to executive board members and officers), whichever is later. (f) Disclaimer of implied warranties.-- To the extent permitted by applicable law, a declarant may disclaim implied warranties applicable to any unit or common elements to which the warranty provided by this section applies, provided such disclaimer is set forth in the contract for the sale of a unit and in the public offering statement for the planned community of which the unit or common element is a part. The disclaimer required under this subsection shall be set forth in 14-point boldface type. (Mar. 24, 1998, P.L.206, No.37, eff. 60 days; Oct. 19, 2018, P.L.551, No.84, eff. 60 days) 2018 Amendment.

The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court's own motion or request of another court. (b) Factors.-- Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this Commonwealth shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including: (1) whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child; (2) the length of time the child has resided outside this Commonwealth; (3) the distance between the court in this Commonwealth and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction; (4) the relative financial circumstances of the parties; (5) any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction; (6) the nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child; (7) the ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and (8) the familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.

(a) Action authorized.-- An action to enjoin or abate a violation of this chapter may be brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by the Attorney General, the district attorney of the county concerned or the solicitor of the municipality in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. The action shall be brought and tried as an action in equity in the court of common pleas of the county in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. (b) Procedure.-- (1) If it is made to appear, by affidavits or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court that a violation exists, a temporary writ of injunction shall forthwith issue, directed to the operator of the adult entertainment establishment or the owner of the premises, or both, restraining the operator or owner from continuing or permitting the continuation of any violation or violations of this chapter until the conclusion of the hearing and a decision by the court. No bond shall be required in instituting such proceedings. This chapter, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity. (2) It shall not be necessary for the court to find the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but, on finding that the material allegations of the petition are true, the court shall order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises be used in violation of this chapter. Upon judgment of the court ordering the violations to be abated, the court may order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises shall be occupied or used for any purpose for up to one year following the date of the court's order, but the court may, in its discretion, permit the premises to be occupied or used by the operator or owner if the operator or owner, or both, posts a bond or a joint bond in the discretion of the court with sufficient surety to be approved by the court in the penal and liquidated sum of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and conditioned that neither the building nor a part of the building be used in violation of this chapter and that the operator will pay all fines, costs and damages that may be assessed for any violation of this chapter upon the premises. (3) Service of any preliminary or permanent injunction shall be made personally upon the operator and owner of the premises if such persons can be found in the county. If the operator or owner cannot be found, a copy of the order shall be delivered to any employee of the operator on the establishment premises or, in the case of the owner, upon an agent, if any. If no employee or agent can be found or service cannot be made on an employee or agent of the owner, then service shall be made as the court may direct. Any person other than the operator or owner who shall be served with any notice of an injunction shall within 24 hours thereafter deliver the notice to the operator or owner, as the case may be, or mail it to the operator or owner by registered mail if the address of the operator or owner, as the case may be, is known to the person served. Suspension by Court Order. Subsec. (b)(1) was suspended July 31, 1997, S.Ct. Order, to the extent that section 5506(b)(1) provides that Chapter 55, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity.",

      "text": "§ 5508. Actuarial cost method. (a) Employer contribution rate on behalf of active members.-- For each fiscal year, the amount of the Commonwealth and other employer contributions on behalf of all active members shall be computed by the actuary as a percentage of the total compensation of all active members during the period for which the amount is determined and shall be so certified by the board. The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall consist of the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b), and the accrued liability contribution rate as defined in subsection (c). The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall be modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in subsection (f). (b) Employer normal contribution rate.-- The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined after each actuarial valuation on the basis of an annual interest rate and such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the board in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined as follows: (1) From the effective date of this paragraph through fiscal year 2021-2022, as a level percentage of the compensation of the average new active member, which percentage, if contributed on the basis of his prospective compensation through his entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to him in excess of that portion funded by his prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (2) For fiscal year 2022-2023 and each fiscal year thereafter, as a level percentage of the compensation of all active members, which percentage, if contributed from the start of their employment on the basis of their prospective compensation through their entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to them in excess of that portion funded by their prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (c) Accrued liability contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2003, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits, except for the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708 (relating to supplemental annuities), 5708.1 (relating to additional supplemental annuities), 5708.2 (relating to further additional supplemental annuities), 5708.3 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1994), 5708.4 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment), 5708.5 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1998), 5708.6 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2002), 5708.7 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2003) and 5708.8 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002), in excess of the total assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all investment gains and losses over a five-year period), excluding the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members on December 31, 2001, and excluding contributions to be transferred by county retirement systems or pension plans pursuant to section 5507(c) (relating to contributions to the system by the Commonwealth and other employers). The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002, except that, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2002, but before July 1, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded over a period of ten years from the first day of July, coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution for such additional legislative liabilities shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the first annual payment. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, the outstanding balance of the increase in accrued liability due to the change in benefits enacted in 2001 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2002, and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in calendar year 2002 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2003. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2003, but before January 1, 2009, such additional liability shall be funded in equal dollar annual contributions over a period of ten years from the first day of July coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. (3) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund in equal dollar installments over a period of 30 years from July 1, 2010, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits calculated as of the immediately prior valuation date, including the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8, but excluding the benefits payable from the retirement benefit plan established pursuant to section 5941 (relating to benefits completion plan), in excess of the actuarially calculated assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses each year in level annual installments over five years), including the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer will receive for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members, inactive members on leave without pay, vestees and special vestees on December 31, 2009. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (4) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as provided for under this section, except that the rate shall be computed as a rate of total compensation of all active members and active participants for the applicable period and the accrued liability shall be determined and the rate shall be computed without regard to the portion of any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h) for which an annual setoff has not been credited or recognized in a prior fiscal year. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2016, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. In addition to any employer defined contributions made to the trust, the Commonwealth and other employers of participants shall make the accrued liability contributions to the fund certified by the board. (d) Special provisions on calculating contributions.-- In calculating the contributions required by subsections (a), (b) and (c), the active members of Class C shall be considered to be members of Class A. In addition, the actuary shall determine the Commonwealth or other employer contributions required for active members of Class C and officers of the Pennsylvania State Police and enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board who are members of Class A to finance their benefits in excess of those to which other members of Class A are entitled. Such additional contributions shall be determined separately for officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police and for enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. Such contributions payable on behalf of officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police shall include the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of May 12, 1943 (P.L.259, No.120), referred to as the Foreign Casualty Insurance Premium Tax Allocation Law, and on behalf of enforcement officers or investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of April 12, 1951 (P.L.90, No.21), known as the Liquor Code. (e) Supplemental annuity contribution rate.-- (1) For the period July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4 and 5708.5 shall be paid over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002. The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2002 provided for in section 5708.6 shall be as provided in section 5708.6(f). The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2003 provided for in section 5708.7 shall be as provided in section 5708.7(f). The funding for the special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002 under section 5708.8 shall be as provided in section 5708.8(g). The amount of each annual supplemental annuities contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002. (2) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8 shall be paid as part of the accrued liability contribution rate as provided for in subsection (c)(3), and there shall not be a separate supplemental annuity contribution rate attributable to those supplemental annuities. In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (f) Experience adjustment factor.-- (1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability and any increase or decrease in the liabilities and funding for supplemental annuities, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience (recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses over a five-year period), changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, State employees making shared-risk member contributions or having shared-gain adjustments to their regular member contributions, payment of additional accrued liability contributions under section 5507(g), changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of 30 years beginning with the July 1 succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases. The experience adjustment factor calculated under this paragraph shall be determined without regard to any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h). (2) The actuarially required contribution rate shall be the sum of the normal contribution rate, the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate, modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in paragraph (1). (g) Determination of liability for special vestee.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or other law, the total additional accrued actuarial liability resulting from eligibility of special vestees for benefits upon the attainment of superannuation age shall be determined by the actuary as part of the first annual valuation made after June 30, 1997. The resulting additional accrued actuarial liability shall be paid by The Pennsylvania State University to the board in one lump sum payment within 90 days of the board's certification of the amount to The Pennsylvania State University. (h) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.-- The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation to the prior year's final contribution rate. If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by the respective percentage above of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all subsequent fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not apply. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of total compensation of all active members. (i) Final contribution rate.-- For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate shall be 5% of total compensation of all active members. For each subsequent fiscal year for which the collared contribution rate is applicable, the final contribution rate shall be the collared contribution rate plus the costs added by legislation. For all other fiscal years, the final contribution rate shall be the actuarially required contribution rate, provided that the final contribution rate shall not be less than the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b).

      "text": "§ 5622. Petition for approval of designation. (a) General rule.-- Except as provided in subsection (b), a petition for court approval of a designation under this chapter may be made when an individual who is a custodial parent of a minor has entered a rehabilitation facility for treatment of a drug or alcohol addiction or has been subject to emergency medical intervention due to abuse of drugs or alcohol by filing with the court a copy of the designation. (b) Exception where designation has not been entered.-- If a custodial parent has been subject to emergency medical intervention due to abuse of drugs or alcohol and a written designation has not been executed, a family member shall petition the court to hold a hearing to be designated temporary guardian. The petition, which shall require the notarized signature of the petitioner, shall be provided by the court in the following form: Petition for Temporary Guardianship without Consent of Parent I, ‌ (Insert Name, Address and Telephone Number of Family Member Petitioning for Temporary Guardianship and Relationship to Minor), HEREBY DECLARE MY INTENT TO BE APPOINTED TEMPORARY GUARDIAN OF ‌ (Insert Name(s), Address(es) and Telephone Number(s) of Minor(s) for whom the appointment of temporary guardian is being sought) AS A RESULT OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL INTERVENTION RESULTING FROM ABUSE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL BY‌ ‌(Insert Name, Address and Telephone Number), FATHER/MOTHER TO‌ (Insert Name(s) of Minor(s)), ON‌ (Insert approximate date of the event). I HAVE NOTIFIED THE CHILD(REN)'S OTHER PARENT,‌ ‌ (Insert Name, Address and Telephone Number), OF MY INTENT TO PETITION THIS COURT FOR TEMPORARY GUARDIANSHIP. I UNDERSTAND THAT FILING THIS PETITION DOES NOT REVOKE THE PARENTAL RIGHTS OF THE MINOR'S PARENT(S) NOR DOES IT GRANT ME ANY PARENTAL RIGHTS. I UNDERSTAND THAT MY RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS A TEMPORARY GUARDIAN TOWARD THE MINOR CHILD(REN) NAMED ABOVE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON THE COMPLETION OF A HEARING AND RENDERING OF A DECISION BY THE COURT. I UNDERSTAND THAT FILING FEES AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE WAIVED IF I DEMONSTRATE THE FEES AND OTHER COSTS WOULD CONSTITUTE A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO ME AND MY FAMILY. I HEREBY SWEAR OR AFFIRM THAT THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE. ‌ ‌ (DATE) (SIGNATURE OF PETITIONER) (c) Notice.-- (1) The court shall notify a person named in the designation within 10 days of the filing of the petition and of any hearing on the petition. (2) If a designation has not been executed, the petitioner shall notify the custodial parent or parents, noncustodial parent or adoptive parent within 10 days of the filing of the petition and of any hearing on the petition. (3) If the petition alleges that a noncustodial parent cannot be located, that parent shall be notified in accordance with the notice provisions of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure in custody matters. No notice is necessary to a parent whose parental rights have previously been terminated or relinquished. (d) Jurisdiction.-- For purposes of determining jurisdiction under this chapter, the provisions of Chapter 54 (relating to uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement) shall apply. (e) Presumptions.-- In a proceeding for judicial appointment of a temporary guardian, a designation shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the designated temporary guardian is capable of serving as coguardian or guardian. When the designator is the sole surviving parent and when the parental rights of any noncustodial parent have been terminated or relinquished or when all parties consent to the designation, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that entry of the approval order is in the best interest of the child. In any case, if the court finds entry of the approval order to be in the best interests of the child, the court shall enter an order approving the designation petition. (f) Approval without hearing.-- Approval of the designation without a hearing is permitted when the designator is the sole surviving parent, when the parental rights of a noncustodial parent have been terminated or relinquished or when all parties consent to entry of the approval order. (g) Hearing.-- If a hearing is required, it shall be conducted in accordance with the proceedings under Chapters 53 (relating to child custody) and 54. (h) Court appearance.-- If a designation has not been executed and a petition for temporary guardianship has been filed with the court by a family member, the custodial parent and noncustodial parent or adoptive parent shall appear in court in order to consent to or oppose the designation. If notice has been given under subsection (c)(3) and a noncustodial parent does not appear in court, it is presumed that consent to the designation has been granted. (i) Costs.-- A court may waive filing fees and other costs upon application when the petitioner demonstrates the fees and other costs would constitute a financial burden upon the petitioner and the petitioner's family. There shall be a presumption of a financial burden if the income from all sources of the petitioner is less than 300% of the poverty level set by the Federal Government. Cross References.

(a) General rule.-- After the petition has been filed alleging the child to be dependent or delinquent, the court shall fix a time for hearing thereon, which, if the child is in detention or shelter care shall not be later than ten days after the filing of the petition. Except as provided in subsection (f), if the hearing is not held within such time, the child shall be immediately released from detention or shelter care.

The court shall direct the issuance of a summons to the parents, guardian, or other custodian, a guardian ad litem, and any other persons as appear to the court to be proper or necessary parties to the proceeding, requiring them to appear before the court at the time fixed to answer the allegations of the petition.

(b) Personal appearance.-- The court may endorse upon the summons an order: (1) Directing the parents, guardian, or other custodian of the child to appear personally at the hearing. (2) Directing the person having the physical custody or control of the child to bring the child to the hearing. (c) Warrant of arrest.-- If it appears from affidavit filed or from sworn testimony before the court that the conduct, condition, or surroundings of the child are endangering his health or welfare or those of others, or that he may abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court or will not be brought before the court notwithstanding the service of the summons, the court may issue a warrant of arrest. (d) Form.-- A summons and warrant of arrest shall be in such form and shall be served as prescribed by general rules. (e) Waiver of service.-- A party, other than the child, may waive service of summons by written stipulation or by voluntary appearance at the hearing.

(f) Limitations on release.-- The child shall not be released from detention or shelter care under authority of subsection (a) if the failure to hold a hearing within ten days after the filing of the petition is the result of delay caused by the child. Delay caused by the child shall include, but not be limited to: (1) Delay caused by the unavailability of the child or his attorney. (2) Delay caused by any continuance granted at the request of the child or his attorney. (3) Delay caused by the unavailability of a witness resulting from conduct by or on behalf of the child. At the conclusion of any court proceeding in which the scheduled hearing is not held, the court shall state on the record whether the failure to hold the hearing resulted from delay caused by the child.

If the final determination of the Office of Victim Advocate is that the denial of the agency's request for waiver has been improperly denied, the Office of Victim Advocate shall grant the agency's request for waiver in accordance with this section.

The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had. (c) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had.

(e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including, but not limited to, a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined. ARTICLE III Contracts (a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration. 2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance. 3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any, the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom. 4. Delivery and retaking of inmates. 5. Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states. (b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith. ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights (a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. (b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. (c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III. (d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state. (e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state. (f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. (g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory. (h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state. (i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact. ARTICLE V Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition (a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference. (b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VI Federal Aid Any state party to this compact may accept Federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such Federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provisions, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor. ARTICLE VII Entry into Force This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state. ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact. ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements. ARTICLE X Construction and Severability The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",

(a) Single child support order.-- If a proceeding is brought under this part and only one tribunal has issued a child support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized. (a.1) Multiple orders.-- If a proceeding is brought under this part and two or more child support orders have been issued by tribunals of this State, another state or a foreign country with regard to the same obligor and same child, a tribunal of this State having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the individual obligee shall apply the following rules and by order shall determine which order controls and must be recognized: (1) If only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the order of that tribunal controls. (2) If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, an order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls and must be so recognized, but, if an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls and must be so recognized. (3) If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the tribunal of this State shall issue a child support order, which controls. (a.2) Request to determine controlling order.-- If two or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and the same child, upon request of a party who is an individual or which is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this State having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under subsection (a.1). The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification under Chapter 76 (relating to registration, enforcement and modification of support order) or may be filed as a separate proceeding. The request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child support order in effect and the applicable record of payments. The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination. (b) Exclusive jurisdiction.-- The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection (a), (a.1) or (a.2) is the tribunal that has continuing jurisdiction under section 7205 (relating to continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify child support orders) or 7206 (relating to continuing jurisdiction to enforce child support orders). (c) Basis of order.-- A tribunal of this State which determines by order the identity of the controlling order under subsection (a.1)(1) or (2) or (a.2) or which issues a new controlling order under subsection (a.1)(3) shall state all of the following in that order: (1) The basis upon which the tribunal made its determination. (2) The amount of prospective support, if any. (3) The total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are credited under section 7209 (relating to credit for payments). (d) Filing of copy of order.-- Within 30 days after issuance of an order determining the identity of the controlling order, the party obtaining the determining order shall file a certified copy of it with each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement agency that obtains a determining order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. Failure to file a copy of the determining order does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order. (e) Recognition.-- An order which has been determined to be the controlling order or a judgment for consolidated arrears of support and interest, if any, made under this section must be recognized in proceedings under this part.

(b) Maximum rates of interest.-- No obligation or liability bearing interest at a rate in excess of the rate established under section 206 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 1178, 50 U.S.C. App. § 526), as may be amended from time to time, incurred by a person in military service, as described in subsection (a), shall, during any part of the period of service which occurs after the enactment of this section, bear interest at a rate in excess of the rate under section 206, calculated as an annual percentage rate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, unless, in the opinion of the court, upon application thereto by the obligee, the ability of the person in the military service to pay interest upon the obligation or liability at a rate in excess of the rate under section 206 is not materially affected by reason of service, in which case the court may make the order as in its opinion may be just. (c) Recalculation of repayment schedule.-- Upon the reduction of the annual rate of interest pursuant to this section, there shall be a corresponding and proportionate reduction of the amount of any periodic payments made to satisfy the obligation based on a recalculation of the repayment schedule with the same repayment frequency and an interest rate equal to the rate established under section 206 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, amortized over the original term of the loan. (d) Rescheduling of debt payments.-- When a member's income is materially reduced as a result of his being called or ordered to active duty, the member, his spouse or his agent or attorney-in-fact may apply to his creditors for a rescheduling of his debt payments to take into account the material reduction in his income. The member, his spouse or his agent or attorney-in-fact shall provide the creditor with a statement of his income prior to being called or ordered to active duty and his income thereafter. Based on proof of a material reduction in income, the creditor shall thereafter adjust or reschedule the monthly or other periodic payments of the member. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve a member of the obligation to repay the principal of his debt after his release or discharge from active duty and restoration of his income at periodic payments equal to those in effect prior to activation.

The Emergency Management Assistance Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: Article I Purpose and Authorities This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this compact, the term \"states\" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and all U.S. territorial possessions. The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack. This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states. Article II General Implementation Each party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist. The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood. On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact. Article III Party State Responsibilities A. It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall: 1. review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resources shortages, civil disorders, insurgency or enemy attack; 2. review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency; 3. develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans; 4. assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries; 5. protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material; 6. inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness; and 7. provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities. B. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance to another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this compact shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information: 1. a description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, including, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building, inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue; 2. the amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed; and 3. the specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location. C. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities. Article IV Limitations Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer. Article V Licenses and Permits Whenever any person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise. Article VI Liability Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes. No party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness. Article VII Supplementary Agreements Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein shall preclude any state entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies. Article VIII Compensation Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state. Article IX Reimbursement Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense or other cost or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this article. Article X Evacuation Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees. Article XI Implementation A. This compact shall become effective immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon enactment by such state. B. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until 30 days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. C. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States Government. Article XII Validity This compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected. Article XIII Additional Provisions Nothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into Federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under section 1385 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

(a) Authority.-- After a child support order issued in another state has been registered in this State, the responding tribunal of this State may modify that order, upon petition, only if section 7613 (relating to jurisdiction to modify child support order of another state when individual parties reside in this State) does not apply and after notice and hearing it finds one of the following: (1) The following requirements are met: (i) the child, the individual obligee and the obligor do not reside in the issuing state; (ii) a petitioner who is a nonresident of this State seeks modification; and (iii) the respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this State. (2) This State is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this State; and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this State to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order. (b) General rule.-- Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this State, and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner. (c) Restriction.-- A tribunal of this State may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support. If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under section 7207 (relating to determination of controlling child support order) establishes the aspects of the support order which are not modifiable. (c.1) Modification.-- In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this State. (d) Continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.-- On issuance of an order by a tribunal of this State modifying a child support order issued in another state, a tribunal of this State becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. (e) Filing.-- (Deleted by amendment). (f) Retained jurisdiction.-- Notwithstanding subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) or section 7201(b) (relating to bases for jurisdiction over nonresident), a tribunal of this State retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this State if the following are met: (1) One party resides in another state.

(a) Broadband facilities.-- The following apply: (1) An electric cooperative corporation or an affiliate of an electric cooperative corporation may provide broadband services or construct, operate and maintain broadband facilities through an existing easement owned, held or used by the electric cooperative corporation. An electric cooperative corporation may only supply retail broadband services through one or more affiliates. (2) Except as provided for under subsection (b), the attachment of broadband facilities shall not constitute a change to the physical use of the easement, interfere with or impair any vested rights of the property owner subject to the easement or place an additional burden on the property or interests of the owner. (3) A broadband service supplier that is not an electric cooperative corporation may access and attach broadband facilities within an electric cooperative corporation's easement: (i) if an electric cooperative corporation or its affiliates have attached broadband facilities to provide retail or wholesale broadband services or if an electric cooperative corporation, in its sole discretion, gives express written permission to a broadband service supplier to utilize an existing electric easement; and (ii) subject to the terms of applicable safety standards, the structural integrity of the electric infrastructure and the electric cooperative corporation's rules and fees for the attachments. (4) An electric cooperative corporation that elects to provide retail broadband services, through an affiliate, as a broadband service supplier shall permit other suppliers of such services nondiscriminatory access to attach to electric infrastructure, owned or controlled by the electric cooperative corporation, pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions comparable to and no less favorable than those offered to an affiliate of an electric cooperative corporation engaged in the provision of retail broadband services. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit, amend, supersede or otherwise alter the rates, terms and conditions established under existing written attachment agreements for the term of such agreements except as provided under subparagraph (iii). The following shall apply: (i) Except as provided under subparagraph (ii), an electric cooperative corporation shall provide written notice, by first class mail, to any broadband service supplier with which it has an existing written agreement governing the broadband service supplier's attachments to electric infrastructure owned or controlled by the electric cooperative corporation within 90 days of the date on which an electric cooperative corporation's affiliate begins offering retail broadband services over broadband facilities. (ii) An electric cooperative corporation that is providing retail broadband service through an affiliate as of the effective date of this section shall not be required to send the notice required under subparagraph (i). (iii) For a period of five years from receipt of the notice required under subparagraph (i), or from the effective date of this section if subparagraph (ii) applies, a broadband service supplier that has an existing written attachment agreement with an electric cooperative corporation shall have the right to attach to the poles of that electric cooperative corporation at rates that shall not exceed the then-effective rates in the existing agreement, subject to permissible periodic rate adjustments provided in the existing agreement. (5) An electric cooperative corporation may not do any of the following: (i) require a person to purchase broadband services from an affiliate of the electric cooperative corporation as a condition of receiving or continuing to receive electric energy from the electric cooperative corporation; or (ii) disconnect, or threaten to disconnect, electric service to a customer due to the customer's failure to pay for broadband services provided to the customer by the electric cooperative corporation or an affiliate. (b) Applicability.-- Except for the replacement or relocation of existing poles or as otherwise provided by law, subsection (a)(2) shall not apply to the attachment of broadband facilities that are additional freestanding or ground-based structures within the easement. (c) Cross-subsidization.-- The following shall apply: (1) An electric cooperative corporation that supplies retail broadband services through an affiliate shall ensure that the rates charged for the provision of electric service do not include any of its affiliate's retail broadband service costs and shall not use its electric service revenues to subsidize the provision of retail broadband services to the public by an affiliate. (2) An electric cooperative corporation may make capital investments in an affiliate, make loans for the benefit of an affiliate, enter into capital or operating leases with an affiliate and enter into guarantees or other security arrangements for the benefit of an affiliate, all of which may be in amounts, on terms and subject to conditions as the electric cooperative corporation's board of directors approves and determines to be prudent or appropriate. (d) Construction.-- Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall limit any of the rights that exist under the laws of this Commonwealth of any broadband service supplier to secure its own easements for the construction or installation of broadband facilities or the provision of broadband services or to negotiate separate terms or agreements for attachments to electric infrastructure, owned or controlled by an electric cooperative corporation.",

      "text": "§ 4343. Paternity. (a) Determination.-- Where the paternity of a child born out of wedlock is disputed, the determination of paternity shall be made by the court in a civil action without a jury. A putative father may not be prohibited from initiating a civil action to establish paternity. The burden of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. Bills for pregnancy, childbirth, postnatal care related to the pregnancy and genetic testing are admissible as evidence without requiring third-party foundation testimony and shall constitute prima facie evidence of amounts incurred for such services or for testing on behalf of the child. If there is clear and convincing evidence of paternity on the basis of genetic tests or other evidence, the court shall upon motion of a party issue a temporary order of support pending the judicial resolution of a dispute regarding paternity. The Supreme Court shall provide by general rule for entry of a default order establishing paternity upon a showing of service of process on the defendant and a subsequent failure to appear for scheduled genetic testing. (b) Limitation of actions.-- (1) An action or proceeding under this chapter to establish the paternity of a child born out of wedlock must be commenced within 18 years of the date of birth of the child. (2) As of August 16, 1984, the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) shall also apply to any child for whom paternity has not yet been established and any child for whom a paternity action was brought but dismissed because of a prior statute of limitations of less than 18 years. (c) Genetic tests.-- (1) Upon the request of any party to an action to establish paternity, supported by a sworn statement from the party, the court or domestic relations section shall require the child and the parties to submit to genetic tests. The domestic relations section shall obtain an additional genetic test upon the request and advance payment by any party who contests the initial test. (2) Genetic test results indicating a 99% or greater probability that the alleged father is the father of the child shall create a presumption of paternity which may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the results of the genetic tests are not reliable in that particular case. (3) To ensure the integrity of the specimen and that the proper chain of custody has been maintained, the genetic tests of the biological mother, the child or children in question and the alleged father should be conducted by an established genetic-testing laboratory in the course of its regularly conducted business activity, and certified records should be issued. The certified records shall be admissible into evidence without further foundation, authentication or proof of accuracy if no objection is made within ten days prior to trial. The laboratory must be certified by either the American Association of Blood Banks or the American Association for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics. (4) If the court or domestic relations section orders genetic testing, the domestic relations section shall pay the cost of the test, subject to recoupment from the alleged father if paternity is established. (5) A determination of paternity made by another state, whether through judicial proceedings, administrative proceedings or by acknowledgment of paternity, shall be given full faith and credit in the courts of this Commonwealth. (6) A determination of nonpaternity made by another state with respect to a public assistance recipient shall not be binding upon the Department of Public Welfare unless the defendant shows that the department had actual notice of the proceedings, including the date and time of any trial, and a fair opportunity to participate in all material proceedings through counsel of its own choice.

(a) Existing and certain future orders.-- All orders of support existing as of the effective date of this provision, as well as all orders of support entered or modified after the effective date of this provision but before June 30, 1990, shall provide for mandatory attachment of income: (1) if the obligor is in arrears in payment in an amount equal to or greater than one month's support obligation; (2) at the request of the obligor; (3) at the request of the obligee; or (4) as of July 1, 1991, except as provided by subsection (b)(1) and (2). (b) Future orders.-- All orders of support entered or modified on or after July 1, 1990, shall, as part of the order, provide for the mandatory attachment of income unless: (1) the obligor is not in arrears in payment in an amount equal to or greater of one month's support obligation; and (2) (i) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding; or (ii) a written agreement is reached between the parties which provides for an alternative arrangement. The court may, on its own motion, order the attachment of the obligor's income where the court has a reasonable basis to believe the obligor will not comply with the order of support. In making this determination, the court may consider evidence of the person's previous violations of orders entered in any jurisdiction or evidence that the obligor has attempted to conceal income or to transfer, convey or encumber property in order to reduce the obligor's support obligation. Attachment shall occur under this subsection without amendment to the order of support and, if arrearages occur, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing. (c) Assessment of penalty.-- The court may impose a penalty of not more than 10% on any amount in arrears for 30 days or more if the court determines that the arrearage was willful. (d) Arrearages.-- If support arrearages exist at the time of the entry of the order, the order shall specify all of the following: (1) To whom an arrearage is owed and the amount of the arrearage. (2) The period of time for which the arrearage is calculated. (3) The amount of periodic support to be applied to current support and the amount to be applied to arrearages. (4) If support arrearages are owed to more than one obligee, how payments are to be divided and in which priority. (5) A direction that all payments are to be credited to current support obligations first, with any payment in excess to be applied to arrearages. (d.1) Insurance.-- If an obligor or obligee is in violation of an order under section 4326(j)(3) (relating to mandatory inclusion of child medical support), the attachment shall be in favor of the appropriate provider of health care coverage. (e) Attachment process.-- (1) The obligor shall be given notice of the attachment of his income. Such notice shall specify all of the following: (i) The amount to be withheld on account of current support and on account of arrears. (ii) That the order of attachment shall apply to current and future employers. (iii) That the grounds for contesting the order of attachment shall be limited to mistakes of fact. Mistakes of fact shall be limited to errors in the amount of current support owed, errors in the amount of arrearage, an attachment in excess of the maximum amount set forth in subsection (g) or mistaken identity of the obligor. (iv) That attachment has occurred or shall occur in all cases within ten days of the issuance of the notice. (v) A notice of how and when the order may be contested. (2) To contest the order, the obligor must appear before the domestic relations section no later than ten days after issuance of the notice, at which time it will be determined if a mistake of fact has occurred. If so, the order shall be modified accordingly. (f) Request of obligor.-- The court shall also order the attachment of income where the obligor so requests. (g) Maximum amount.-- The maximum amount of any attachment under this section shall not exceed the limits set forth in the Consumer Credit Protection Act (Public Law 90-321, 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.). (h) Termination.-- The court may order the termination of an order of attachment in any of the following instances: (1) The support obligation has terminated and the total arrearages are paid. (2) Where the payee cannot be located and it becomes impossible to forward payments. (3) The result would be unconscionable. (i) Notice to employer.-- The employer of an obligor shall be given notice of the attachment as provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure governing support. This notice shall include reference to subsections (g), (k), (l), (n) and (o) and all of the following: (1) The amount to be attached. (2) That the attachment shall be implemented as soon as possible and no later than 14 days from the issuance of the notice to the employer. (3) That the attachment payment must be sent to the domestic relations section or State disbursement unit, as appropriate, within seven business days of the date the obligor is paid. (4) That the attachment order is binding upon the employer until further notice. (5) That the employer may combine attachment payments into a single payment to the domestic relations section and separately identify the portions attributable to each obligor. (6) That the employer must notify the domestic relations section when the obligor terminates employment and provide his last known address and the new employer's name and address, if known. (j) Effect of compliance by employer.-- Compliance by an employer with an order of attachment of income that is regular on its face operates as a discharge of the civil liability of the employer to the obligor as to that portion of the employment income of the obligor affected. An employer shall not be subject to criminal or civil liability to any individual or agency for conduct in compliance with the order. The employer may deduct from the income of the obligor a one-time fee of $50 for reimbursement of the expense in complying with the order. In no case shall the employer's reimbursement be deducted from the amount of the support order. (k) Effect of noncompliance by employer.-- (1) An employer or officer or employee thereof who willfully fails to comply with an order of attachment under this chapter may, as prescribed by general rule, be adjudged in contempt and committed to jail or fined by the court. (2) The employer shall be liable for any amount the employer willfully fails to withhold from income due an employee under an order of attachment of income and any amount which is withheld from such income but not forwarded to the domestic relations office. (3) The court may, pursuant to general rule, attach funds or property of an employer. (l) Disciplinary action by employer prohibited.-- (1) When an order of attachment on income withholding is about to be or has been entered, an employer or officer or employee thereof shall not use the attachment or possibility thereof as a basis, in whole or in part, for the refusal to employ or for the discharge of an employee or for any disciplinary action against or demotion of an employee. In case of a violation of this subsection, the employer or officer or employee thereof may be adjudged in contempt and committed to jail or fined by the court. (2) Any employee aggrieved by a violation of this subsection shall have the substantive right to bring an action for damages by reason of such violation in a court of competent jurisdiction. (3) The department or a domestic relations section may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation against any employer that willfully violates the provisions of this subsection or that willfully fails to withhold income or to pay such amounts to the State disbursement unit. (m) Certify income.-- Upon request of the domestic relations section, the employer shall report and certify the income of an employee. (n) Bonding.-- The court may attach forms of income other than wages, assets, including spendthrift trusts, and private, public, State, county and municipal pensions, and include bonding or other requirements in cases involving obligors whose income is from sources other than wages, in order to assure that support owed by obligors in this Commonwealth will be collected without regard to the types of these obligors' income or the nature of their income-producing activities. (o) Priority of attachment.-- (Deleted by amendment). (p) Nonresidents.-- Income attachment shall be available to obligees residing outside this Commonwealth where the income of the obligor is derived in this Commonwealth. (q) Priority of attachment.-- An order of attachment for support shall have priority over any attachment, execution, garnishment or wage assignment. The Supreme Court shall by general rule provide for priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld for multiple child support obligees received by an employer for the same obligor under this section and Chapter 75 (relating to direct enforcement of order of another state without registration). (r) Information requests.-- (1) Upon the request of the department, a county domestic relations section or a child support agency of another state, any employer doing business within this Commonwealth, including a for-profit, not-for-profit or governmental employer, shall promptly provide information regarding the employment, compensation and benefits of any employee or contractor of the employer. (2) In addition to any other remedy allowed by law, the department may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation on an individual or entity that willfully fails to comply with a request for information under paragraph (1).

(a) General rule.-- The court making an order of support shall at all times maintain jurisdiction of the matter for the purpose of enforcement of the order and for the purpose of increasing, decreasing, modifying or rescinding the order unless otherwise provided by Part VIII (relating to uniform interstate family support) or VIII-A (relating to intrastate family support) without limiting the right of the obligee, or the department if it has an assignment or other interest, to institute additional proceedings for support in any county in which the obligor resides or in which property of the obligor is situated. The Supreme Court shall by general rule establish procedures by which each interested party shall be notified of all proceedings in which support obligations might be established or modified and shall receive a copy of any order issued in a case within 14 days after issuance of such order. A petition for modification of a support order may be filed at any time and shall be granted if the requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances. (a.1) Automatic review.-- Upon request of either parent, or automatically if there is an assignment under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.), each order of support shall be reviewed at least once every three years from the date of establishment or the most recent review. The review shall be for the purpose of making any appropriate increase, decrease, modification or rescission of the order. During the review, taking into the account the best interest of the child involved, the court shall adjust the order, without requiring proof of a change in circumstances, by applying the Statewide guidelines or a cost-of-living adjustment in accordance with a formula developed by general rule. Automated methods, including automated matches with wage or State income tax data, may be used to identify the support orders eligible for review and implement appropriate adjustments. (a.2) Effect of incarceration.-- Incarceration, except incarceration for nonpayment of support, shall constitute a material and substantial change in circumstance that may warrant modification or termination of an order of support where the obligor lacks verifiable income or assets sufficient to enforce and collect amounts due. (b) Notice.-- Each party subject to an automatic child support review shall receive: (1) thirty days' advance notice of the right of such party to request a review and adjustment of the order, except when the adjustment results from a cost-of-living adjustment or other automated adjustment; (2) a copy of any order establishing, modifying or rescinding a child support obligation or, in the case of a denied petition for modification, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the child support order, within 14 days after issuance of such order or determination; and (3) a 30-day period from the date of the notice of a cost-of-living adjustment or other automated adjustment to request an individual review and adjustment in accordance with the Statewide guideline. (c) Transfer of action.-- Where neither party to the action resides or is employed in the county wherein the support action was filed, the court may transfer the matter to any county wherein either party resides or where the defendant is regularly employed. If one of the parties resides outside of this Commonwealth, the action may be transferred to the county of residence or employment of the other party. (d) Arrears as judgments.-- On and after the date it is due, each and every support obligation shall constitute a judgment against the obligor by operation of law, with the full force, effect and attributes of a judgment of court, including the ability to be enforced, and shall be entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in this or any other state. Overdue support obligations of this or any other state which are on record at the county domestic relations section shall constitute a lien by operation of law against all real property owned by the obligor within the county as provided in subsection (d.1). The department shall develop and implement a system for providing notice to the public of liens arising out of overdue support obligations. The system and its procedures shall ensure convenient access to lien information and shall address hours of access by the business community and the general public and access via modem or automated means. Thirty days after publication of notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin that the system has been established, any lien on record shall constitute a lien against any real property in this Commonwealth owned by the obligor and shall also have the effect of a fully perfected security interest in personal property owned by the obligor in which a security interest can arise. The department shall consult with the Department of Transportation in the development of this system to enforce compliance with this subsection as it applies to liens on motor vehicles. The Supreme Court shall by general rule establish procedures for the recording of liens of other states at the county domestic relations section and for the enforcement of liens arising from overdue support without prior judicial notice or hearing. A bona fide good faith purchaser of personal property for value which is subject to a lien under this subsection acquires all title which the transferor had or had the power to transfer pursuant to 13 Pa.C.S. Ch. 24 (relating to title, creditors and good faith purchasers), and the obligee shall have all rights against such property which would be preserved to a fully perfected secured creditor under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9 (relating to secured transactions; sales of accounts, contract rights and chattel paper). The obligation for payment of arrears or overdue support shall terminate by operation of law when all arrears or overdue support has been paid. (d.1) Real property liens.-- (1) Overdue support shall be a lien on real estate within the county in which the overdue support is on record at the county domestic relations section if: (i) the underlying support action is pending in the county domestic relations section or is being enforced by the county domestic relations section; (ii) notice of the existence of the support action is available to the public through a docket book or automated means; and (iii) the county domestic relations section is able to determine the amount of overdue support by reference to its records and is able to provide the amount of the overdue support upon request. (2) The priority and amount of a lien for overdue support shall be determined as follows: (i) The date of the lien for purposes of determining priority shall be determined separately for each unpaid overdue support payment. The date shall be the later of: (A) the date the obligor obtains a real property interest which may be subject to a lien; (B) the date the overdue support becomes a lien under paragraph (1); or (C) January 1, 1998. (ii) The amount of the lien on any date shall be the amount of overdue support shown on that date in the records of the domestic relations section. (3) Upon request of any person, the domestic relations section shall issue a written certification of the amount of overdue support owed by an individual as of the date of the certification and shall note on the docket the date of certification and the amount certified. The interests of any purchaser of real estate for value, mortgagee or other lienor that in good faith purchases the real estate or lends money on the security of the real estate and that records, within 30 days before or 60 days after the date of issuance of a certificate under this paragraph, a deed, mortgage or other encumbrance against the real estate shall not be subject to any lien for overdue support in excess of the amount shown on the certification. (4) The amount of overdue support owed by an obligor and the name of the obligor shall be public information and shall be deemed a public record subject to the act of June 21, 1957 (P.L.390, No.212), referred to as the Right-to-Know Law. (5) A lien arising from overdue support: (i) shall automatically attach to after-acquired property owned by the obligor; (ii) shall retain its priority without renewal or revival; (iii) shall continue to encumber the property upon sale or other transfer; (iv) shall not be divested upon a judicial sale or execution by a person with a lien with less priority; (v) shall not attach to the interest of any other co-owner in the property; (vi) shall expire 20 years after the due date of the last unsatisfied overdue support payment; and (vii) may be released by the court as against abandoned or distressed real property at the request of a governmental unit in order to facilitate the property's sale and rehabilitation. (6) The domestic relations section: (i) shall satisfy the lien promptly upon payment but no later than 60 days following receipt of the payment; (ii) may charge a fee not to exceed the lesser of its estimated cost of producing the report or $20 for the issuance of a lien certification or other written report of the overdue support obligations of an obligor; (iii) shall provide to the prothonotary of the county the identity of obligors and amount of overdue support to be used to make the information available to the public. The information shall be updated at least monthly and shall be provided by a paper listing, diskette or any other electronic means until the Statewide system under subsection (d) is implemented; and (iv) shall transmit at least every 60 days to credit bureaus directly or through the department reports and updates regarding the liens for overdue support. (7) The domestic relations section or employees thereof shall not be liable for errors in the certification of amounts of overdue support or satisfaction of liens for overdue support except as provided in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8550 (relating to willful misconduct). (8) Support may cease to be overdue if a revised payment schedule is established by the court, but any lien which has previously arisen against real estate shall remain in effect until paid or divested. (9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), the interests of any person who recorded a deed, mortgage or other instrument creating an interest in or lien against real estate on or after January 1, 1998, and before the effective date of this subsection shall not be subject to a lien for any overdue support accruing on or after the date the deed, mortgage or other instrument creating the interest or lien was recorded. (e) Retroactive modification of arrears.-- No court shall modify or remit any support obligation, on or after the date it is due, except with respect to any period during which there is pending a petition for modification. If a petition for modification was filed, modification may be applied to the period beginning on the date that notice of such petition was given, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligee or, where the obligee was the petitioner, to the obligor. However, modification may be applied to an earlier period if the petitioner was precluded from filing a petition for modification by reason of a significant physical or mental disability, misrepresentation of another party or other compelling reason and if the petitioner, when no longer precluded, promptly filed a petition. In the case of an emancipated child, arrears shall not accrue from and after the date of the emancipation of the child for whose support the payment is made. (f) Foreign support orders.-- (Deleted by amendment). (g) Notice to obligors and obligees.-- The domestic relations section shall mail notice to obligors and obligees of existing orders informing them that such orders may attain the status of a judgment by operation of law. The notice shall explain the nature of a judgment by operation of law and its effect. Further, the notice shall advise each party to a support proceeding of the party's duty to advise the domestic relations section of material changes in circumstance and of the necessity to promptly request a modification as soon as circumstances change. (g.1) Nondisclosure of certain information.-- If the court finds in an ex parte or other proceeding or if an existing order provides that the health, safety or liberty of a party or child would be unreasonably put at risk by the disclosure of identifying information, the court shall order that the address of the child or party or other identifying information not be disclosed in a pleading or other document filed in a proceeding under this part. Any court order under this subsection must be docketed in the domestic relations section. (g.2) Work activities.-- If an obligor owes overdue support with respect to any child receiving cash or medical assistance, the court shall upon motion of the department or domestic relations section order that overdue support be paid in accordance with a plan approved by the court or that the obligor participate in work activities approved by the department. Work activities include: (1) Subsidized or unsubsidized public or private sector employment. (2) Work experience programs. (3) Work training programs. (4) Community service programs. (5) Job search requirements. (6) Job readiness programs. (7) Education directly related to employment. (8) Attendance at secondary school. (9) For a person who has not graduated high school, study leading to a high school diploma or equivalent. (g.3) Voidable transfers.-- The court may void any voidable transfer by the obligor pursuant to 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 (relating to voidable transactions). It shall be a rebuttable presumption that a transfer by an obligor is voidable as to an obligee if the transfer was made for less than reasonably equivalent value and the transfer occurred after the initiation of a proceeding to establish or enforce support. (h) Applicability.-- This section applies to all support orders whether entered under this chapter or any other statute.

(ii) Second, calculate the Federal Government's share of the remaining amount collected. (iii) Third, pay the Federal Government's share and retain the remainder of the amount collected to reimburse the Commonwealth until the amount equals the amount of unreimbursed cash assistance paid to the assistance group.

(B) (Deleted by amendment). (C) In the case of arrearages that accrued before the family received cash assistance from the Commonwealth and which are collected after October 1, 1998: (I) first, pay to the family up to the amount of arrearages that accrued before the family began to receive cash assistance from the Commonwealth; (II) second, treat the balance as reimbursement of assistance in an amount not to exceed the total amount of unreimbursed cash assistance paid to the family and: (a) pay an amount equal to the Federal share of the reimbursed amount to the Federal Government; and (b) retain for the Commonwealth an amount equal to the non-Federal share of the reimbursed amount; and (III) third, pay any remaining amount to the family. (D) In the case of arrearages that accrued while the family received cash assistance from the Commonwealth: (I) first, treat the amount collected as reimbursement of assistance in an amount not to exceed the total amount of unreimbursed cash assistance paid to the family and: (a) pay an amount equal to the Federal share of the reimbursed amount to the Federal Government; and (b) retain for the Commonwealth an amount equal to the non-Federal share of the reimbursed amount; and (II) second, pay any remaining amount to the family. (E) Notwithstanding clauses (A) through (C), the right to any support obligation assigned to the Commonwealth as a condition of receiving cash assistance in effect on September 30, 1997, shall remain assigned after that date. (F) Except for amounts assigned to the Commonwealth under subsection (d), beginning October 1, 1998, any support arrearages collected shall be credited as follows: (I) first, to the period after the family ceased to receive assistance; (II) second, to the period before the family received assistance; and (III) third, to the period during which the family received assistance. (3) (Expired).

Any remaining arrearages shall be paid to the department. The department shall pay to the Federal Government the Federal share of the amounts so retained.

Such assignment shall be effective only up to the amount of assistance received during the period that a family receives assistance.

(a) Cooperation required.-- It is essential to the effective and responsible utilization of assistance funds that applicants and recipients who are caretakers of a child whose circumstances include the reported absence of a legally responsible relative from the household or presence of a putative father cooperate fully with the department and the court or domestic relations section in establishing paternity and in securing child support payments and in all matters set forth in section 4379 (relating to cooperation required). (b) Procedures.-- (1) Upon application for assistance, each applicant or recipient shall be notified that his or her cooperation in the matters set forth in section 4379 shall be required as a condition of eligibility and that failure to cooperate will result in the termination of medical assistance and the reduction of the cash assistance allowance in an amount equal to not less than 25% and may, if provided by departmental regulation, result in the imposition of protective payments for any child in whose behalf the applicant or recipient seeks assistance. (2) If the department or domestic relations section, as applicable, determines that the applicant or recipient fails to cooperate as set forth in section 4379, unless the failure to cooperate was for good cause, the applicant or recipient shall be notified of the noncooperation determination and the basis for the noncooperation determination. The department shall notify the applicant or recipient in writing of the termination of medical assistance eligibility for the applicant or recipient, the reduction of the cash assistance allowance equal to not less than 25% and, if applicable, that protective payments will be imposed for any child so affected ten days after the date of notice. At the expiration of the ten-day period, the department shall impose the termination of medical assistance, the assistance allowance reduction and, if applicable, protective payments. Any hearing or appeal with respect to the notice of noncooperation issued by the department shall be conducted in accordance with the department's regulations governing an applicant's or a recipient's right to hearings. (3) Subject to Federal approval, only when necessary, if after notice and opportunity for hearing the court or domestic relations section determines that the applicant or recipient failed to cooperate as set forth in section 4379 and lacked reasonable excuse for such failure, the court shall notify the applicant or recipient and the department of the basis of the noncooperation determination and order the department to impose a sanction for noncooperation. The department shall issue a notice to the applicant or recipient to terminate medical assistance eligibility, reduce the assistance allowance by not less than 25% and, if applicable, impose a protective payment for any child so affected. The department shall implement the order of the court within ten days of receipt. Any hearing or appeals with respect to the recommendation and order of noncooperation directed by the court shall be conducted by the court in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure as may be promulgated by the Supreme Court governing actions for support. The decision to hold hearings for noncooperation cases shall be at the option of the court or domestic relations section. If the court or domestic relations section chooses not to conduct the hearings on noncooperation, appropriate court or domestic relations section personnel shall be available to provide testimonial evidence by telephone testimony at the time and location set by the department for the departmental appeal hearing. A finding of noncooperation of an applicant or recipient shall not affect an obligor's duty to pay support.",

(a) General rule.-- After the petition has been filed alleging the child to be dependent or delinquent, the court shall fix a time for hearing thereon, which, if the child is in detention or shelter care shall not be later than ten days after the filing of the petition. Except as provided in subsection (f), if the hearing is not held within such time, the child shall be immediately released from detention or shelter care. A child may be detained or kept in shelter care for an additional single period not to exceed ten days where: (1) the court determines at a hearing that: (i) evidence material to the case is unavailable; (ii) due diligence to obtain such evidence has been exercised; and (iii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that such evidence will be available at a later date; and (2) the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (i) the life of the child would be in danger; (ii) the community would be exposed to a specific danger; or (iii) the child will abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court. The court shall direct the issuance of a summons to the parents, guardian, or other custodian, a guardian ad litem, and any other persons as appear to the court to be proper or necessary parties to the proceeding, requiring them to appear before the court at the time fixed to answer the allegations of the petition. The summons shall also be directed to the child if he is 14 or more years of age or is alleged to be a delinquent. A copy of the petition shall accompany the summons. (b) Personal appearance.-- The court may endorse upon the summons an order: (1) Directing the parents, guardian, or other custodian of the child to appear personally at the hearing. (2) Directing the person having the physical custody or control of the child to bring the child to the hearing. (c) Warrant of arrest.-- If it appears from affidavit filed or from sworn testimony before the court that the conduct, condition, or surroundings of the child are endangering his health or welfare or those of others, or that he may abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court or will not be brought before the court notwithstanding the service of the summons, the court may issue a warrant of arrest. (d) Form.-- A summons and warrant of arrest shall be in such form and shall be served as prescribed by general rules. (e) Waiver of service.-- A party, other than the child, may waive service of summons by written stipulation or by voluntary appearance at the hearing. If the child is present at the hearing, his counsel, with the consent of the parent, guardian, or other custodian, or guardian ad litem, may waive service of summons in his behalf. (f) Limitations on release.-- The child shall not be released from detention or shelter care under authority of subsection (a) if the failure to hold a hearing within ten days after the filing of the petition is the result of delay caused by the child. Delay caused by the child shall include, but not be limited to: (1) Delay caused by the unavailability of the child or his attorney. (2) Delay caused by any continuance granted at the request of the child or his attorney. (3) Delay caused by the unavailability of a witness resulting from conduct by or on behalf of the child. At the conclusion of any court proceeding in which the scheduled hearing is not held, the court shall state on the record whether the failure to hold the hearing resulted from delay caused by the child. Where the court determines that failure to hold a hearing is the result of delay caused by the child, the child may continue to be held in detention or shelter care.
