No notice is necessary to a parent whose parental rights have previously been terminated or relinquished.\n\n(c) Jurisdiction.--For purposes of determining jurisdiction under this chapter, the provisions of Chapter 54 (relating to uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement) shall apply.\n\n(d) Presumptions.--In a proceeding for judicial appointment of a standby guardian, a designation shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the designated standby guardian is capable of serving as coguardian or guardian.

In any case, if the court finds entry of the approval order to be in the best interest of the child, the court shall enter an order approving the designation petition.\n\n(e) Approval without hearing.--Approval of the designation without a hearing is permitted when the designator is the sole surviving parent, when the parental rights of any noncustodial parent have been terminated or relinquished or when all parties consent to entry of the approval order.\n\n(f) Hearing.--In the event a hearing is required, it shall be conducted in accordance with the proceedings set forth in Chapters 53 (relating to custody) and 54.\n\n(g) Court appearance.--The designator need not appear in court if the designator is medically unable to appear.\n\n(June 15, 2004, P.L.236, No.39, eff. 60 days)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 39 amended subsecs.

The commencement of the standby guardian's authority to act as coguardian pursuant to a determination of incapacity, a determination of debilitation and consent or the receipt of consent alone shall not itself divest the designator of any parental rights but shall confer upon the standby guardian concurrent or shared custody of the child. The commencement of the standby guardian's authority to act as guardian pursuant to the death of the designator shall not confer upon the standby guardian more than physical and legal custody of the child as defined in Chapter 53 (relating to custody). A coguardian shall assure frequent and continuing contact with and physical access to the child and shall further assure the involvement of the parent, to include, to the greatest extent possible, in the decision making on behalf of the child.\n\n(b) Effect of filing.--The designator may file a petition for approval of a designation with the court at any time. If the petition is approved by the court before the occurrence of the triggering event, the standby guardian's authority will commence automatically upon the occurrence of the triggering event. No further petition or confirmation is necessary. If a designation has been made but the petition for approval of the designation has not been filed and a triggering event has occurred, the standby guardian shall have temporary legal authority to act as a coguardian or guardian of the minor without the direction of the court for a period of 60 days. The standby guardian shall within that period file a petition for approval in accordance with section 5612 (relating to petition for approval of a designation). If no petition is filed within the specified 60 days, the standby guardian shall lose all authority to act as coguardian or guardian. If a petition is filed but the court does not act upon it within the 60-day period, the temporary legal authority to act as coguardian or guardian shall continue until the court orders otherwise.\n\n(c) Parental rights.--The commencement of a coguardian's or guardian's authority under this subchapter may not itself divest a parent or legal guardian of any parental or guardianship rights.\n\n(d) Restored capacity.--If a licensed physician determines that the designator has regained capacity, the coguardian's authority which commenced pursuant to the occurrence of a triggering event shall become inactive, and the coguardian shall return to having no authority. Failure of a coguardian to comply with this provision and to immediately return the minor to the designator's care shall entitle the designator to an emergency hearing in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nReferences in Text.Former Chapter 53 (Custody), referred to in this section, is repealed.
