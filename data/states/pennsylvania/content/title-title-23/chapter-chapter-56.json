      "text": "(a) General rule.--A custodial parent, a legal custodian or legal guardian may designate a standby guardian by means of a written designation unless the minor has another parent or adoptive parent:\n\n(1) whose parental rights have not been terminated or relinquished;\n\n(2) whose whereabouts are known; and\n\n(3) who is willing and able to make and carry out the day-to-day child-care decisions concerning the minor.\n\n(b) Exception where other parent consents.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), a parent, legal custodian or legal guardian may designate a standby guardian with the consent of the other parent.\n\n(c) Contents.--\n\n(1) A designation of a standby guardianship shall identify the custodial parent, legal custodian or legal guardian making the designation, the minor or minors, any other parent, the standby guardian and the triggering event or events upon which a named standby guardian shall become a coguardian or guardian. If desired, different standby guardians may be designated for different triggering events. The designation shall also include the signed consent of the standby guardian and the signed consent of any other parent or an indication why the other parent's consent is not necessary.\n\n(2) The designation shall be signed by the designating parent, legal custodian or legal guardian in the presence of two witnesses who are 18 years of age or older and not otherwise named in the designation, who shall also sign the designation. If the parent, legal custodian or legal guardian is physically unable to sign the designation, the parent, legal custodian or legal guardian may direct another person not named in the designation to sign on the parent's, the legal custodian's or the legal guardian's behalf in the presence of the parent, legal custodian or legal guardian and the witnesses.\n\n(3) A parent, legal custodian or legal guardian may also but need not designate an alternate in the designation.\n\n(4) A designation may but need not be in the following form:\n\nI (insert name of designator) do hereby appoint (insert name, address and telephone number of standby guardian) as the standby guardian of (insert name(s) of minor(s)) to take effect upon the occurrence of the following triggering event or events (insert specific triggering events).\n\nI hereby revoke all former wills and codicils to the extent that there is a conflict between those formerly executed documents and this, my duly executed standby guardian designation.\n\nI am the (insert designator's relationship to minor(s)) of (insert name(s) of minor(s)).\n\n(Insert name(s) of minor(s)'s other parent(s)) is the father/mother of (insert name(s) of minor(s)).\n\nHis/her address is:\n\n(Check all that apply):\n\nHe/she died on (insert date of death).\n\nHis/her parental rights were terminated or\n\nrelinquished on (insert date of termination or\n\nrelinquishment).\n\nHis/her whereabouts are unknown.

If I have indicated \"my death\" as the triggering event, it is my intent that the person named in the designation to be standby guardian for my minor child(ren) in the event of my death shall be appointed as guardian of my minor child(ren) when I die.\n\nIt is my intention to retain full parental rights to the extent consistent with my condition and to retain the authority to revoke the standby guardianship if I so choose.\n\nThis designation is made after careful reflection, while I am of sound mind.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n(Date) (Designator's signature)\n\n_________________________ ___________________________\n\n(Witness's signature) (Witness's signature)\n\n_________________________ ___________________________\n\n(Number and Street) (Number and Street)\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n(City, State and Zip Code) (City, State and Zip Code)\n\nIf applicable: I (insert name of other parent)\n\nhereby consent to this designation.\n\n____________________ ______________________________\n\n(Date) (Signature of other parent)\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n(Address of other parent)\n\nI, (insert name of standby guardian) hereby accept my nomination as standby guardian of (insert minor(s)'s name(s)).

      "text": "(a) General rule.--The standby guardian shall have authority to act as coguardian or guardian upon the occurrence of the triggering event. The commencement of the standby guardian's authority to act as coguardian pursuant to a determination of incapacity, a determination of debilitation and consent or the receipt of consent alone shall not itself divest the designator of any parental rights but shall confer upon the standby guardian concurrent or shared custody of the child. The commencement of the standby guardian's authority to act as guardian pursuant to the death of the designator shall not confer upon the standby guardian more than physical and legal custody of the child as defined in Chapter 53 (relating to custody). A coguardian shall assure frequent and continuing contact with and physical access to the child and shall further assure the involvement of the parent, to include, to the greatest extent possible, in the decision making on behalf of the child.\n\n(b) Effect of filing.--The designator may file a petition for approval of a designation with the court at any time. If the petition is approved by the court before the occurrence of the triggering event, the standby guardian's authority will commence automatically upon the occurrence of the triggering event. No further petition or confirmation is necessary. If a designation has been made but the petition for approval of the designation has not been filed and a triggering event has occurred, the standby guardian shall have temporary legal authority to act as a coguardian or guardian of the minor without the direction of the court for a period of 60 days. The standby guardian shall within that period file a petition for approval in accordance with section 5612 (relating to petition for approval of a designation). If no petition is filed within the specified 60 days, the standby guardian shall lose all authority to act as coguardian or guardian. If a petition is filed but the court does not act upon it within the 60-day period, the temporary legal authority to act as coguardian or guardian shall continue until the court orders otherwise.\n\n(c) Parental rights.--The commencement of a coguardian's or guardian's authority under this subchapter may not itself divest a parent or legal guardian of any parental or guardianship rights.\n\n(d) Restored capacity.--If a licensed physician determines that the designator has regained capacity, the coguardian's authority which commenced pursuant to the occurrence of a triggering event shall become inactive, and the coguardian shall return to having no authority. Failure of a coguardian to comply with this provision and to immediately return the minor to the designator's care shall entitle the designator to an emergency hearing in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nReferences in Text.Former Chapter 53 (Custody), referred to in this section, is repealed. The subject matter is now contained in Chapter 53 (Child Custody).",

      "text": "(a) General rule.--Except as provided in subsection (b), a petition for court approval of a designation under this chapter may be made when an individual who is a custodial parent of a minor has entered a rehabilitation facility for treatment of a drug or alcohol addiction or has been subject to emergency medical intervention due to abuse of drugs or alcohol by filing with the court a copy of the designation.\n\n(b) Exception where designation has not been entered.--If a custodial parent has been subject to emergency medical intervention due to abuse of drugs or alcohol and a written designation has not been executed, a family member shall petition the court to hold a hearing to be designated temporary guardian. The petition, which shall require the notarized signature of the petitioner, shall be provided by the court in the following form:\n\nPetition for Temporary Guardianship without Consent of Parent\n\n(Insert Name, Address and Telephone Number of Family Member Petitioning for Temporary Guardianship and Relationship to Minor), HEREBY DECLARE MY INTENT TO BE APPOINTED TEMPORARY GUARDIAN OF ‌\n\n(Insert Name(s), Address(es) and Telephone Number(s) of Minor(s) for whom the appointment of temporary guardian is being sought) AS A RESULT OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL INTERVENTION RESULTING FROM ABUSE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL BY‌\n\n‌(Insert Name, Address and Telephone Number),\n\nFATHER/MOTHER TO‌\n\n(Insert Name(s) of Minor(s)), ON‌\n\n(Insert approximate date of the event).\n\nI HAVE NOTIFIED THE CHILD(REN)'S OTHER PARENT,‌\n\n(Insert Name, Address and Telephone Number), OF MY INTENT TO PETITION THIS COURT FOR TEMPORARY GUARDIANSHIP.\n\nI UNDERSTAND THAT FILING THIS PETITION DOES NOT REVOKE THE PARENTAL RIGHTS OF THE MINOR'S PARENT(S) NOR DOES IT GRANT ME ANY PARENTAL RIGHTS.\n\nI UNDERSTAND THAT MY RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS A TEMPORARY GUARDIAN TOWARD THE MINOR CHILD(REN) NAMED ABOVE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON THE COMPLETION OF A HEARING AND RENDERING OF A DECISION BY THE COURT.\n\nI UNDERSTAND THAT FILING FEES AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE WAIVED IF I DEMONSTRATE THE FEES AND OTHER COSTS WOULD CONSTITUTE A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO ME AND MY FAMILY.\n\nI HEREBY SWEAR OR AFFIRM THAT THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.\n\n(SIGNATURE OF PETITIONER)\n\n(c) Notice.--\n\n(1) The court shall notify a person named in the designation within 10 days of the filing of the petition and of any hearing on the petition.\n\n(2) If a designation has not been executed, the petitioner shall notify the custodial parent or parents, noncustodial parent or adoptive parent within 10 days of the filing of the petition and of any hearing on the petition.\n\n(3) If the petition alleges that a noncustodial parent cannot be located, that parent shall be notified in accordance with the notice provisions of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure in custody matters. No notice is necessary to a parent whose parental rights have previously been terminated or relinquished.\n\n(d) Jurisdiction.--For purposes of determining jurisdiction under this chapter, the provisions of Chapter 54 (relating to uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement) shall apply.\n\n(e) Presumptions.--In a proceeding for judicial appointment of a temporary guardian, a designation shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the designated temporary guardian is capable of serving as coguardian or guardian. When the designator is the sole surviving parent and when the parental rights of any noncustodial parent have been terminated or relinquished or when all parties consent to the designation, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that entry of the approval order is in the best interest of the child. In any case, if the court finds entry of the approval order to be in the best interests of the child, the court shall enter an order approving the designation petition.\n\n(f) Approval without hearing.--Approval of the designation without a hearing is permitted when the designator is the sole surviving parent, when the parental rights of a noncustodial parent have been terminated or relinquished or when all parties consent to entry of the approval order.\n\n(g) Hearing.--If a hearing is required, it shall be conducted in accordance with the proceedings under Chapters 53 (relating to child custody) and 54.\n\n(h) Court appearance.--If a designation has not been executed and a petition for temporary guardianship has been filed with the court by a family member, the custodial parent and noncustodial parent or adoptive parent shall appear in court in order to consent to or oppose the designation. If notice has been given under subsection (c)(3) and a noncustodial parent does not appear in court, it is presumed that consent to the designation has been granted.\n\n(i) Costs.--A court may waive filing fees and other costs upon application when the petitioner demonstrates the fees and other costs would constitute a financial burden upon the petitioner and the petitioner's family. There shall be a presumption of a financial burden if the income from all sources of the petitioner is less than 300% of the poverty level set by the Federal Government.\n\nCross References.Section 5622 is referred to in section 5623 of this title.",
