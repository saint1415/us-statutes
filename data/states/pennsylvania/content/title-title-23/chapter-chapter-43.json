      "text": "(a) General rule.--Where applicable under this section, a court may order either or both parents who are separated, divorced, unmarried or otherwise subject to an existing support obligation to provide equitably for educational costs of their child whether an application for this support is made before or after the child has reached 18 years of age. The responsibility to provide for postsecondary educational expenses is a shared responsibility between both parents. The duty of a parent to provide a postsecondary education for a child is not as exacting a requirement as the duty to provide food, clothing and shelter for a child of tender years unable to support himself. This authority shall extend to postsecondary education, including periods of undergraduate or vocational education after the child graduates from high school. An award for postsecondary educational costs may be entered only after the child or student has made reasonable efforts to apply for scholarships, grants and work-study assistance.\n\n(b) Action to recover educational expenses.--An action to recover educational costs may be commenced:\n\n(1) by the student if over 18 years of age; or\n\n(2) by either parent on behalf of a child under 18 years of age, but, if the student is over 18 years of age, the student's written consent to the action must be secured.\n\n(c) Calculation of educational costs.--In making an award under this section, the court shall calculate educational costs as defined in this section.\n\n(d) Grants and scholarships.--The court shall deduct from the educational costs all grants and scholarships awarded to the student.\n\n(e) Other relevant factors.--After calculating educational costs and deducting grants and scholarships, the court may order either parent or both parents to pay all or part of the remaining educational costs of their child. The court shall consider all relevant factors which appear reasonable, equitable and necessary, including the following:\n\n(1) The financial resources of both parents.\n\n(2) The financial resources of the student.\n\n(3) The receipt of educational loans and other financial assistance by the student.\n\n(4) The ability, willingness and desire of the student to pursue and complete the course of study.\n\n(5) Any willful estrangement between parent and student caused by the student after attaining majority.\n\n(6) The ability of the student to contribute to the student's expenses through gainful employment. The student's history of employment is material under this paragraph.\n\n(7) Any other relevant factors.\n\n(f) When liability may not be found.--A court shall not order support for educational costs if any of the following circumstances exist:\n\n(1) Undue financial hardship would result to the parent.\n\n(2) The educational costs would be a contribution for postcollege graduate educational costs.\n\n(3) The order would extend support for the student beyond the student's twenty-third birthday. If exceptional circumstances exist, the court may order educational support for the student beyond the student's twenty-third birthday.\n\n(g) Parent's obligation.--A parent's obligation to contribute toward the educational costs of a student shall not include payments to the other parent for the student's living expenses at home unless the student resides at home with the other parent and commutes to school.\n\n(h) Termination or modification of orders.--Any party may request modification or termination of an order entered under this section upon proof of change in educational status of the student, a material change in the financial status of any party or other relevant factors.\n\n(i) Applicability.--\n\n(1) This act shall apply to all divorce decrees, support agreements, support orders, agreed or stipulated court orders, property settlement agreements, equitable distribution agreements, custody agreements and/or court orders and agreed to or stipulated court orders in effect on, executed or entered since, November 12, 1992.\n\n(2) In addition, this act shall apply to all pending actions for support. This section shall not supersede or modify the express terms of a voluntary written marital settlement agreement or any court order entered pursuant thereto.\n\n(j) Definitions.--As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection:\n\n\"Educational costs.\" Tuition, fees, books, room, board and other educational materials.\n\n\"Postsecondary education.\" An educational or vocational program provided at a college, university or other postsecondary vocational, secretarial, business or technical school.\n\n(July 2, 1993, P.L.431, No.62, eff. imd.)\n\n1993 Amendment.Act 62 added section 4327.

      "text": "(a) Existing and certain future orders.--All orders of support existing as of the effective date of this provision, as well as all orders of support entered or modified after the effective date of this provision but before June 30, 1990, shall provide for mandatory attachment of income:\n\n(1) if the obligor is in arrears in payment in an amount equal to or greater than one month's support obligation;\n\n(2) at the request of the obligor;\n\n(3) at the request of the obligee; or\n\n(4) as of July 1, 1991, except as provided by subsection (b)(1) and (2).\n\n(b) Future orders.--All orders of support entered or modified on or after July 1, 1990, shall, as part of the order, provide for the mandatory attachment of income unless:\n\n(1) the obligor is not in arrears in payment in an amount equal to or greater of one month's support obligation; and\n\n(2) (i) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding; or\n\n(ii) a written agreement is reached between the parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.\n\nThe court may, on its own motion, order the attachment of the obligor's income where the court has a reasonable basis to believe the obligor will not comply with the order of support. In making this determination, the court may consider evidence of the person's previous violations of orders entered in any jurisdiction or evidence that the obligor has attempted to conceal income or to transfer, convey or encumber property in order to reduce the obligor's support obligation. Attachment shall occur under this subsection without amendment to the order of support and, if arrearages occur, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing.\n\n(c) Assessment of penalty.--The court may impose a penalty of not more than 10% on any amount in arrears for 30 days or more if the court determines that the arrearage was willful.\n\n(d) Arrearages.--If support arrearages exist at the time of the entry of the order, the order shall specify all of the following:\n\n(1) To whom an arrearage is owed and the amount of the arrearage.\n\n(2) The period of time for which the arrearage is calculated.\n\n(3) The amount of periodic support to be applied to current support and the amount to be applied to arrearages.\n\n(4) If support arrearages are owed to more than one obligee, how payments are to be divided and in which priority.\n\n(5) A direction that all payments are to be credited to current support obligations first, with any payment in excess to be applied to arrearages.\n\n(d.1) Insurance.--If an obligor or obligee is in violation of an order under section 4326(j)(3) (relating to mandatory inclusion of child medical support), the attachment shall be in favor of the appropriate provider of health care coverage.\n\n(e) Attachment process.--\n\n(1) The obligor shall be given notice of the attachment of his income. Such notice shall specify all of the following:\n\n(i) The amount to be withheld on account of current support and on account of arrears.\n\n(ii) That the order of attachment shall apply to current and future employers.\n\n(iii) That the grounds for contesting the order of attachment shall be limited to mistakes of fact. Mistakes of fact shall be limited to errors in the amount of current support owed, errors in the amount of arrearage, an attachment in excess of the maximum amount set forth in subsection (g) or mistaken identity of the obligor.\n\n(iv) That attachment has occurred or shall occur in all cases within ten days of the issuance of the notice.\n\n(v) A notice of how and when the order may be contested.\n\n(2) To contest the order, the obligor must appear before the domestic relations section no later than ten days after issuance of the notice, at which time it will be determined if a mistake of fact has occurred. If so, the order shall be modified accordingly.\n\n(f) Request of obligor.--The court shall also order the attachment of income where the obligor so requests.\n\n(g) Maximum amount.--The maximum amount of any attachment under this section shall not exceed the limits set forth in the Consumer Credit Protection Act (Public Law 90-321, 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.).\n\n(h) Termination.--The court may order the termination of an order of attachment in any of the following instances:\n\n(1) The support obligation has terminated and the total arrearages are paid.\n\n(2) Where the payee cannot be located and it becomes impossible to forward payments.\n\n(3) The result would be unconscionable.\n\n(i) Notice to employer.--The employer of an obligor shall be given notice of the attachment as provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure governing support. This notice shall include reference to subsections (g), (k), (l), (n) and (o) and all of the following:\n\n(1) The amount to be attached.\n\n(2) That the attachment shall be implemented as soon as possible and no later than 14 days from the issuance of the notice to the employer.\n\n(3) That the attachment payment must be sent to the domestic relations section or State disbursement unit, as appropriate, within seven business days of the date the obligor is paid.\n\n(4) That the attachment order is binding upon the employer until further notice.\n\n(5) That the employer may combine attachment payments into a single payment to the domestic relations section and separately identify the portions attributable to each obligor.\n\n(6) That the employer must notify the domestic relations section when the obligor terminates employment and provide his last known address and the new employer's name and address, if known.\n\n(j) Effect of compliance by employer.--Compliance by an employer with an order of attachment of income that is regular on its face operates as a discharge of the civil liability of the employer to the obligor as to that portion of the employment income of the obligor affected. An employer shall not be subject to criminal or civil liability to any individual or agency for conduct in compliance with the order. The employer may deduct from the income of the obligor a one-time fee of $50 for reimbursement of the expense in complying with the order. In no case shall the employer's reimbursement be deducted from the amount of the support order.\n\n(k) Effect of noncompliance by employer.--\n\n(1) An employer or officer or employee thereof who willfully fails to comply with an order of attachment under this chapter may, as prescribed by general rule, be adjudged in contempt and committed to jail or fined by the court.\n\n(2) The employer shall be liable for any amount the employer willfully fails to withhold from income due an employee under an order of attachment of income and any amount which is withheld from such income but not forwarded to the domestic relations office.\n\n(3) The court may, pursuant to general rule, attach funds or property of an employer.\n\n(l) Disciplinary action by employer prohibited.--\n\n(1) When an order of attachment on income withholding is about to be or has been entered, an employer or officer or employee thereof shall not use the attachment or possibility thereof as a basis, in whole or in part, for the refusal to employ or for the discharge of an employee or for any disciplinary action against or demotion of an employee. In case of a violation of this subsection, the employer or officer or employee thereof may be adjudged in contempt and committed to jail or fined by the court.\n\n(2) Any employee aggrieved by a violation of this subsection shall have the substantive right to bring an action for damages by reason of such violation in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(3) The department or a domestic relations section may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation against any employer that willfully violates the provisions of this subsection or that willfully fails to withhold income or to pay such amounts to the State disbursement unit.\n\n(m) Certify income.--Upon request of the domestic relations section, the employer shall report and certify the income of an employee.\n\n(n) Bonding.--The court may attach forms of income other than wages, assets, including spendthrift trusts, and private, public, State, county and municipal pensions, and include bonding or other requirements in cases involving obligors whose income is from sources other than wages, in order to assure that support owed by obligors in this Commonwealth will be collected without regard to the types of these obligors' income or the nature of their income-producing activities.\n\n(o) Priority of attachment.--(Deleted by amendment).\n\n(p) Nonresidents.--Income attachment shall be available to obligees residing outside this Commonwealth where the income of the obligor is derived in this Commonwealth.\n\n(q) Priority of attachment.--An order of attachment for support shall have priority over any attachment, execution, garnishment or wage assignment. The Supreme Court shall by general rule provide for priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld for multiple child support obligees received by an employer for the same obligor under this section and Chapter 75 (relating to direct enforcement of order of another state without registration).\n\n(r) Information requests.--\n\n(1) Upon the request of the department, a county domestic relations section or a child support agency of another state, any employer doing business within this Commonwealth, including a for-profit, not-for-profit or governmental employer, shall promptly provide information regarding the employment, compensation and benefits of any employee or contractor of the employer.\n\n(2) In addition to any other remedy allowed by law, the department may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation on an individual or entity that willfully fails to comply with a request for information under paragraph (1).\n\n(Dec. 20, 1989, P.L.654, No.81, eff. imd.; Dec. 4, 1992, P.L.757, No.114, eff. 90 days; Oct. 16, 1996, P.L.706, No.124, eff. 60 days; Dec. 16, 1997, P.L.549, No.58, eff.

      "text": "(a) General rule.--The court making an order of support shall at all times maintain jurisdiction of the matter for the purpose of enforcement of the order and for the purpose of increasing, decreasing, modifying or rescinding the order unless otherwise provided by Part VIII (relating to uniform interstate family support) or VIII-A (relating to intrastate family support) without limiting the right of the obligee, or the department if it has an assignment or other interest, to institute additional proceedings for support in any county in which the obligor resides or in which property of the obligor is situated. The Supreme Court shall by general rule establish procedures by which each interested party shall be notified of all proceedings in which support obligations might be established or modified and shall receive a copy of any order issued in a case within 14 days after issuance of such order. A petition for modification of a support order may be filed at any time and shall be granted if the requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances.\n\n(a.1) Automatic review.--Upon request of either parent, or automatically if there is an assignment under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.), each order of support shall be reviewed at least once every three years from the date of establishment or the most recent review. The review shall be for the purpose of making any appropriate increase, decrease, modification or rescission of the order. During the review, taking into the account the best interest of the child involved, the court shall adjust the order, without requiring proof of a change in circumstances, by applying the Statewide guidelines or a cost-of-living adjustment in accordance with a formula developed by general rule. Automated methods, including automated matches with wage or State income tax data, may be used to identify the support orders eligible for review and implement appropriate adjustments.\n\n(a.2) Effect of incarceration.--Incarceration, except incarceration for nonpayment of support, shall constitute a material and substantial change in circumstance that may warrant modification or termination of an order of support where the obligor lacks verifiable income or assets sufficient to enforce and collect amounts due.\n\n(b) Notice.--Each party subject to an automatic child support review shall receive:\n\n(1) thirty days' advance notice of the right of such party to request a review and adjustment of the order, except when the adjustment results from a cost-of-living adjustment or other automated adjustment;\n\n(2) a copy of any order establishing, modifying or rescinding a child support obligation or, in the case of a denied petition for modification, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the child support order, within 14 days after issuance of such order or determination; and\n\n(3) a 30-day period from the date of the notice of a cost-of-living adjustment or other automated adjustment to request an individual review and adjustment in accordance with the Statewide guideline.\n\n(c) Transfer of action.--Where neither party to the action resides or is employed in the county wherein the support action was filed, the court may transfer the matter to any county wherein either party resides or where the defendant is regularly employed. If one of the parties resides outside of this Commonwealth, the action may be transferred to the county of residence or employment of the other party.\n\n(d) Arrears as judgments.--On and after the date it is due, each and every support obligation shall constitute a judgment against the obligor by operation of law, with the full force, effect and attributes of a judgment of court, including the ability to be enforced, and shall be entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in this or any other state. Overdue support obligations of this or any other state which are on record at the county domestic relations section shall constitute a lien by operation of law against all real property owned by the obligor within the county as provided in subsection (d.1). The department shall develop and implement a system for providing notice to the public of liens arising out of overdue support obligations. The system and its procedures shall ensure convenient access to lien information and shall address hours of access by the business community and the general public and access via modem or automated means. Thirty days after publication of notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin that the system has been established, any lien on record shall constitute a lien against any real property in this Commonwealth owned by the obligor and shall also have the effect of a fully perfected security interest in personal property owned by the obligor in which a security interest can arise. The department shall consult with the Department of Transportation in the development of this system to enforce compliance with this subsection as it applies to liens on motor vehicles. The Supreme Court shall by general rule establish procedures for the recording of liens of other states at the county domestic relations section and for the enforcement of liens arising from overdue support without prior judicial notice or hearing. A bona fide good faith purchaser of personal property for value which is subject to a lien under this subsection acquires all title which the transferor had or had the power to transfer pursuant to 13 Pa.C.S. Ch. 24 (relating to title, creditors and good faith purchasers), and the obligee shall have all rights against such property which would be preserved to a fully perfected secured creditor under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9 (relating to secured transactions; sales of accounts, contract rights and chattel paper). The obligation for payment of arrears or overdue support shall terminate by operation of law when all arrears or overdue support has been paid.\n\n(d.1) Real property liens.--\n\n(1) Overdue support shall be a lien on real estate within the county in which the overdue support is on record at the county domestic relations section if:\n\n(i) the underlying support action is pending in the county domestic relations section or is being enforced by the county domestic relations section;\n\n(ii) notice of the existence of the support action is available to the public through a docket book or automated means; and\n\n(iii) the county domestic relations section is able to determine the amount of overdue support by reference to its records and is able to provide the amount of the overdue support upon request.\n\n(2) The priority and amount of a lien for overdue support shall be determined as follows:\n\n(i) The date of the lien for purposes of determining priority shall be determined separately for each unpaid overdue support payment. The date shall be the later of:\n\n(A) the date the obligor obtains a real property interest which may be subject to a lien;\n\n(B) the date the overdue support becomes a lien under paragraph (1); or\n\n(C) January 1, 1998.\n\n(ii) The amount of the lien on any date shall be the amount of overdue support shown on that date in the records of the domestic relations section.\n\n(3) Upon request of any person, the domestic relations section shall issue a written certification of the amount of overdue support owed by an individual as of the date of the certification and shall note on the docket the date of certification and the amount certified. The interests of any purchaser of real estate for value, mortgagee or other lienor that in good faith purchases the real estate or lends money on the security of the real estate and that records, within 30 days before or 60 days after the date of issuance of a certificate under this paragraph, a deed, mortgage or other encumbrance against the real estate shall not be subject to any lien for overdue support in excess of the amount shown on the certification.\n\n(4) The amount of overdue support owed by an obligor and the name of the obligor shall be public information and shall be deemed a public record subject to the act of June 21, 1957 (P.L.390, No.212), referred to as the Right-to-Know Law.\n\n(5) A lien arising from overdue support:\n\n(i) shall automatically attach to after-acquired property owned by the obligor;\n\n(ii) shall retain its priority without renewal or revival;\n\n(iii) shall continue to encumber the property upon sale or other transfer;\n\n(iv) shall not be divested upon a judicial sale or execution by a person with a lien with less priority;\n\n(v) shall not attach to the interest of any other co-owner in the property;\n\n(vi) shall expire 20 years after the due date of the last unsatisfied overdue support payment; and\n\n(vii) may be released by the court as against abandoned or distressed real property at the request of a governmental unit in order to facilitate the property's sale and rehabilitation.\n\n(6) The domestic relations section:\n\n(i) shall satisfy the lien promptly upon payment but no later than 60 days following receipt of the payment;\n\n(ii) may charge a fee not to exceed the lesser of its estimated cost of producing the report or $20 for the issuance of a lien certification or other written report of the overdue support obligations of an obligor;\n\n(iii) shall provide to the prothonotary of the county the identity of obligors and amount of overdue support to be used to make the information available to the public. The information shall be updated at least monthly and shall be provided by a paper listing, diskette or any other electronic means until the Statewide system under subsection (d) is implemented; and\n\n(iv) shall transmit at least every 60 days to credit bureaus directly or through the department reports and updates regarding the liens for overdue support.\n\n(7) The domestic relations section or employees thereof shall not be liable for errors in the certification of amounts of overdue support or satisfaction of liens for overdue support except as provided in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8550 (relating to willful misconduct).\n\n(8) Support may cease to be overdue if a revised payment schedule is established by the court, but any lien which has previously arisen against real estate shall remain in effect until paid or divested.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), the interests of any person who recorded a deed, mortgage or other instrument creating an interest in or lien against real estate on or after January 1, 1998, and before the effective date of this subsection shall not be subject to a lien for any overdue support accruing on or after the date the deed, mortgage or other instrument creating the interest or lien was recorded.\n\n(e) Retroactive modification of arrears.--No court shall modify or remit any support obligation, on or after the date it is due, except with respect to any period during which there is pending a petition for modification. If a petition for modification was filed, modification may be applied to the period beginning on the date that notice of such petition was given, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligee or, where the obligee was the petitioner, to the obligor. However, modification may be applied to an earlier period if the petitioner was precluded from filing a petition for modification by reason of a significant physical or mental disability, misrepresentation of another party or other compelling reason and if the petitioner, when no longer precluded, promptly filed a petition. In the case of an emancipated child, arrears shall not accrue from and after the date of the emancipation of the child for whose support the payment is made.\n\n(f) Foreign support orders.--(Deleted by amendment).\n\n(g) Notice to obligors and obligees.--The domestic relations section shall mail notice to obligors and obligees of existing orders informing them that such orders may attain the status of a judgment by operation of law. The notice shall explain the nature of a judgment by operation of law and its effect. Further, the notice shall advise each party to a support proceeding of the party's duty to advise the domestic relations section of material changes in circumstance and of the necessity to promptly request a modification as soon as circumstances change.\n\n(g.1) Nondisclosure of certain information.--If the court finds in an ex parte or other proceeding or if an existing order provides that the health, safety or liberty of a party or child would be unreasonably put at risk by the disclosure of identifying information, the court shall order that the address of the child or party or other identifying information not be disclosed in a pleading or other document filed in a proceeding under this part. Any court order under this subsection must be docketed in the domestic relations section.\n\n(g.2) Work activities.--If an obligor owes overdue support with respect to any child receiving cash or medical assistance, the court shall upon motion of the department or domestic relations section order that overdue support be paid in accordance with a plan approved by the court or that the obligor participate in work activities approved by the department. Work activities include:\n\n(1) Subsidized or unsubsidized public or private sector employment.\n\n(2) Work experience programs.\n\n(3) Work training programs.\n\n(4) Community service programs.\n\n(5) Job search requirements.\n\n(6) Job readiness programs.\n\n(7) Education directly related to employment.\n\n(8) Attendance at secondary school.\n\n(9) For a person who has not graduated high school, study leading to a high school diploma or equivalent.\n\n(g.3) Voidable transfers.--The court may void any voidable transfer by the obligor pursuant to 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 (relating to voidable transactions). It shall be a rebuttable presumption that a transfer by an obligor is voidable as to an obligee if the transfer was made for less than reasonably equivalent value and the transfer occurred after the initiation of a proceeding to establish or enforce support.\n\n(h) Applicability.--This section applies to all support orders whether entered under this chapter or any other statute.\n\n(Mar. 25, 1988, P.L.296, No.35, eff. imd.; Dec. 20, 1989, P.L.654, No.81, eff. imd.; Apr. 4, 1996, P.L.58, No.20, eff. imd.; Dec. 16, 1997, P.L.549, No.58, eff.
