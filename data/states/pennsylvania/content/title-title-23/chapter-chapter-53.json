      "text": "(a) Types of award.--After considering the factors set forth in section 5328 (relating to factors to consider when awarding custody), the court may award any of the following types of custody if it is in the best interest of the child:\n\n(1) Shared physical custody.\n\n(2) Primary physical custody.\n\n(3) Partial physical custody.\n\n(4) Sole physical custody.\n\n(5) Supervised physical custody.\n\n(6) Shared legal custody.\n\n(7) Sole legal custody.\n\n(b) Interim award.--The court may issue an interim award of custody to a party who has standing under section 5324 (relating to standing for any form of physical custody or legal custody) or 5325 (relating to standing for partial physical custody and supervised physical custody) in the manner prescribed by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing special relief in custody matters.\n\n(c) Notice.--Any custody order shall include notice of a party's obligations under section 5337 (relating to relocation).\n\n(d) Reasons for award.--The court shall delineate the reasons for its decision on the record in open court or in a written opinion or order.\n\n(e) Safety conditions.--\n\n(1) After considering the factors under sections 5328, 5329 (relating to consideration of criminal conviction), 5329.1 (relating to consideration of child abuse and involvement with protective services) and 5330 (relating to consideration of criminal charge), if the court finds a history of abuse of the child or a household member by a party or a present risk of harm to the child or an abused party and awards any form of custody to a party who committed the abuse or who has a household member who committed the abuse, the court shall include in the custody order:\n\n(i) The safety conditions, restrictions or safeguards as reasonably necessary to protect the child or the abused party.\n\n(ii) The reason for imposing the safety conditions, restrictions or safeguards, including an explanation why the safety conditions, restrictions or safeguards are in the best interest of the child or the abused party.\n\n(iii) The reasons why unsupervised physical custody is in the best interest of the child if the court finds that past abuse was committed by a party.\n\n(2) If supervised contact is ordered, there shall be a review of the risk of harm and need for continued supervision upon petition of the party. The safety conditions, restrictions or safeguards may include any of the following:\n\n(i) Nonprofessional supervised physical custody.\n\n(ii) Professional supervised physical custody.\n\n(iii) Limitations on the time of day that physical custody is permitted or on the number of hours of physical custody and the maximum number of hours of physical custody permitted per day or per week.\n\n(iv) The appointment of a qualified professional specializing in programming relating to the history of abuse or risk of harm to provide batterer's intervention and harm prevention programming. Batterer's intervention and harm prevention programming may include programming designed to rehabilitate the offending individual, including prioritizing a batterer's intervention and harm prevention program, if available, or the impacts of physical, sexual or domestic abuse on the victim. The court may order an evaluation by the appointed qualified professional under this paragraph to determine whether additional programming is necessary.\n\n(v) Limitations on legal custody.\n\n(vi) Any other safety condition, restriction or safeguard as necessary to ensure the safety of the child or to protect a household member.\n\n(e.1) Supervised physical custody.--If a court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there is an ongoing risk of abuse of the child, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the court shall only allow supervised physical custody between the child and the party who poses the risk of abuse. A court may find that an indicated report for physical or sexual abuse under Chapter 63 (relating to child protective services) is a basis for a finding of abuse under this subsection only after a de novo review of the circumstances leading to the indicated report. When awarding supervised physical custody under this subsection, the court shall favor professional supervised physical custody. The court may award nonprofessional supervised physical custody if:\n\n(1) the court determines that professional supervised physical custody is not available within a reasonable distance of the parties or the court determines that the party requiring supervised physical custody is unable to pay for the professional supervised physical custody; and\n\n(2) the court designates an adult to supervise the custodial visits who has appeared in person before the court, the individual executes an affidavit of accountability and the court makes finding, on the record, that the individual is capable of promoting the safety of the child.\n\n(f) Enforcement.--In awarding custody, the court shall specify the terms and conditions of the award in sufficient detail to enable a party to enforce the court order through law enforcement authorities.\n\n(g) Contempt for noncompliance with any custody order.--\n\n(1) A party who willfully fails to comply with any custody order may, as prescribed by general rule, be adjudged in contempt. Contempt shall be punishable by any one or more of the following:\n\n(i) Imprisonment for a period of not more than six months.\n\n(ii) A fine of not more than $500.\n\n(iii) Probation for a period of not more than six months.\n\n(iv) An order for nonrenewal, suspension or denial of operating privilege under section 4355 (relating to denial or suspension of licenses).\n\n(v) Counsel fees and costs.\n\n(2) An order committing an individual to jail under this section shall specify the condition which, when fulfilled, will result in the release of that individual.\n\n(h) Parties in same residence.--Parties living separate and apart in the same residence may seek relief under this chapter, but any custody order made under such a circumstance shall be effective only upon:\n\n(1) one party physically vacating the residence; or\n\n(2) an order awarding one party exclusive possession of the residence.\n\n(Apr. 15, 2024, P.L.24, No.8, eff. 120 days)\n\n2024 Amendment.Act 8 amended subsec.

If a counter-affidavit regarding relocation is filed with the court which indicates the nonrelocating party objects either to the proposed relocation or to the modification of the custody order consistent with the proposal for revised custody schedule, the court shall modify the existing custody order only after holding a hearing to establish the terms and conditions of the order pursuant to the relocation indicating the rights, if any, of the nonrelocating parties.\n\n(g) Hearing.--\n\n(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (3), the court shall hold an expedited full hearing on the proposed relocation after a timely objection has been filed and before the relocation occurs.\n\n(2) Except as set forth in paragraph (3), the court may, on its own motion, hold an expedited full hearing on the proposed relocation before the relocation occurs.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), if the court finds that exigent circumstances exist, the court may approve the relocation pending an expedited full hearing.\n\n(4) If the court approves the proposed relocation, it shall:\n\n(i) modify any existing custody order; or\n\n(ii) establish the terms and conditions of a custody order.\n\n(h) Relocation factors.--In determining whether to grant a proposed relocation, the court shall consider the following factors, giving weighted consideration to those factors which affect the safety of the child:\n\n(1) The nature, quality, extent of involvement and duration of the child's relationship with the party proposing to relocate and with the nonrelocating party, siblings and other significant persons in the child's life.\n\n(2) The age, developmental stage, needs of the child and the likely impact the relocation will have on the child's physical, educational and emotional development, taking into consideration any special needs of the child.\n\n(3) The feasibility of preserving the relationship between the nonrelocating party and the child through suitable custody arrangements, considering the logistics and financial circumstances of the parties.\n\n(4) The child's preference, taking into consideration the age and maturity of the child.\n\n(5) Whether there is an established pattern of conduct of either party to promote or thwart the relationship of the child and the other party.\n\n(6) Whether the relocation will enhance the general quality of life for the party seeking the relocation, including, but not limited to, financial or emotional benefit or educational opportunity.\n\n(7) Whether the relocation will enhance the general quality of life for the child, including, but not limited to, financial or emotional benefit or educational opportunity.\n\n(8) The reasons and motivation of each party for seeking or opposing the relocation.\n\n(9) The present and past abuse committed by a party or member of the party's household and whether there is a continued risk of harm to the child or an abused party.\n\n(10) Any other factor affecting the best interest of the child.\n\n(i) Burden of proof.--\n\n(1) The party proposing the relocation has the burden of establishing that the relocation will serve the best interest of the child as shown under the factors set forth in subsection (h).\n\n(2) Each party has the burden of establishing the integrity of that party's motives in either seeking the relocation or seeking to prevent the relocation.\n\n(j) Failure to provide reasonable notice.--The court may consider a failure to provide reasonable notice of a proposed relocation as:\n\n(1) a factor in making a determination regarding the relocation;\n\n(2) a factor in determining whether custody rights should be modified;\n\n(3) a basis for ordering the return of the child to the nonrelocating party if the relocation has occurred without reasonable notice;\n\n(4) sufficient cause to order the party proposing the relocation to pay reasonable expenses and counsel fees incurred by the party objecting to the relocation; and\n\n(5) a ground for contempt and the imposition of sanctions against the party proposing the relocation.\n\n(k) Mitigation.--Any consideration of a failure to provide reasonable notice under subsection (i) shall be subject to mitigation if the court determines that such failure was caused in whole, or in part, by abuse.\n\n(l) Effect of relocation prior to hearing.--If a party relocates with the child prior to a full expedited hearing, the court shall not confer any presumption in favor of the relocation.\n\nCross References.Section 5337 is referred to in section 5323 of this title.",
