      "text": "(a) General rule.--As used in this chapter, \"marital property\" means all property acquired by either party during the marriage and the increase in value of any nonmarital property acquired pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (3) as measured and determined under subsection (a.1). However, marital property does not include:\n\n(1) Property acquired prior to marriage or property acquired in exchange for property acquired prior to the marriage.\n\n(2) Property excluded by valid agreement of the parties entered into before, during or after the marriage.\n\n(3) Property acquired by gift, except between spouses, bequest, devise or descent or property acquired in exchange for such property.\n\n(4) Property acquired after final separation until the date of divorce, except for property acquired in exchange for marital assets.\n\n(5) Property which a party has sold, granted, conveyed or otherwise disposed of in good faith and for value prior to the date of final separation.\n\n(6) Veterans' benefits exempt from attachment, levy or seizure pursuant to the act of September 2, 1958 (Public Law 85-857, 72 Stat. 1229), as amended, except for those benefits received by a veteran where the veteran has waived a portion of his military retirement pay in order to receive veterans' compensation.\n\n(7) Property to the extent to which the property has been mortgaged or otherwise encumbered in good faith for value prior to the date of final separation.\n\n(8) Any payment received as a result of an award or settlement for any cause of action or claim which accrued prior to the marriage or after the date of final separation regardless of when the payment was received.\n\n(a.1) Measuring and determining the increase in value of nonmarital property.--The increase in value of any nonmarital property acquired pursuant to subsection (a)(1) and (3) shall be measured from the date of marriage or later acquisition date to either the date of final separation or the date as close to the hearing on equitable distribution as possible, whichever date results in a lesser increase. Any decrease in value of the nonmarital property of a party shall be offset against any increase in value of the nonmarital property of that party. However, a decrease in value of the nonmarital property of a party shall not be offset against any increase in value of the nonmarital property of the other party or against any other marital property subject to equitable division.\n\n(b) Presumption.--All real or personal property acquired by either party during the marriage is presumed to be marital property regardless of whether title is held individually or by the parties in some form of co-ownership such as joint tenancy, tenancy in common or tenancy by the entirety. The presumption of marital property is overcome by a showing that the property was acquired by a method listed in subsection (a).\n\n(c) Defined benefit retirement plans.--Notwithstanding subsections (a), (a.1) and (b):\n\n(1) In the case of the marital portion of a defined benefit retirement plan being distributed by means of a deferred distribution, the defined benefit plan shall be allocated between its marital and nonmarital portions solely by use of a coverture fraction. The denominator of the coverture fraction shall be the number of months the employee spouse worked to earn the total benefit and the numerator shall be the number of such months during which the parties were married and not finally separated. The benefit to which the coverture fraction is applied shall include all postseparation enhancements except for enhancements arising from postseparation monetary contributions made by the employee spouse, including the gain or loss on such contributions.\n\n(2) In the case of the marital portion of a defined benefit retirement plan being distributed by means of an immediate offset, the defined benefit plan shall be allocated between its marital and nonmarital portions solely by use of a coverture fraction. The denominator of the coverture fraction shall be the number of months the employee spouse worked to earn the accrued benefit as of a date as close to the time of trial as reasonably possible and the numerator shall be the number of such months during which the parties were married and not finally separated. The benefit to which the coverture fraction is applied shall include all postseparation enhancements up to a date as close to the time of trial as reasonably possible except for enhancements arising from postseparation monetary contributions made by the employee spouse, including the gain or loss on such contributions.\n\n(Nov. 29, 2004, P.L.1357, No.175, eff. 60 days)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 175 amended subsec. (a) and added subsecs. (a.1) and (c). See section 5(6) of Act 175 in the appendix to this title for special provisions relating to applicability.\n\nEquitable Distribution Proceedings.Section 1 of Act 4 of 2005 provided that subsec. (c) shall apply to all equitable distribution proceedings pending on or after the effective date of section 1.",

      "text": "(a) General rule.--Upon the request of either party in an action for divorce or annulment, the court shall equitably divide, distribute or assign, in kind or otherwise, the marital property between the parties without regard to marital misconduct in such percentages and in such manner as the court deems just after considering all relevant factors. The court may consider each marital asset or group of assets independently and apply a different percentage to each marital asset or group of assets. Factors which are relevant to the equitable division of marital property include the following:\n\n(1) The length of the marriage.\n\n(2) Any prior marriage of either party.\n\n(3) The age, health, station, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties.\n\n(4) The contribution by one party to the education, training or increased earning power of the other party.\n\n(5) The opportunity of each party for future acquisitions of capital assets and income.\n\n(6) The sources of income of both parties, including, but not limited to, medical, retirement, insurance or other benefits.\n\n(7) The contribution or dissipation of each party in the acquisition, preservation, depreciation or appreciation of the marital property, including the contribution of a party as homemaker.\n\n(8) The value of the property set apart to each party.\n\n(9) The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage.\n\n(10) The economic circumstances of each party at the time the division of property is to become effective.\n\n(10.1) The Federal, State and local tax ramifications associated with each asset to be divided, distributed or assigned, which ramifications need not be immediate and certain.\n\n(10.2) The expense of sale, transfer or liquidation associated with a particular asset, which expense need not be immediate and certain.\n\n(11) Whether the party will be serving as the custodian of any dependent minor children.\n\n(b) Lien.--The court may impose a lien or charge upon property of a party as security for the payment of alimony or any other award for the other party.\n\n(c) Family home.--The court may award, during the pendency of the action or otherwise, to one or both of the parties the right to reside in the marital residence.\n\n(d) Life insurance.--The court may direct the continued maintenance and beneficiary designations of existing policies insuring the life or health of either party which were originally purchased during the marriage and owned by or within the effective control of either party. Where it is necessary to protect the interests of a party, the court may also direct the purchase of, and beneficiary designations on, a policy insuring the life or health of either party.\n\n(e) Powers of the court.--If, at any time, a party has failed to comply with an order of equitable distribution, as provided for in this chapter or with the terms of an agreement as entered into between the parties, after hearing, the court may, in addition to any other remedy available under this part, in order to effect compliance with its order:\n\n(1) enter judgment;\n\n(2) authorize the taking and seizure of the goods and chattels and collection of the rents and profits of the real and personal, tangible and intangible property of the party;\n\n(3) award interest on unpaid installments;\n\n(4) order and direct the transfer or sale of any property required in order to comply with the court's order;\n\n(5) require security to insure future payments in compliance with the court's order;\n\n(6) issue attachment proceedings, directed to the sheriff or other proper officer of the county, directing that the person named as having failed to comply with the court order be brought before the court, at such time as the court may direct. If the court finds, after hearing, that the person willfully failed to comply with the court order, it may deem the person in civil contempt of court and, in its discretion, make an appropriate order, including, but not limited to, commitment of the person to the county jail for a period not to exceed six months;\n\n(7) award counsel fees and costs;\n\n(8) attach wages; or\n\n(9) find the party in contempt.\n\n(f) Partial distribution.--The court, upon the request of either party, may at any stage of the proceedings enter an order providing for an interim partial distribution or assignment of marital property.\n\n(Nov. 29, 2004, P.L.1357, No.175, eff. 60 days)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 175 amended subsec. (a) and added subsec. (f). See section 5(8) and (9) of Act 175 in the appendix to this title for special provisions relating to applicability.",

The party in whose name the assets are held shall be declared the constructive trustee unless the court designates a different trustee, and the trust may include any terms and conditions the court may determine.
