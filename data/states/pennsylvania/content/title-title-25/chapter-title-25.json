(b) Procedure.-- The commission, upon application by a public utility, person or corporation which has agreed to acquire property from another public utility, municipal corporation or person, may approve an inclusion in rate base in accordance with subsection (a) prior to the acquisition and prior to a proceeding under this subchapter to determine just and reasonable rates if: (1) the applicant has provided notice of the proposed acquisition and any proposed increase in rates to the customers served by the property to be acquired, in such form and manner as the commission, by regulation, shall require; (2) the applicant has provided notice to its customers, in such form and manner as the commission, by regulation, shall require, if the proposed acquisition would increase rates to the acquiring public utility's customers by an amount in excess of 1% of the acquiring public utility's base annual revenue; (3) the applicant has provided notice of the application to the Director of Trial Staff and the Consumer Advocate; and (4) in addition to any other information required by the commission, the application includes a full description of the proposed acquisition and a plan for reasonable and prudent investments to assure that the customers served by the property to be acquired will receive adequate, efficient, safe and reasonable service.

(e) Acquisition cost lower than depreciated original cost.-- If a public utility acquires property from another public utility, a municipal corporation or a person at a cost which is lower than the original cost of the property when first devoted to the public service less the applicable accrued depreciation and the property is used and useful in providing water or sewer service, that difference shall, absent matters of a substantial public interest, be amortized as an addition to income over a reasonable period of time or be passed through to the ratepayers by such other methodology as the commission may direct. Notice of the proposed treatment of an acquisition cost lower than depreciated original cost shall be given to the Director of Trial Staff and the Consumer Advocate. (f) Reports.-- The commission shall annually transmit to the Governor and to the General Assembly and shall make available to the public a report on the acquisition activity under this title.

Program participants in the Address Confidentiality Program under 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 67 (relating to domestic and sexual violence victim address confidentiality) may use a substitute address designated by the Office of Victim Advocate as their address. Personal medical data and other information for use in an emergency may be included as a part of the license. Information other than that required to identify the licensee, the distinguishing number and the class of license issued may be included in microdata form. Except as provided in subsection (f), an applicant shall include his Social Security number on his license application, but the Social Security number shall not be included on the license. No driver's license shall be valid until it has been signed by the licensee. (a.1) Veteran's driver's license designation.-- (1) Beginning as soon as practicable, but no later than 18 months following the effective date of this subsection, the department shall issue a driver's license or identification card that clearly indicates that the person is a veteran of the United States Armed Forces. A qualified applicant is an individual who has served in the United States Armed Forces, including a reserve component or the National Guard, and who was discharged or released from such service under conditions other than dishonorable. (2) Upon receipt of an application from a qualified applicant accompanied by such documentation as the department shall require, the department shall independently validate the documentation and immediately issue to the veteran a driver's license or identification card displaying a veteran designation without submitting the application or documentation to the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs for review, approval or validation. There shall be no fee for the veteran designation, but the qualified applicant must pay any renewal or duplicate driver's license or identification card fees. (3) The department and the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall enter into an agreement whereby the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall reimburse the Motor License Fund for the department's actual costs of the issuance of a veteran's designation on drivers' licenses and identification cards. Reimbursement shall be paid from the Veterans' Trust Fund or such other funds available for this purpose. (4) A person who falsely represents himself as a veteran of the United States Armed Forces on an application for a driver's license or identification card is subject to the penalty under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904(b) (relating to unsworn falsification to authorities). (b) Identification card.-- The department shall, upon payment of the required fee, issue an identification card to any person ten years of age or older who has made application therefor in such manner as the department shall prescribe or whose driver's license has been surrendered to the department because of a suspension or revocation of an operating privilege under this or any other title. Program participants in the Address Confidentiality Program under 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 67 may use a substitute address designated by the Office of Victim Advocate as their address. Except as provided in subsection (j), the identification card shall have substantially the same content as a driver's license but shall clearly indicate that it is not a driver's license.

(c) Anatomical donors.-- Any person who is registered as an anatomical organ donor and who has in his possession a card issued by the recipient organization may attach the card to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card in such a way as to permit the removal of this card should the person no longer desire to be designated as an anatomical donor. Any person may also attach to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card a symbol provided by the Department of Health designating a person to be an anatomical donor. The department shall distribute such symbols at all photo license centers and shall make such symbols available in quantity to any political subdivision or organization on request. Information concerning registered donor status may be included as a part of the person's personal medical data. (d) Medical history record.-- Any person may attach to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card information relating to his personal medical history. (e) Use of identification cards.-- If a person has an established policy of accepting a driver's license issued pursuant to subsection (a) for the purpose of identification for the acceptance of a check given for payment of purchase or for the cashing of a check, the person shall also accept an identification card issued pursuant to subsection (b) for the same purpose. It shall be a defense to a prosecution under this subsection that the person was not presented with notice of the provisions of this subsection. (f) Waiver.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the department shall issue a driver's license to an otherwise eligible person who has no Social Security number if the person submits a waiver obtained from the Federal Government permitting him not to have a Social Security number. The department may require other identifiers, including, but not limited to, a taxpayer identification number, before issuing the license. (g) Completion of process.-- (1) For purposes of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-31, 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg et seq.), this subsection applies to statutes requiring determination of completion of the licensing process. (2) The process of issuing a driver's license is complete when a license bearing the licensee's photograph, photographic facsimile or image has been issued by the department. (h) Sale of photographs prohibited.-- Neither the department nor any person under contract with the department shall sell photographs of holders of a driver's license or identification card for any commercial purpose. (i) Issuance to noncitizens.-- A license issued in accordance with section 1506(a.1) (relating to application for driver's license or learner's permit) may contain an indication that the license was issued to the person who is not a citizen of the United States and who has credentials or documents issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service or its successor. (j) Undercover credential.-- The department may issue an undercover credential to Federal, State or local law enforcement officials. The department may establish guidelines concerning the issuance of such undercover credentials and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of these licenses and their issuance.

(c) Distribution formula.-- (1) No later than 15 business days after the effective date of this section, the department shall forward to the Legislative Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin the base operating allocation for each local transportation organization. (1.1) For purposes of determining the amount of assistance available for distribution under this subsection, in addition to the amounts allocated under section 1506(e)(1)(relating to fund), an amount equal to the revenue in the Public Transportation Assistance Fund dedicated pursuant to law shall be included. (2) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, each qualifying local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance which shall consist of the following: (i) Its base operating allocation multiplied by 1.0506. (ii) An additional amount which shall be allocated based on the following distribution formula: (A) Twenty-five percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of passengers.

(II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of revenue vehicle miles. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of revenue vehicle miles for all local transportation organizations. (3) For the 2007-2008 fiscal year, no local transportation organization shall receive total financial assistance under this subsection that would be more than 50% higher than the amount it receives under paragraph (2)(i). For each subsequent fiscal year, the increase in the total financial assistance provided to each local transportation organization shall not exceed 20% of the prior year allocation. (c.1) Minimum.-- No local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance under this section in an amount less than the amount received in the previous fiscal year. (d) Local match requirements.-- (1) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, except as provided under paragraph (2), financial assistance provided under this section shall be matched by local or private cash funding in an amount not less than the greater of: (i) 15% of the amount of the financial assistance being provided; or (ii) the amount required under former section 1311(d) (relating to use of funds distributed) for fiscal year 2006-2007. (2) Beginning in fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, if the local matching funds provided are less than 15% of the amount of financial assistance received, the local transportation organization's required local matching funds shall increase annually in order to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). The local matching funds shall be increased annually by a minimum of 5% above the amount of local matching funds provided in the previous fiscal year unless a lesser amount is necessary to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). (3) Eligible local matching funds shall consist only of cash contributions provided by one or more municipalities or counties. The amount of the match and the time period during which the match must continue to be available shall be specified in the financial assistance agreement. Funding provided by local and private entities, including advertising or naming rights, may qualify as local matching funds to the extent they provide for the cost of transit service that is open to the public. The following shall not be considered local matching funds: (i) Any form of transit operating revenue or other forms of transit income provided by the local transportation organization. (ii) Funds used to replace fares. (4) A municipality in a metropolitan area which is a member of a local transportation organization is authorized to provide annual financial assistance from current revenues to the local transportation organization of which it is a member or enter into a long-term agreement for payment of money to assist in defraying the costs of operation, maintenance and debt service of the local transportation organization or of a particular public transportation project of a local transportation organization. The obligation of a municipality under an agreement pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered to be a part of the indebtedness of the municipality, nor shall the obligation be deemed to impair the status of any indebtedness of the municipality which would otherwise be considered self-sustaining. (e) Performance reviews.-- (1) The department may conduct performance reviews of an award recipient under this section to determine the effectiveness of the financial assistance. Reviews shall be conducted at regular intervals as established by the department in consultation with the management of the award recipient. After completion of a review, the department shall issue a report that: (i) highlights exceptional performance and identifies any problems that need to be resolved; (ii) assesses performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of the financial assistance; (iii) makes recommendations on follow-up actions required to remedy any problem identified; and (iv) provides an action plan documenting who should perform the recommended actions and a time frame within which they should be performed. (2) The department shall deliver the report to the Governor, to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the Senate and to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives. The department's regulations shall contain a description of the impact on both the amount of, and future eligibility for, financial assistance under this chapter based upon the degree to which the local transportation organization complies with the recommendations in the report. The department shall develop a list of best practices revealed by the reports issued under this subsection and shall post them on the department's Internet website. (f) Performance criteria.-- Criteria used for the reviews conducted under subsection (e) shall consist of passengers per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per revenue vehicle hour, operating revenue per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per passenger and other items as the department may establish. The department's regulations shall set forth the minimum system performance criteria based upon comparison of the award recipient to its past performance and to its peers that an award recipient must satisfy. (g) Failure to satisfy minimum performance criteria.-- (1) If a performance review conducted under subsection (e) reveals that the performance of an award recipient's transportation system has decreased compared to performance determined through a prior review, the department may, upon the written request of an award recipient, waive any requirement for a reduction in the amount of financial assistance to be awarded under this section for a reasonable time period to allow the award recipient to bring the system back to the required performance level. The award recipient shall provide written justification for providing a time period longer than two years. In order to obtain the waiver for the period requested, the award recipient must do all of the following: (i) Develop an action plan to improve system performance that contains key measurable milestones. The action plan must be acceptable to the department and must be approved by the department in writing. (ii) Submit quarterly progress reports on the action plan to the department. (2) The department shall review and evaluate the award recipient's progress to determine if the system has improved. If the system has improved, the award recipient will remain eligible for full formula funding as determined under subsection (c). If the system has not improved by the end of the waiver period, the waiver will be withdrawn. Expenses incurred by the award recipient as a result of the failure of the award recipient's system to meet the minimum performance criteria shall be borne by the award recipient. (h) Adjustments to minimum performance criteria.-- Upon written request of an award recipient, the department may adjust the minimum performance criteria described in subsection (g) in a given year if the performance of the award recipient's system is adversely affected by circumstances which are beyond the award recipient's control. Examples are labor strikes, infrastructure failures and natural disasters. The request must include the award recipient's reasons for seeking the adjustment. Cross References.

(b) Examination of applicants for renewal.-- The department may require persons applying for renewal of a driver's license to take and successfully pass a physical examination or a vision examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist, or both examinations, if the department has reason to believe, either based on knowledge of the person or on statistical inference, that the person may be a traffic safety hazard.

A driver's license which otherwise would have expired under subsection (a) shall be valid only if the licensee has in immediate possession, together with the driver's license, papers indicating actual service outside this Commonwealth, or discharge or separation, as the case may be, or proof thereof if a spouse or child. (e) Noncitizen license expiration and renewal.-- (1) Except as otherwise provided, a license issued on the basis of Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) credentials or documents shall expire on the date appearing on the INS credentials or documents provided by the applicant under section 1506(a.1) (relating to application for driver's license or learner's permit). (2) If the expiration date of the INS credentials or documents exceeds four years, the license shall expire one day after the applicant's date of birth but not more than four years from the date of issuance of the license.

The notice shall be a standardized form adopted by the commissioner and shall include the following language: NOTICE TO NAMED INSUREDS A. \"Limited Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania give you the right to choose a form of insurance that limits your right and the right of members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses, but not for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages unless the injuries suffered fall within the definition of \"serious injury\" as set forth in the policy or unless one of several other exceptions noted in the policy applies. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"limited tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. B. \"Full Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also give you the right to choose a form of insurance under which you maintain an unrestricted right for you and the members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses and may also seek financial compensation for pain and suffering and other nonmonetary damages as a result of injuries caused by other drivers. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"full tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. C. You may contact your insurance agent, broker or company to discuss the cost of other coverages. D. If you wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A, you must sign this notice where indicated below and return it. If you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date E. If you wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B, you may sign this notice where indicated below and return it. However, if you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date (2) Insurers shall print the above notice containing both options on one sheet in prominent type and place in a prominent location. Any person signing, or otherwise bound by, a document containing such terms is bound by such election and is precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed in making the election between full tort or limited tort alternatives. Where there are two or more named insureds on a policy, any named insured may make the full or limited tort election provided for in this section for all named insureds on the policy. (3) If a named insured who receives a notice under paragraph (1) does not indicate a choice within 20 days, the insurer shall send a second notice. The second notice shall be in a form identical to the first notice, except that it shall be identified as a second and final notice. If a named insured has not responded to either notice ten days prior to the renewal date, the named insured and those he is empowered by this section to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. All notices required by this section shall advise that if no tort election is made, the named insured and those he is empowered to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. Any person subject to the limited tort option by virtue of this section shall be precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed. (4) Each insurer, prior to the first issuance of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall provide each applicant with the notice required by paragraph (1). A policy may not be issued until the applicant has been provided an opportunity to elect a tort option. (5) An owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle who does not have financial responsibility shall be deemed to have chosen the limited tort alternative. (6) Nothing in this section changes or modifies the existing requirement that owners of registered vehicles maintain bodily injury and property damage liability insurance arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. (b) Application of tort options.-- (1) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all private passenger motor vehicle policies of the named insured issued by the same insurer and shall continue in force as to all subsequent renewal policies, replacement policies and any other private passenger motor vehicle policies under which the individual is a named insured until the insurer, or its authorized representative, receives a properly executed form electing the other tort option. (2) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all insureds under the private passenger motor vehicle policy who are not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy. In the case where more than one private passenger motor vehicle policy is applicable to an insured and the policies have conflicting tort options, the insured is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the private passenger motor vehicle in which the insured is an occupant at the time of the accident if he is an insured on that policy and bound by the full tort option otherwise. (3) An individual who is not an owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle and who is not a named insured or insured under any private passenger motor vehicle policy shall not be precluded from maintaining an action for noneconomic loss or economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (c) Full tort alternative.-- Each person who is bound by the full tort election remains eligible to seek compensation for noneconomic loss claimed and economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (d) Limited tort alternative.-- Each person who elects the limited tort alternative remains eligible to seek compensation for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. Unless the injury sustained is a serious injury, each person who is bound by the limited tort election shall be precluded from maintaining an action for any noneconomic loss, except that: (1) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election who sustains damages in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person may recover damages as if the individual damaged had elected the full tort alternative whenever the person at fault: (i) is convicted or accepts Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in that accident; (ii) is operating a motor vehicle registered in another state; (iii) intends to injure himself or another person, provided that an individual does not intentionally injure himself or another person merely because his act or failure to act is intentional or done with his realization that it creates a grave risk of causing injury or the act or omission causing the injury is for the purpose of averting bodily harm to himself or another person; or (iv) has not maintained financial responsibility as required by this chapter, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall affect the limitation of section 1731(d)(2) (relating to availability, scope and amount of coverage). (2) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights with respect to claims against a person in the business of designing, manufacturing, repairing, servicing or otherwise maintaining motor vehicles arising out of a defect in such motor vehicle which is caused by or not corrected by an act or omission in the course of such business, other than a defect in a motor vehicle which is operated by such business. (3) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights if injured while an occupant of a motor vehicle other than a private passenger motor vehicle. (e) Nondiscrimination.-- No insurer shall cancel, refuse to write or refuse to renew a motor vehicle insurance policy based on the tort option election of the named insured. Any violation of this subsection shall be deemed a violation of the Automobile Insurance Policy Act. (f) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases when used in this section shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Insured.\" Any individual residing in the household of the named insured who is: (1) a spouse or other relative of the named insured; or (2) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured. \"Named insured.\" Any individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.
