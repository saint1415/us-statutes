If mailed, the notice must be postmarked not later than the deadline for registration or, in the case of an illegible or missing postmark, received within five days of the close of registration.\n\n(b) Use.--A registered elector who removes residence from one place to another within the same county must notify the commission by filing a removal notice under subsection (a) or a signed request for renewal that contains the information required in subsection (a) with the commission not later than the registration deadline before an election. If mailed, the notice or request must be postmarked not later than the deadline for registration or, in the case of an illegible or missing postmark, received within five days of the close of registration. The following apply:\n\n(1) An official registration application of an elector who has registered by mail qualifies as a removal notice.\n\n(2) A registered elector who removes residence from one place to another within the same county and who has not yet filed a removal notice with the commission shall be permitted to vote once at the elector's former polling place following removal if, at the time of signing the voter's certificate, the elector files with the judge of election a signed removal notice properly filled out. Removal notices under this paragraph shall be returned to the commission with the voting check list, and the commission shall proceed to transfer the registration of the elector under section 1502 (relating to transfer of registration) and shall promptly update information contained in its registration records.

A registered elector may vote in the election district of the elector's former residence not more than one time following the elector's removal. Affirmations made under this paragraph shall be returned to the commission of the elector's former county of residence with the voting checklist, and that commission shall proceed to transfer the registration of the elector under section 1502.
