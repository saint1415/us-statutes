Payment or reimbursement may not be conditioned upon the use of an exclusive or proprietary telemedicine technology or vendor. (b) Applicability.-- (1) Subsection (a) does not apply if the telemedicine-enabling device, technology or service fails to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act or other applicable statute, regulation or guidance. (2) For a health insurance policy for which either rates or forms are required to be filed with the Federal Government or the department, this section shall apply to a policy for which a form or rate is first filed on or after 180 days after the effective date of this paragraph.

Upon issuance of an ignition interlock restricted license to any person, the department shall notify the person that until the person obtains an unrestricted license the person may not drive, operate or be in actual physical control of the movement of any motor vehicle which is not equipped with an ignition interlock system. (c) Issuance of unrestricted license.-- One year from the date of issuance of an ignition interlock restricted license under this section, if otherwise eligible, a person may be issued a replacement license under section 1951(d) that does not contain the ignition interlock system restriction. The department shall not issue an unrestricted license until a person has presented all of the following: (1) Proof that the person has completed the ignition interlock restricted license period under this section.

The department's approval of ignition interlock systems shall be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. Systems approved for use under former 42 Pa.C.S. § 7002(d) (relating to ignition interlock systems for driving under the influence) and any contracts for the installation, maintenance and inspection of the systems in effect as of the effective date of this section shall continue to be approved and in effect until the department again publishes approval of ignition interlock systems in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and enters into new contracts in support of the systems. (h.1) Mobile installation services.-- (1) Approved service providers of department-certified manufacturers of ignition interlock systems shall be permitted to provide mobile installation of ignition interlock systems within this Commonwealth.

Following the completion of the cancellation, disqualification, recall, suspension or revocation which resulted in the recall of the ignition interlock restricted license, the department shall require that the person complete the balance of the ignition interlock restricted license period previously imposed prior to the issuance of a replacement license under section 1951(d) that does not contain an ignition interlock restriction.

(a) General rule.-- (1) A health insurance policy offered, issued or renewed in this Commonwealth shall provide coverage for medically necessary health care services provided through telemedicine and delivered by a participating network provider who provides a covered health care service through telemedicine consistent with the insurer's medical policies. A health insurance policy may not exclude a health care service from coverage solely because the health care service is provided through telemedicine. (2) Subject to paragraph (1), an insurer shall pay or reimburse a participating network provider for covered health care services delivered through telemedicine and pursuant to a health insurance policy in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract as negotiated between the insurer and the participating network provider. A contract that includes payment or reimbursement for covered health care services delivered through telemedicine may not prohibit payment or reimbursement solely because a health care service is provided by telemedicine. Payment or reimbursement may not be conditioned upon the use of an exclusive or proprietary telemedicine technology or vendor. (b) Applicability.-- (1) Subsection (a) does not apply if the telemedicine-enabling device, technology or service fails to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act or other applicable statute, regulation or guidance. (2) For a health insurance policy for which either rates or forms are required to be filed with the Federal Government or the department, this section shall apply to a policy for which a form or rate is first filed on or after 180 days after the effective date of this paragraph. (3) For a health insurance policy for which neither rates nor forms are required to be filed with the Federal Government or the department, this section shall apply to a policy issued or renewed on or after 180 days after the effective date of this paragraph. (c) Construction.-- This section may not be construed to: (1) Prohibit an insurer from paying or reimbursing other health care providers for covered health care services provided through telemedicine. (2) Require an insurer to pay or reimburse an out-of-network health care provider for health care services provided through telemedicine. (3) Require an insurer to pay or reimburse a participating network provider if the provision of the health care service through telemedicine would be inconsistent with the standard of care.",

(a) Restrictions based on condition of highway or bridge.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge only when they determine by conducting an engineering and traffic study as provided for in department regulations that the highway or bridge may be damaged or destroyed unless use by vehicles is prohibited or the permissible size or weight of vehicles is reduced. (2) School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (2.1) Government-owned vehicles, vehicles of local government agency contractors providing material for maintenance and department contractors engaged in or providing material for construction or maintenance shall be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways, except bridges, imposed under this subsection in accordance with department regulations. The following types of documents shall constitute evidence that a vehicle is traveling to or from a site in accordance with this paragraph: (i) A bill of lading. (ii) A shipping order. (iii) A service order or other document that indicates the address of the site and purpose of the trip. (3) The department may issue a statement of policy, which shall take effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, adopting an appropriate methodology to provide letters of local determination that identify particular vehicles, routes or uses as local in nature. (4) The methodology under paragraph (3) may allow for exemptions from 67 Pa. Code Ch. 189 (relating to hauling in excess of posted weight limit) related to the at-risk industry of logging or other forest products experiencing a 20% decline in Statewide employment between March 2002 and March 2011, as determined by the Department of Labor and Industry. (5) The exemptions and related requirements under paragraph (4) may remain in existence only until December 31, 2028. Exemptions for local delivery or pickup may not include traffic going to or coming from a site at which minerals, natural gas or natural resources are developed, harvested or extracted, notwithstanding whether the site is located at a residence, a commercial site or on farmland. Delivery or pickup of logs or other forest products to or from permanent processing mills located on or reachable only through posted highways shall be considered local delivery or pickup. Delivery or pickup of coal to or from permanent coal reprocessing or preparation plants located on or reachable only through posted highways and not on the same posted highway as a site at which coal is extracted shall be considered local delivery or pickup. (b) Restrictions based on traffic conditions.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge whenever they determine that hazardous traffic conditions or other safety factors require such a prohibition or restriction. School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (c) Permits and security.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities may issue permits for movement of vehicles of size and weight in excess of restrictions promulgated under subsections (a) and (b) with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdiction and may require such agreement or security as they deem necessary to cover the cost of repairs and restoration necessitated by the permitted movement of vehicles. In reference to subsection (a), the Commonwealth and local authorities shall not refuse to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction if there is no reasonable alternate route available. For purposes of this section, \"reasonable alternate route\" shall mean a route meeting the criteria set forth in department regulations relating to traffic and engineering studies. (2) The department may establish the types of permits to be issued and agreements to be entered into, subject to the following: (i) Permits may be for long-term or short-term use of the posted highways. (ii) The department may require multiple vehicles traveling to or from a single destination to operate pursuant to a single permit. (iii) The department may establish a permit type allowing the posting authority to determine that damage to the posted highway covered by the permit will be minimal. This type of permit may include categories based on the number and kinds of loads expected, including a category providing that use of the posted highway under a single minimum-use permit of less than 700 loads per year shall not require an agreement or security. The department may alter the 700 loads per year minimum-use threshold if it determines the structural capacity of the State highways can accept a higher or lower amount of over-posted weight traffic. The department may express the threshold as a loads-per-day, loads-per-week or loads-per-month number. (iv) The department may restrict use of de minimis and minimum-use permits during thaw periods as determined by the department. (v) The department shall exclude hauling related to unconventional oil and gas development from minimum-use status based on its disproportionate and qualitatively different impact upon highways and bridges. (3) The department shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. During the two years immediately following the effective date of this section, the department may promulgate temporary regulations, which shall expire no later than three years following the effective date of this paragraph or upon promulgation of final regulations, whichever occurs first. Temporary regulations promulgated by the department under this paragraph shall not be subject to any of the following: (i) Sections 201, 202 and 203 of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law. (ii) The Act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as the Regulatory Review Act. (d) Designation of alternate routes.-- (1) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsections (a) and (b), the Commonwealth may designate alternate routes for vehicles in excess of specified weights or sizes. Such alternate routes may utilize portions of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. (2) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsection (c), when refusing to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an alternate route study. The elements of an engineering and traffic study conducted to designate an alternate route pursuant to this section shall consist of the same elements found in department regulations. (e) Erection of signs.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities shall erect or cause to be erected and maintained restriction signs designating the restrictions within 25 feet of each end of a bridge or portion of highway restricted as provided in subsection (a) or (b). In the case of a restriction on a bridge or on a highway which does not begin or end at an intersection with an unrestricted highway, the Commonwealth or local authorities shall also place an advance informational sign at the intersection nearest each end of the restricted bridge or portion of highway which would allow drivers to avoid the restricted bridge or portion of highway. No person shall be convicted of violating subsection (a) or (b) unless the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the direction the person was driving was posted as required in this subsection. However, failure to post the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the opposite direction or failure to post any advance informational sign shall not constitute a defense to a violation of this section. (f) Actions to be in accordance with department regulations.-- All actions taken under authority of this section shall be taken in accordance with department regulations. (f.1) Local ordinances superseded.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, local authorities are prohibited from enacting or enforcing ordinances inconsistent with the provisions contained in this section. (g) Penalty.-- (1) Any person operating a vehicle or combination upon a highway or bridge in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (a) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $75, except that any person convicted of operating a vehicle with a gross weight in excess of a posted weight shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $150 plus $150 for each 500 pounds, or part thereof, in excess of 3,000 pounds over the maximum allowable weight. (2) Any person operating a vehicle or combination in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (b) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $500. (h) (Reserved). (i) Authority to conduct investigations and audits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an investigation and audit of a person or entity to determine if there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement. Audits shall be limited to proper usage of letters of local determination and de minimis and minimum-use permits. (j) Authority to suspend, revoke or deny permits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may suspend, revoke or deny a permit and agreement if it is determined by the Commonwealth or a local authority that there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

      "text": "§ 6335. Release or holding of hearing. (a) General rule.-- After the petition has been filed alleging the child to be dependent or delinquent, the court shall fix a time for hearing thereon, which, if the child is in detention or shelter care shall not be later than ten days after the filing of the petition. Except as provided in subsection (f), if the hearing is not held within such time, the child shall be immediately released from detention or shelter care. A child may be detained or kept in shelter care for an additional single period not to exceed ten days where: (1) the court determines at a hearing that: (i) evidence material to the case is unavailable; (ii) due diligence to obtain such evidence has been exercised; and (iii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that such evidence will be available at a later date; and (2) the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (i) the life of the child would be in danger; (ii) the community would be exposed to a specific danger; or (iii) the child will abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court. The court shall direct the issuance of a summons to the parents, guardian, or other custodian, a guardian ad litem, and any other persons as appear to the court to be proper or necessary parties to the proceeding, requiring them to appear before the court at the time fixed to answer the allegations of the petition. The summons shall also be directed to the child if he is 14 or more years of age or is alleged to be a delinquent. A copy of the petition shall accompany the summons. (b) Personal appearance.-- The court may endorse upon the summons an order: (1) Directing the parents, guardian, or other custodian of the child to appear personally at the hearing. (2) Directing the person having the physical custody or control of the child to bring the child to the hearing. (c) Warrant of arrest.-- If it appears from affidavit filed or from sworn testimony before the court that the conduct, condition, or surroundings of the child are endangering his health or welfare or those of others, or that he may abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court or will not be brought before the court notwithstanding the service of the summons, the court may issue a warrant of arrest. (d) Form.-- A summons and warrant of arrest shall be in such form and shall be served as prescribed by general rules. (e) Waiver of service.-- A party, other than the child, may waive service of summons by written stipulation or by voluntary appearance at the hearing. If the child is present at the hearing, his counsel, with the consent of the parent, guardian, or other custodian, or guardian ad litem, may waive service of summons in his behalf. (f) Limitations on release.-- The child shall not be released from detention or shelter care under authority of subsection (a) if the failure to hold a hearing within ten days after the filing of the petition is the result of delay caused by the child. Delay caused by the child shall include, but not be limited to: (1) Delay caused by the unavailability of the child or his attorney. (2) Delay caused by any continuance granted at the request of the child or his attorney. (3) Delay caused by the unavailability of a witness resulting from conduct by or on behalf of the child. At the conclusion of any court proceeding in which the scheduled hearing is not held, the court shall state on the record whether the failure to hold the hearing resulted from delay caused by the child. Where the court determines that failure to hold a hearing is the result of delay caused by the child, the child may continue to be held in detention or shelter care. However, the additional period of detention shall not exceed ten days, provided that such detention may be continued by the court for successive ten-day intervals.

(a) Applicability.-- The interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of the following shall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this section: (1) Life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year on or after the operative date of section 410A(e) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (2) Individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1981. (3) Annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1981, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts. (4) The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1981, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts. (b) Calendar year statutory valuation interest rates.-- The following shall apply: (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, I, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearest 0.25%: (i) For life insurance: I = .03 + W(R1 - .03) + W/2(R2 - .09). Where R1 is the lesser of R and .09, R2 is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this section and W is the weighting factor defined in this section. (ii) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: I = .03 + W(R1 - .03). Where R1 is the lesser of R and .09, R2 is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this section and W is the weighting factor defined in this section. (iii) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subparagraph (ii): (A) The formula for life insurance stated in subparagraph (i) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of 10 years. (B) The formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (ii) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of 10 years or less. (iv) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (ii) shall apply. (v) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (ii) shall apply. (2) The following shall apply: (i) If the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for a life insurance policy issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this subparagraph differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than 0.5%, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. (ii) For purposes of applying subparagraph (i), the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980, using the reference interest rate defined in 1979, and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of the operative date of section 410A(e) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (c) Weighting factors.-- The weighting factors referred to in subsection (b) shall be as follows: (1) For life insurance, the guarantee duration shall be the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values, or both, which are guaranteed in the original policy. Weighting factors for life insurance shall be as provided in the following table: Guarantee Duration (Years) Weighting Factors 10 or less .50 More than 10, but not more than 20 .45 More than 20 .35 (2) Weighting factors for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options shall be .80. (3) Weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in paragraph (2), shall be as specified in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii), according to the rules and definitions in subparagraphs (iv), (v) and (vi): (i) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis, the following table shall apply: Guarantee Duration (Years) Weighting Factor for Plan Type A B C 5 or less .80 .60 .50 More than 5, but not more than 10 .75 .60 .50 More than 10, but not more than 20 .65 .50 .45 More than 20 .45 .35 .35 (ii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors shown in subparagraph (i) shall be increased by .15 for plan type A, .25 for plan type B and .05 for plan type C. (iii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis, other than those with no cash settlement options, that do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis that do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than 12 months beyond the valuation date, the factors shown in subparagraph (i) or derived in subparagraph (ii) shall be increased by .05 for plan types A, B and C. (iv) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence. (v) Each plan type referenced in this paragraph shall be defined as follows: (A) \"Plan type A.\" A plan in which at any time the policyholder may withdraw funds only: (I) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; (II) without an adjustment but in installments over five years or more; (III) as an immediate life annuity; or (IV) no withdrawal permitted. (B) \"Plan type B.\" A plan in which, before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, the policyholder may withdraw funds only: (I) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; (II) without an adjustment but in installments over five years or more; or (III) no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without an adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years. (C) \"Plan type C.\" A plan in which the policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either: (I) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; or (II) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund. (vi) The following shall apply: (A) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. (B) Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options shall be valued on an issue year basis. (C) As used in this section: (I) An issue year basis of valuation shall refer to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract. (II) A change in fund basis of valuation shall refer to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund. (d) Reference interest rate.-- The reference interest rate referred to in subsection (b) shall be defined as follows: (1) For life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year preceding the year of issue, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (2) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

(a) Characteristics of valuation.-- For policies or contracts specified in the valuation manual, a company shall establish reserves using a principle-based valuation that: (1) Quantifies benefits and guarantees and the funding associated with contracts and their risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events having a reasonable probability of occurring during the lifetime of the contracts. For policies or contracts with significant tail risk, the valuation must reflect conditions appropriately adverse to quantify the tail risk. (2) Incorporates assumptions, risk analysis methods and financial models and management techniques that are consistent with, but not necessarily identical to, those utilized within the company's overall risk assessment process, while recognizing potential differences in financial reporting structures and any prescribed assumptions or methods. (3) Incorporates assumptions that are: (i) Prescribed in the valuation manual. (ii) If not prescribed in the valuation manual, established by utilizing either of the following: (A) The company's available experience, to the extent it is relevant and statistically credible. (B) Other relevant and statistically credible experience, to the extent that company data is not available, relevant or statistically credible. (4) Provides margins for uncertainty, including adverse deviation and estimation error, so that the greater the uncertainty, the larger the margin and resulting reserve. (b) Company requirements.-- A company using a principle-based valuation for one or more policies or contracts subject to this section as specified in the valuation manual shall: (1) Establish procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial valuation function consistent with those described in the valuation manual. (2) Provide to the commissioner and the board of directors an annual certification of the effectiveness of the internal controls with respect to the principle-based valuation. These controls shall be designed to assure that all material risks inherent in the liabilities and associated assets subject to this valuation are included in the valuation and that valuations are made in accordance with the valuation manual. The certification shall be based on the controls in place as of the end of the preceding calendar year. (3) Develop and file with the commissioner upon request a principle-based valuation report that complies with standards prescribed in the valuation manual. (c) Formulaic reserve component.-- A principle-based valuation may include a prescribed formulaic reserve component. Cross References.

(2) The date of transfer. (3) The transferor's name and current address. (4) The transferee's name and current address. (5) The identity of the vehicle, including its make, year and body type and its complete vehicle identification number. (6) (i) A certification by the transferor that, to the best of his knowledge, the odometer reading reflects the actual miles or kilometers the vehicle has been driven; (ii) if the transferor knows that the odometer reading reflects the amount of mileage in excess of the designed mechanical odometer limit of 99,999 miles or kilometers, he shall include a statement to that effect; or (iii) if the transferor knows that the odometer reading differs from the number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has actually traveled and that the difference is greater than that caused by odometer calibration error, he shall include a statement that the odometer reading is not the actual mileage and should not be relied upon. The transferee shall acknowledge receipt of the disclosure statement by signing it. (b) Prohibitions.-- (1) No transferor shall violate any provision of this section or give a false statement to a transferee in making any disclosure required by this section. (2) No transferee shall accept any disclosure required by any provision of this section if the disclosure is incomplete. (c) Auction sales.-- With regard to any motor vehicle whose ownership is transferred through a motor vehicle auction sales transaction, the motor vehicle auction company conducting the sale shall receive from the transferor a copy of the odometer mileage statement which the transferor is required by subsection (a) to provide to the transferee. (d) Other acceptable disclosure forms.-- Either an odometer mileage statement, approved by the United States Secretary of Transportation pursuant to section 1988 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Public Law 92-513, 15 U.S.C. § 1988), or a Pennsylvania ownership transfer document, approved by the department, which includes the odometer disclosure information as prescribed in subsection (a) shall be deemed to satisfy all the requirements for the content and form of odometer mileage statements. Nothing in this subsection shall exempt a dealer or motor vehicle auction company from the provisions of section 7135 (relating to odometer mileage statement retention). (d.1) Secure power of attorney, licensed dealers.-- The department shall permit a licensed dealer to use a secure power of attorney to transfer a vehicle when the certificate of title is encumbered with a lien, the title has been lost by the transferor and the licensed dealer is applying for a duplicate title or the manufacturer certificate of origin for a new vehicle is in possession of the lienholder. Prior to transferring the vehicle, the dealer shall obtain from the transferor a secure power of attorney authorizing the dealer to transfer to the title all information pertaining to odometers that is required to be disclosed by this title and Federal law, in lieu of the transferor providing such information on the certificate of title. In addition to any other documents required by the department, the dealer shall submit to the department the following: (1) If the transferred vehicle is a retail sale and is to be titled in this Commonwealth, the dealer shall submit the secure power of attorney attached to the application for title, along with the certificate of title and the established fee. (2) If the transferred vehicle is to be titled outside of this Commonwealth, the dealer shall submit to the department the secure copy of the secure power of attorney attached to a copy of the certificate of title and the established fee. (3) If the transferred vehicle is to be transferred to another licensed dealer, the first transferor dealer shall submit to the department the secure copy of the secure power of attorney attached to a copy of the certificate of title and the established fee. Additional transfers between licensed dealers shall be permitted in accordance with section 1113 (relating to transfer to or from manufacturer or dealer).

The power of attorney need not be notarized and may be signed electronically. The insurer is responsible for ensuring the power of attorney complies with the requirements of 15 U.S.C. § 7001 et seq. (relating to electronic signatures in global and national commerce), the requirements of 49 U.S.C. § 32705 (relating to disclosure requirements on transfer of motor vehicles) and any requirements imposed by the Commonwealth. The department may, at its sole discretion, permit the use of a secure power of attorney as described in this subsection for the transfer of other vehicles in addition to salvage vehicles. If the secretary of the United States Department of Transportation promulgates regulations regarding the use of a power of attorney as described in this subsection, those regulations will supersede this subsection in accordance with 49 U.S.C. § 32705(g). (d.3) Certification.-- Nothing in this section shall require the department to certify an electronic signature process or an electronic signature process vendor before accepting a power of attorney that is executed with an electronic signature.

(a) General rule.-- The department shall distribute highway appropriations and executive authorizations for State highway maintenance in the various county maintenance districts in the following manner: (1) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are equal to the combined total base allocations for all the county maintenance districts, each maintenance district shall receive its base allocation. (2) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are less than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, each maintenance district's share shall be reduced, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocation within the funding limits, in the same proportion that each county's base allocations bears to the combined total of all counties' base allocations. (3) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are greater than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, the funds shall be distributed based upon the formula in subsection (b), but notwithstanding the formula calculation for any particular county, no county shall receive less than its base allocation in any year. (b) Formula for distribution.-- The department shall distribute to each county maintenance district: (1) an amount equal to the county's base allocation; plus (2) an amount based on the following incremental formula in which each county shall receive a portion of State highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations in excess of the total of all counties' base allocations, expressed in the following manner: ASHMA (40% RPQc + 15% BMDc + 30% LMc + 15% VMc). (c) Establishment of applicable data.-- The applicable data for all counties corresponding to each individual factor in the incremental formula in subsection (b) shall be established and certified by the Governor by May 1 of each year based on the best information available at that time for the immediately preceding five-year period with the exception of BMD. The submission of data relative to BMD shall only include the immediately preceding 12-month period beginning with fiscal year 1997-1998. In each subsequent fiscal year, an additional year of data relative to BMD shall be added until such time as data from a five-year period has been accumulated. (d) Effect of insufficient funds.-- In the event sufficient funds are not available to fully fund all county maintenance districts under the formula in subsection (b) due to the hold harmless provision in subsection (a), each county maintenance district receiving an increase above its base allocation shall have its share reduced in the proportion that the increase over its base allocation bears to the total increases over the base allocation of all counties entitled to an increase, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocations within the funding limit.

(a) Findings.-- The General Assembly hereby finds that imposition of a tax on oil company revenues should provide the Department of Transportation with an annual growth in revenues which offsets the growth in highway maintenance and construction costs more effectively than the annual changes in revenues produced by the flat-rate tax on the retail price of gasoline and by the various other taxes and fees levied on behalf of the department. As a result of such a tax on oil company revenues, the Department of Transportation should have sufficient revenues to carry out necessary maintenance and construction activities with less frequent increases in highway taxes and fees than the General Assembly has enacted in recent years. One effect of less frequent requests for highway tax and fee increases could be a significant decrease in the ability of the General Assembly to oversee the activities of the Department of Transportation. Accordingly, the General Assembly finds that responsible legislative oversight requires ongoing monitoring of the department's activities and periodic indepth evaluations of its performance. (b) Annual reports.-- No later than 30 days after the effective date of this section, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the 1981-1982 fiscal year. No later than 30 days before the beginning of the 1982-1983 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the upcoming fiscal year. No later than 30 days after the end of the 1981-1982 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the reasons for any major deviations from the maintenance and construction program which had been planned for that member's district during that fiscal year. (c) Performance audits.-- During the 1983-1984 fiscal year, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, a performance audit of the department carried out in accordance with the standards for performance and financial compliance auditing developed by the United States General Accounting Office. The performance audit shall determine whether the department is conducting authorized activities or programs in a manner consistent with accomplishing the objectives intended by the General Assembly and is conducting programs or activities and expending available funds in a faithful, efficient, economical and effective manner. The Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall make a written report of the findings of the performance audit and shall submit a copy of that report to each member of the House of Representatives and each member of the Senate prior to enactment of a maintenance and construction budget for the department for the 1984-1985 fiscal year. During the 1989-1990 fiscal year and every six years thereafter, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, a performance audit of the department similar to the performance audit required by this subsection to be conducted during the 1983-1984 fiscal year.",

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided under subsection (a.1), if a person violates section 3802 (relating to driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance) or has had their operating privileges suspended pursuant to section 1547 (relating to chemical testing to determine amount of alcohol or controlled substance) or 3808(c) (relating to illegally operating a motor vehicle not equipped with ignition interlock) and the person seeks a restoration of operating privileges, the department shall require as a condition of issuing a restricted license pursuant to this section that the following occur: (1) Any motor vehicle to be operated by the individual has been equipped with an ignition interlock system and remains so for the duration of the restricted license period. (2) If there are no motor vehicles owned or to be operated by the person or registered to the person that the person so certify to the department in accordance with the department's regulations. (a.1) Exception.-- Subsection (a) shall not apply to an individual who meets all of the following: (1) Is subject to the penalties under section 3804(a)(1) (relating to penalties) or subject to mandatory suspension of operating privilege under section 3807(d) (relating to Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition).

(b) Application for a restricted license.-- A person subject to this section shall apply to the department for an ignition interlock restricted license under section 1951 (relating to driver's license and learner's permit), which shall be clearly marked to restrict the person to only driving, operating or being in actual physical control of the movement of motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock system. Upon issuance of an ignition interlock restricted license to any person, the department shall notify the person that until the person obtains an unrestricted license the person may not drive, operate or be in actual physical control of the movement of any motor vehicle which is not equipped with an ignition interlock system. (c) Issuance of unrestricted license.-- One year from the date of issuance of an ignition interlock restricted license under this section, if otherwise eligible, a person may be issued a replacement license under section 1951(d) that does not contain the ignition interlock system restriction. The department shall not issue an unrestricted license until a person has presented all of the following: (1) Proof that the person has completed the ignition interlock restricted license period under this section. (2) Certification by the vendor that provided the ignition interlock device that the person has complied with subsection (h.2). (d) Prohibition.-- Except as set forth in subsections (e) and (f), until the person obtains an unrestricted license, the person may not own, register, drive, operate or be in actual physical control of the movement of any motor vehicle within this Commonwealth unless the motor vehicle is equipped with an ignition interlock system. (e) Economic hardship exemption.-- A person subject to the requirements of subsection (a) may apply to the department for a hardship exemption to the requirement that an ignition interlock system must be installed in each of the person's motor vehicles. Where the department determines that the applicant establishes that such a requirement would result in undue financial hardship, the department may permit the applicant to install an ignition interlock system on only one of the applicant's motor vehicles. However, the applicant in accordance with section 3808 (relating to illegally operating a motor vehicle not equipped with ignition interlock) shall be prohibited from driving, operating or being in actual physical control of the movement of any motor vehicle, including any of the applicant's motor vehicles, which is not equipped with an ignition interlock system.

Proof of the notification may be established only by the notarized signature of the employer acknowledging notification on a form which shall be provided by the department for this purpose and shall include a contact telephone number of the employer. (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply in any of the following circumstances: (i) To the extent that an employer-owned motor vehicle is made available to the employee for personal use.

The department's approval of ignition interlock systems shall be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. Systems approved for use under former 42 Pa.C.S. § 7002(d) (relating to ignition interlock systems for driving under the influence) and any contracts for the installation, maintenance and inspection of the systems in effect as of the effective date of this section shall continue to be approved and in effect until the department again publishes approval of ignition interlock systems in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and enters into new contracts in support of the systems. (h.1) Mobile installation services.-- (1) Approved service providers of department-certified manufacturers of ignition interlock systems shall be permitted to provide mobile installation of ignition interlock systems within this Commonwealth. (2) Mobile installation of ignition interlock systems shall be held to the same security and procedural standards as provided in specifications of the department. (3) Approved service providers of mobile installation of ignition interlock systems shall not permit the program participant or any unauthorized personnel to witness the installation of the ignition interlock system. (4) Regular maintenance of ignition interlocks after mobile installation shall be performed according to the specifications established by the department. (h.2) Declaration of compliance.-- Restrictions imposed under section 1556 (relating to ignition interlock limited license) shall remain in effect until the department receives a declaration from the person's ignition interlock device vendor, in a form provided or approved by the department, certifying that the following incidents have not occurred in the two consecutive months prior to the date entered on the certificate, and for the purposes of a suspension imposed under section 3807(d)(2), the person's ignition interlock device vendor shall certify the following incidents have not occurred in the prior 30 days entered on the certificate: (1) An attempt to start the vehicle with a breath alcohol concentration of 0.08% or more, not followed within 10 minutes by a subsequent attempt with a breath alcohol concentration lower than 0.08%. (2) Failure to take or pass any required retest. (3) Failure of the person to appear at the ignition interlock system vendor when required for maintenance, repair, calibration, monitoring, inspection or replacement of the device such that the ignition interlock system no longer functions as required under subsection (h). (i) Offenses committed during a period for which an ignition interlock restricted license has been issued.-- Except as provided in sections 1547(b.1) and 3808(c) (relating to illegally operating a motor vehicle not equipped with ignition interlock), any driver who has been issued an ignition interlock restricted license and as to whom the department receives a certified record of a conviction of an offense for which the penalty is a cancellation, disqualification, recall, suspension or revocation of operating privileges shall have the ignition interlock restricted license recalled, and the driver shall surrender the ignition interlock restricted license to the department. Following the completion of the cancellation, disqualification, recall, suspension or revocation which resulted in the recall of the ignition interlock restricted license, the department shall require that the person complete the balance of the ignition interlock restricted license period previously imposed prior to the issuance of a replacement license under section 1951(d) that does not contain an ignition interlock restriction.

For policies or contracts with significant tail risk, the valuation must reflect conditions appropriately adverse to quantify the tail risk. (2) Incorporates assumptions, risk analysis methods and financial models and management techniques that are consistent with, but not necessarily identical to, those utilized within the company's overall risk assessment process, while recognizing potential differences in financial reporting structures and any prescribed assumptions or methods. (3) Incorporates assumptions that are: (i) Prescribed in the valuation manual. (ii) If not prescribed in the valuation manual, established by utilizing either of the following: (A) The company's available experience, to the extent it is relevant and statistically credible. (B) Other relevant and statistically credible experience, to the extent that company data is not available, relevant or statistically credible. (4) Provides margins for uncertainty, including adverse deviation and estimation error, so that the greater the uncertainty, the larger the margin and resulting reserve. (b) Company requirements.-- A company using a principle-based valuation for one or more policies or contracts subject to this section as specified in the valuation manual shall: (1) Establish procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial valuation function consistent with those described in the valuation manual. (2) Provide to the commissioner and the board of directors an annual certification of the effectiveness of the internal controls with respect to the principle-based valuation. These controls shall be designed to assure that all material risks inherent in the liabilities and associated assets subject to this valuation are included in the valuation and that valuations are made in accordance with the valuation manual. The certification shall be based on the controls in place as of the end of the preceding calendar year.

(2) The date of transfer. (3) The transferor's name and current address. (4) The transferee's name and current address. (5) The identity of the vehicle, including its make, year and body type and its complete vehicle identification number. (6) (i) A certification by the transferor that, to the best of his knowledge, the odometer reading reflects the actual miles or kilometers the vehicle has been driven; (ii) if the transferor knows that the odometer reading reflects the amount of mileage in excess of the designed mechanical odometer limit of 99,999 miles or kilometers, he shall include a statement to that effect; or (iii) if the transferor knows that the odometer reading differs from the number of miles or kilometers the vehicle has actually traveled and that the difference is greater than that caused by odometer calibration error, he shall include a statement that the odometer reading is not the actual mileage and should not be relied upon. The transferee shall acknowledge receipt of the disclosure statement by signing it. (b) Prohibitions.-- (1) No transferor shall violate any provision of this section or give a false statement to a transferee in making any disclosure required by this section. (2) No transferee shall accept any disclosure required by any provision of this section if the disclosure is incomplete. (c) Auction sales.-- With regard to any motor vehicle whose ownership is transferred through a motor vehicle auction sales transaction, the motor vehicle auction company conducting the sale shall receive from the transferor a copy of the odometer mileage statement which the transferor is required by subsection (a) to provide to the transferee. (d) Other acceptable disclosure forms.-- Either an odometer mileage statement, approved by the United States Secretary of Transportation pursuant to section 1988 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Public Law 92-513, 15 U.S.C. § 1988), or a Pennsylvania ownership transfer document, approved by the department, which includes the odometer disclosure information as prescribed in subsection (a) shall be deemed to satisfy all the requirements for the content and form of odometer mileage statements. Nothing in this subsection shall exempt a dealer or motor vehicle auction company from the provisions of section 7135 (relating to odometer mileage statement retention). (d.1) Secure power of attorney, licensed dealers.-- The department shall permit a licensed dealer to use a secure power of attorney to transfer a vehicle when the certificate of title is encumbered with a lien, the title has been lost by the transferor and the licensed dealer is applying for a duplicate title or the manufacturer certificate of origin for a new vehicle is in possession of the lienholder. Prior to transferring the vehicle, the dealer shall obtain from the transferor a secure power of attorney authorizing the dealer to transfer to the title all information pertaining to odometers that is required to be disclosed by this title and Federal law, in lieu of the transferor providing such information on the certificate of title. In addition to any other documents required by the department, the dealer shall submit to the department the following: (1) If the transferred vehicle is a retail sale and is to be titled in this Commonwealth, the dealer shall submit the secure power of attorney attached to the application for title, along with the certificate of title and the established fee. (2) If the transferred vehicle is to be titled outside of this Commonwealth, the dealer shall submit to the department the secure copy of the secure power of attorney attached to a copy of the certificate of title and the established fee. (3) If the transferred vehicle is to be transferred to another licensed dealer, the first transferor dealer shall submit to the department the secure copy of the secure power of attorney attached to a copy of the certificate of title and the established fee. Additional transfers between licensed dealers shall be permitted in accordance with section 1113 (relating to transfer to or from manufacturer or dealer). No more than one secure power of attorney shall be utilized with the certificate of title during this authorized transfer process. Upon application for certificate of title, the secure power of attorney utilized to verify odometer information when the vehicle was encumbered with a lien shall be submitted with the certificate of title. (d.2) Secure power of attorney, insurance companies.-- The department shall permit an insurer as defined in section 1702 (relating to definitions) to use a secure power of attorney to transfer a salvage vehicle when the certificate of title is encumbered with a lien, when the title has been lost by the transferor and the insurer is applying for a duplicate title or when the manufacturer certificate of origin for a new vehicle is in possession of the lienholder. The power of attorney need not be notarized and may be signed electronically. The insurer is responsible for ensuring the power of attorney complies with the requirements of 15 U.S.C. § 7001 et seq. (relating to electronic signatures in global and national commerce), the requirements of 49 U.S.C. § 32705 (relating to disclosure requirements on transfer of motor vehicles) and any requirements imposed by the Commonwealth. The department may, at its sole discretion, permit the use of a secure power of attorney as described in this subsection for the transfer of other vehicles in addition to salvage vehicles. If the secretary of the United States Department of Transportation promulgates regulations regarding the use of a power of attorney as described in this subsection, those regulations will supersede this subsection in accordance with 49 U.S.C. § 32705(g). (d.3) Certification.-- Nothing in this section shall require the department to certify an electronic signature process or an electronic signature process vendor before accepting a power of attorney that is executed with an electronic signature. (d.4) Electronic secure power of attorney.-- The department may, at its sole discretion, permit the use of a secure power of attorney signed electronically as described in subsection (d.2) for the transfer of vehicles by licensed dealers.

(a) Certification.-- After the establishment, implementation and administration of the Constables' Education and Training Program created under sections 7144 (relating to program established) and 7145 (relating to program contents), no constable or deputy constable shall perform any judicial duties nor demand or receive any fee, surcharge or mileage provided by this subchapter unless he has been certified under this subchapter. (b) Liability insurance.-- Every constable and deputy constable must file with the clerk of courts proof that he has, currently in force, a policy of professional liability insurance covering each individual in the performance of his judicial duties with a minimum coverage of $250,000 per incident and a minimum aggregate of $500,000 per year. The Constables' Education and Training Board shall immediately investigate and implement the most cost-effective method of achieving liability insurance for constables and deputy constables under this subsection. (c) Loss of certification.-- Any constable or deputy constable who fails, neglects or refuses to maintain a current insurance policy as required by subsection (b) or to file proof thereof with the clerk of courts shall cease automatically to be certified to perform judicial duties upon the expiration of the policy of which proof has been filed with the clerk of courts. (d) Recertification.-- Any constable or deputy constable who ceases to be certified to perform judicial duties as a result of the operation of subsection (c) may later be recertified immediately by filing with the clerk of courts proof that such insurance has been in force continuously since the officer was last certified to perform judicial duties. In the case of a violation of subsection (c), the individual may be recertified by complying with subsection (b). (e) Limitations on liability.-- The provisions of this subchapter shall not be deemed to impose respondeat superior liability on any county. (f) Conduct.-- While a constable or deputy constable is performing duties other than judicial duties, regardless of whether or not he is certified under this subchapter, he shall not in any manner hold himself out to be active as an agent, employee or representative of any court, magisterial district judge or judge.
