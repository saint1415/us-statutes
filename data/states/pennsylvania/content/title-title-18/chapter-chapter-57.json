Every order entered under this section shall require that such interception begin and terminate as soon as practicable and be conducted in such a manner as to minimize or eliminate the interception of such communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter by making reasonable efforts, whenever possible, to reduce the hours of interception authorized by said order. In the event the intercepted communication is in a code or foreign language and an expert in that code or foreign language is not reasonably available during the interception period, minimization may be accomplished as soon as practicable after such interception. No order entered under this section shall authorize the interception of wire, electronic or oral communications for any period exceeding 30 days. The 30-day period begins on the day on which the investigative or law enforcement officers or agency first begins to conduct an interception under the order, or ten days after the order is entered, whichever is earlier. Extensions or renewals of such an order may be granted for additional periods of not more than 30 days each. No extension or renewal shall be granted unless an application for it is made in accordance with this section, and the judge makes the findings required by section 5710 (relating to grounds for entry of order).\n\n(c) Responsibility.--The order shall require the Attorney General or the district attorney, or their designees, to be responsible for the supervision of the interception.\n\n(d) Progress reports.--Whenever an order authorizing an interception is entered, the order may require reports to be made to the judge who issued the order showing what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception. The reports shall be made at such intervals as the judge may require.\n\n(e) Final report.--Whenever an interception is authorized pursuant to this section, a complete written list of names of participants and evidence of offenses discovered, including those not stated in the application for order, shall be filed with the court as soon as practicable after the authorized interception is terminated.\n\n(f) Assistance.--An order authorizing the interception of a wire, electronic or oral communication shall, upon request of the applicant, direct that a provider of communication service shall furnish the applicant forthwith all information, facilities and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the interception unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the services that such service provider is affording the person whose communications are to be intercepted. The obligation of a provider of communication service under such an order may include, but is not limited to, installation of a pen register or of a trap and trace device, providing caller ID, deluxe caller ID or any other features available to ascertain the telephone number, location or subscriber information of a facility contacting the facility whose communications are to be intercepted, disclosure of a record or other information otherwise available under section 5743 (relating to requirements for governmental access), including conducting an in-progress trace during an interception, provided that such obligation of a provider of communications service is technologically feasible. The order shall apply regardless of whether the electronic service provider is headquartered within this Commonwealth, if the interception is otherwise conducted within this Commonwealth as provided under this chapter. The order regarding disclosure of a record or other information otherwise available under section 5743 shall apply to all electronic service providers who service facilities which contact or are contacted by the facility whose communications are to be intercepted, regardless of whether the order specifically names any provider of communication service.

Once such disclosure has been made, then any person may disclose the contents or evidence in any such proceeding.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), no disclosure in any such proceeding shall be made so long as any order excluding such contents or evidence pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) is in effect.\n\n(b) Motion to exclude.--Any aggrieved person who is a party to any proceeding in any court, board or agency of this Commonwealth may move to exclude the contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, on any of the following grounds:\n\n(1) Unless intercepted pursuant to an exception set forth in section 5704 (relating to exceptions to prohibition of interception and disclosure of communications), the interception was made without prior procurement of an order of authorization under section 5712 (relating to issuance of order and effect) or an order of approval under section 5713(a) (relating to emergency situations) or 5713.1(b) (relating to emergency hostage and barricade situations).\n\n(2) The order of authorization issued under section 5712 or the order of approval issued under section 5713(a) or 5713.1(b) was not supported by probable cause with respect to the matters set forth in section 5710(a)(1) and (2) (relating to grounds for entry of order).\n\n(3) The order of authorization issued under section 5712 is materially insufficient on its face.\n\n(4) The interception materially deviated from the requirements of the order of authorization.\n\n(5) With respect to interceptions pursuant to section 5704(2), the consent to the interception was coerced by the Commonwealth.\n\n(6) Where required pursuant to section 5704(2)(iv), the interception was made without prior procurement of a court order or without probable cause.\n\n(c) Procedure.--\n\n(1) The motion shall be made in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure governing such proceedings. The court, board or agency, upon the filing of such motion, shall make available to the movant or his counsel the intercepted communication and evidence derived therefrom.\n\n(2) In considering a motion to exclude under subsection (b)(2), both the written application under section 5710(a) and all matters that were presented to the judge under section 5710(b) shall be admissible.\n\n(3) The movant shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the grounds for exclusion asserted under subsection (b)(3) and (4).\n\n(4) With respect to exclusion claims under subsection (b)(1), (2) and (5), the respondent shall bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n(5) With respect to exclusion claims under subsection (b)(6), the movant shall have the initial burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the interception took place in his home. Once he meets this burden, the burden shall shift to the respondent to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the interception was in accordance with section 5704(2)(iv).\n\n(6) Evidence shall not be deemed to have been derived from communications excludable under subsection (b) if the respondent can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the Commonwealth or the respondent had a basis independent of the excluded communication for discovering such evidence or that such evidence would have been inevitably discovered by the Commonwealth or the respondent absent the excluded communication.\n\n(d) Appeal.--In addition to any other right of appeal, the Commonwealth shall have the right to appeal from an order granting a motion to exclude if the official to whom the order authorizing the intercept was granted shall certify to the court that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay. The appeal shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of Title 42 (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure).\n\n(e) Exclusiveness of remedies and sanctions.--The remedies and sanctions described in this subchapter with respect to the interception of wire, electronic or oral communications are the only judicial remedies and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this subchapter involving such communications.\n\n(Feb. 18, 1998, P.L.102, No.19, eff. imd.)\n\n1998 Amendment.Act 19 added section 5721.1.\n\nCross References.Section 5721.1 is referred to in section 5749 of this title.",

Without notifying the subscriber or customer of the subpoena or court order, the service provider shall create the backup copy as soon as practicable, consistent with its regular business practices, and shall confirm to the investigative or law enforcement officer that the backup copy has been made. The backup copy shall be created within two business days after receipt by the service provider of the subpoena or court order.\n\n(2) Notice to the subscriber or customer shall be made by the investigative or law enforcement officer within three days after receipt of confirmation that the backup copy has been made, unless the notice is delayed pursuant to section 5745(a) (relating to delayed notice).\n\n(3) The service provider shall not destroy or permit the destruction of the backup copy until the later of:\n\n(i) the delivery of the information; or\n\n(ii) the resolution of all proceedings, including appeals of any proceeding, concerning the government's subpoena or court order.\n\n(4) The service provider shall release the backup copy to the requesting investigative or law enforcement officer no sooner than 14 days after the officer's notice to the subscriber or customer if the service provider has not:\n\n(i) received notice from the subscriber or customer that the subscriber or customer has challenged the officer's request; and\n\n(ii) initiated proceedings to challenge the request of the officer.\n\n(5) An investigative or law enforcement officer may seek to require the creation of a backup copy under paragraph (1) if in his sole discretion the officer determines that there is reason to believe that notification under section 5743 of the existence of the subpoena or court order may result in destruction of or tampering with evidence. This determination is not subject to challenge by the subscriber, customer or service provider.\n\n(b) Customer challenges.--\n\n(1) Within 14 days after notice by the investigative or law enforcement officer to the subscriber or customer under subsection (a)(2), the subscriber or customer may file a motion to quash the subpoena or vacate the court order, copies to be served upon the officer and written notice of the challenge to be given to the service provider. A motion to vacate a court order shall be filed in the court which issued the order. A motion to quash a subpoena shall be filed in the court which has authority to enforce the subpoena.

If the court is unable to determine the motion or application on the basis of the parties' initial allegations and responses, the court may conduct such additional proceedings as it deems appropriate. All such proceedings shall be completed and the motion or application decided as soon as practicable after the filing of the officer's response.\n\n(4) If the court finds that the applicant is not the subscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the investigative or law enforcement officer are maintained, or that there is reason to believe that the investigative or law enforcement inquiry is legitimate and that the communications sought are relevant to that inquiry, it shall deny the motion or application and order the process enforced. If the court finds that the applicant is the subscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental entity are maintained, and that there is not reason to believe that the communications sought are relevant to a legitimate investigative or law enforcement inquiry, or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, it shall order the process quashed.\n\n(5) A court order denying a motion or application under this section shall not be deemed a final order, and no interlocutory appeal may be taken therefrom. The Commonwealth or investigative or law enforcement officer shall have the right to appeal from an order granting a motion or application under this section.\n\n(Feb. 18, 1998, P.L.102, No.19, eff. imd.)\n\n1998 Amendment.Act 19 amended subsec.
