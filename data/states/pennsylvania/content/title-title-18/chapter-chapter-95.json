If a district attorney receives information that any person described in subsection (b) may have committed an offense which is classified higher than a summary offense in a county other than the district attorney's county, the district attorney shall refer the information to the district attorney of that county.\n\n(a.1) Special investigative counsel.--The panel, upon the petition of the requesting judge, shall appoint a special investigative counsel to conduct a preliminary investigation in accordance with this chapter whenever the panel receives information from a requesting judge sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate criminal contempt of court as described in subsection (d).\n\n(b) Applicability.--The persons referred to in subsection (a) shall be as follows:\n\n(1) The Attorney General.\n\n(1.1) A deputy Attorney General or an individual working in the Office of Attorney General who is defined as a \"public employee\" under 65 Pa.C.S. § 1102 (relating to definitions) acting in concert with the Attorney General to commit an offense which is classified higher than a summary offense.\n\n(2) Any individual who leaves any office or position described in paragraph (1) or (1.1) during the incumbency of the Attorney General with or under whom the individual served in the office or position, plus one year after the incumbency, but not longer than a period of three years after the individual leaves the office or position. This paragraph shall only apply to an individual described in paragraph (1.1) who may have acted in concert with an individual described in paragraph (1) to commit an offense which is classified higher than a summary offense.\n\n(3) Any individual who held an office or position described in paragraph (1) or (1.1) during the incumbency of one Attorney General and who continued to hold the office or position for not more than 90 days into the term of the next Attorney General, during the one-year period after the individual leaves the office or position.

A district attorney shall determine whether grounds to investigate exist no later than 90 days after the information is first received. If within that 90-day period a district attorney determines that the information is not specific or is not from a credible source, then a district attorney shall close the matter.

If a special investigative counsel is appointed, the special investigative counsel may only accept the appointment when the appointment would not conflict with the rules governing professional conduct.\n\n(d) Requesting judge's application.--A requesting judge, on his own or at the request of another judge, may apply to the panel for appointment of a special investigative counsel upon a certification that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:\n\n(1) there has been a criminal contempt of court;\n\n(2) investigation by a prosecutor may be necessary to address a breach in the sanctity of court proceedings; and\n\n(3) the prosecutor with statutory authority to conduct the investigation has or is likely to have a conflict of interest.\n\n(e) Compensation.--A special investigative counsel appointed under this chapter shall receive compensation at the per diem rate equal to the annual rate of basic pay payable to the Attorney General.
