(2) In the absence of a written agreement or law to the contrary, the performer or performers of a live performance are presumed to own the rights to record those sounds. (3) For purposes of this section, a person who is authorized to maintain custody and control over business records that reflect whether or not the owner of the live performance consented to having the live performance recorded is a competent witness in a proceeding regarding the issue of consent.

Notwithstanding any limitation in section 1106 (relating to restitution for injuries to person or property), the order of restitution may be based on the aggregate wholesale value of lawfully manufactured and authorized recorded devices corresponding to the non-conforming recorded devices involved in the offense. All other provisions of section 1106 not inconsistent with this provision shall apply to an order of restitution under this section.

(a) Vehicles generally.-- (1) A vehicle may not be operated as a taxicab with citywide call or demand rights in cities of the first class unless a certificate of public convenience is issued by the authority authorizing the operation of the taxicab and a medallion is attached to the hood of the vehicle. Prior to the issuance of a medallion, the certificate holder shall have its vehicle inspected by the authority. (2) The authority shall require, by order or regulation, that each vehicle within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter submit to periodic inspections by authority personnel to ensure that the vehicle meets the requirements of this subchapter and authority regulations. (3) Authority inspection requirements for vehicles within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to the vehicle requirements set forth in Title 75 (relating to vehicles) and may include vehicle age and mileage limitations. Authority inspection and recording requirements shall be established by regulations. (4) No vehicle which is more than eight years old shall continue in operation as a taxicab. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority may authorize the operation of antique vehicles in call or demand service in such circumstances as the authority may deem appropriate. (5) Each taxicab certificate holder's tariff rates shall be clearly and visibly displayed in each taxicab. (6) A medallion shall not be removed from a vehicle without prior notification to and permission of the authority. (7) A medallion authorizes operation of a vehicle as a taxicab only for the fiscal year for which the medallion is issued. (b) Driver security devices.-- Each vehicle authorized to provide taxicab service shall be equipped with such security devices as the authority may, in its discretion, require by order or regulation. (c) Service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon call or demand and parcels, packages and property at the same basic metered rates charged to passengers: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its centralized dispatch system; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as a continuous part of a trip. (d) Other vehicles.-- (1) A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission authorizing call or demand service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and property: (i) to cities of the first class in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (ii) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond that city of the first class if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its radio dispatch service. (2) Carriers authorized by the authority to provide taxicab service to designated areas within cities of the first class on a non-citywide basis pursuant to section 5711(c)(2.1) (relating to power of authority to issue certificates of public convenience) shall retain their authorization in those areas of a city of the first class subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the authority and orders and regulations of the authority issued under this chapter. The authority shall not grant additional rights to new or existing carriers to serve designated areas within cities of the first class on a non-citywide basis. (e) Penalties involving certificated taxicabs.-- Operating a certificated taxicab in violation of subsections (a) and (b) or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders of subsections (a) and (b) may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725 (relating to civil penalties). (f) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a taxicab, or giving the appearance of offering call or demand service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience and a medallion is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each offense thereafter. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as or appearing as a taxicab without a certificate of public convenience and a medallion are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (g) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) The authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles, medallions and equipment which are utilized to provide call or demand service in cities of the first class without a proper certificate of public convenience issued by the authority or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and payment of the costs of the authority associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle, medallion and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction. (ii) To all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner and operator of the confiscated property. (iii) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the lien of any registered lienholder of the confiscated property upon demand. (iv) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the registered owner of the confiscated property upon demand. (v) When not claimed by any registered lienholder or registered owner within one year of the auction date, remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the fund. (g.1) Assessment.-- After application of the proceeds from the sale of confiscated property under subsection (f), the uncompensated costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction and all outstanding penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property may be assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property as the authority may prescribe by regulation. (h) Counterfeit medallions.-- The manufacture or possession of a counterfeit medallion is a misdemeanor of the third degree for each offense.

(b) Legislative findings.-- It is hereby determined by the General Assembly to reaffirm the legislative findings contained in the act of November 28, 1986 (P.L.1465, No.146), known as the Reciprocal Limitations Act, and codified in this section: (1) The award of contracts to the lowest responsible bidder generally provides for the most economical procurement of supplies and construction. (2) In some cases, award to the lowest responsible bidder may not be the most economical and practicable when the best interests of the Commonwealth are concerned. (3) Some states apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or they apply a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders. (4) The application of this preference or prohibition by other states diminishes or eliminates opportunities for bidders and manufacturers who reside in this Commonwealth to obtain construction contracts from or to sell supplies to states that have this preference, thereby resulting in the loss of business for resident bidders and manufacturers. Therefore, in order to offset or counteract the discriminatory practices of other states, discourage other states from applying a preference and ultimately to aid employment, help business and industry located in this Commonwealth, attract new business and industry to this Commonwealth and provide additional tax revenue both from those receiving contracts and those employed by contractors, the General Assembly hereby declares that it is the policy of this Commonwealth to respond in like manner against those states that apply preferences or prohibitions by giving a similar offsetting preference to residents in this Commonwealth and bidders offering supplies manufactured in this Commonwealth and by prohibiting the purchase or use of certain supplies, in accordance with the provisions of this section. (c) Preference for supplies.-- In all procurements of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 (relating to small procurements), all Commonwealth agencies shall give preference to those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in this Commonwealth as against those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that gives or requires a preference to supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the other state for that particular supply. (d) Preference for resident bidders or offerors.-- When a contract for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 is to be awarded, a resident bidder or offeror shall be granted a preference as against a nonresident bidder or offeror from any state that gives or requires a preference to bidders or offerors from that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the state of the nonresident bidder or offeror. (e) Prohibition.-- For all contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, no Commonwealth agency shall specify for, use or procure any supplies which are produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that prohibits the specification for, use or procurement of these supplies in or on its public buildings or other works when these supplies are not produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. (f) Listing discriminating states.-- The department shall prepare a list of the states which apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or offerors or a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders or offerors and shall publish the list in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. When a state applies a new preference or prohibition, the department shall publish that information in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as an addition to the original list. (g) Inclusion in invitation for bids or request for proposals.-- In all invitations for bids and requests for proposals for the procurement of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, all Commonwealth agencies shall include a list of all the states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference favoring in-state supplies, bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 shall include a list of all states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference for in-state bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the purchasing agency for small procurements under section 514 shall also include a list of all states that apply a prohibition against certain supplies and shall inform potential bidders or offerors that they are prohibited from using supplies from those states. If a bid or proposal discloses that the bidder or offeror is offering supplies from a state which prohibits the use of out-of-state supplies, the bid or proposal shall be rejected. (h) Federal funds.-- The provisions of this section shall not be applicable when the application of this section may jeopardize the receipt of Federal funds. (i) Waiver.-- The provisions of this section may be waived when the head of the purchasing agency determines in writing that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth. (j) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Resident bidder or offeror.\" A person, partnership, corporation or other business entity authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth and having a bona fide establishment for transacting business in this Commonwealth at which it was transacting business on the date when bids or proposals for the public contract were first solicited.

      "text": "§ 2808. Competitive transition charge. (a) General rule.-- To provide each electric utility with an opportunity to recover its transition or stranded costs following the commission's determination under subsection (c), every customer accessing the transmission or distribution network shall pay a competitive transition charge to the electric distribution company in whose certificated territory that customer is located. The costs to be recovered shall be allocated to customer classes in a manner that does not shift interclass or intraclass costs and maintains consistency with the allocation methodology for utility production plant accepted by the commission in the electric utility's most recent base rate proceeding. If a customer installs on-site generation which operates in parallel with other generation on the public utility's system and which significantly reduces the customer's purchases of electricity through the transmission and distribution network, the customer's fully allocated share of transition or stranded costs shall be recovered from the customer through a competitive transition charge. The recovery of transition or stranded costs associated with existing generating facilities is contingent on continued operation at reasonable availability levels of the generation facilities for which recovery has been approved, except when the generation facility is uneconomic on a production cost basis because of the transition to a competitive market. (b) Period for collecting competitive transition charge.-- The competitive transition charge shall be included on bills to customers for a period not to exceed nine years from the effective date of this chapter unless an alternative payment methodology is mutually agreed upon by the customer and the utility or unless the commission in its discretion and for good cause shown orders an alternative payment period. In establishing the length of the period for collection of the competitive transition charge, the commission shall consider the effect on the ability of the Commonwealth to compete in attracting industry and jobs, on the financial health of electric utilities and other relevant factors. (c) Determination of competitive transition charge.-- In determining the level of transition or stranded costs that an electric utility may recover through the competitive transition charge, the commission shall apply the following principles: (1) The commission shall allow recovery of regulatory assets and other deferred charges typically recoverable under current regulatory practice, the unfunded portion of the utility's projected nuclear generating plant decommissioning costs and cost obligations under contracts with nonutility generating projects that have received a commission order. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring an electric utility or a nonutility generating project to enter into an arrangement to buy down, buy out and terminate or otherwise restructure a contract or as authorizing the commission to require a utility to pursue such an arrangement with a nonutility generating project. (2) The commission shall allow recovery of an electric utility's prudently incurred costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation of nonutility generating projects consistent with section 527 (relating to cogeneration rules and regulations). (3) The commission shall determine the level of other generation-related transition or stranded costs that may be recovered through the competitive transition charge. (4) The commission shall consider the extent to which the electric utility has undertaken efforts to mitigate generation-related transition or stranded costs by appropriate means in a manner that is reasonable under all of the circumstances, including consideration of whether mitigation has been commensurate with the magnitude of the electric utility's generation-related transition or stranded costs. During the transition period, electric utilities shall have the duty to mitigate generation-related transition or stranded costs to the extent practicable. Efforts may include the following: (i) Acceleration of depreciation and amortization of existing rate base generation assets. (ii) Minimization of new capital spending for existing rate base generation assets. (iii) Reallocation of depreciation reserves to existing rate base generation assets. (iv) Reduction of book assets by application of new proceeds of any sale of idle or underutilized existing rate base generation assets. (v) Maximization of market revenues from existing rate base generation assets. (vi) Issuance of securitized debt pursuant to the provisions of section 2812 (relating to approval of transition bonds). (5) Of equal importance to the mitigation efforts under paragraph (4), the commission shall consider efforts undertaken over time, prior to the enactment of this chapter, to reduce or moderate customer rate levels while maintaining safe and efficient operations. (d) Commission review.-- As a component of its restructuring plan, each electric utility shall file with the commission a recovery plan, including a proposed competitive transition charge and supporting documentation. In evaluating a recovery plan and any proposed competitive transition charge, the commission shall schedule open evidentiary hearings with proper notice and opportunity for all parties to cross-examine witnesses as necessary. (e) Use of transition bonds.-- After the effective date of this chapter, a utility may apply to the commission for a qualified rate order under section 2812 for some or all of its transition or stranded costs. (1) In evaluating a utility application under this subsection, the commission shall schedule hearings, as necessary. (2) If the commission issues a qualified rate order under section 2812 and if the transition bonds approved by that order are successfully issued, then: (i) the utility shall impose and collect through its customer bills the intangible transition charges approved by that qualified rate order; and (ii) simultaneously, either the utility's rates for electric service or the utility's competitive transition charges shall be reduced by an amount equal to the revenue requirement of the transition or stranded costs for which transition bonds have been successfully issued. (f) Annual revenue.-- Consistent with section 1307(e) (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments), the commission shall establish procedures for the annual review of the competitive transition charge. The review shall reconcile the annual revenues received from the charge with the annual amortization of transition or stranded costs approved by the commission under this section. The commission shall adjust the competitive transition charge based upon underrecovery or overrecovery of the annual amortization amount. Cross References. Section 2808 is referred to in sections 2802, 2803, 2804, 2812 of this title.",

      "text": "§ 107. Reciprocal limitations. (a) Short title of section.-- This section shall be known and may be cited as the Reciprocal Limitations Act. (b) Legislative findings.-- It is hereby determined by the General Assembly to reaffirm the legislative findings contained in the act of November 28, 1986 (P.L.1465, No.146), known as the Reciprocal Limitations Act, and codified in this section: (1) The award of contracts to the lowest responsible bidder generally provides for the most economical procurement of supplies and construction. (2) In some cases, award to the lowest responsible bidder may not be the most economical and practicable when the best interests of the Commonwealth are concerned. (3) Some states apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or they apply a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders. (4) The application of this preference or prohibition by other states diminishes or eliminates opportunities for bidders and manufacturers who reside in this Commonwealth to obtain construction contracts from or to sell supplies to states that have this preference, thereby resulting in the loss of business for resident bidders and manufacturers. Therefore, in order to offset or counteract the discriminatory practices of other states, discourage other states from applying a preference and ultimately to aid employment, help business and industry located in this Commonwealth, attract new business and industry to this Commonwealth and provide additional tax revenue both from those receiving contracts and those employed by contractors, the General Assembly hereby declares that it is the policy of this Commonwealth to respond in like manner against those states that apply preferences or prohibitions by giving a similar offsetting preference to residents in this Commonwealth and bidders offering supplies manufactured in this Commonwealth and by prohibiting the purchase or use of certain supplies, in accordance with the provisions of this section. (c) Preference for supplies.-- In all procurements of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 (relating to small procurements), all Commonwealth agencies shall give preference to those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in this Commonwealth as against those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that gives or requires a preference to supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the other state for that particular supply. (d) Preference for resident bidders or offerors.-- When a contract for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 is to be awarded, a resident bidder or offeror shall be granted a preference as against a nonresident bidder or offeror from any state that gives or requires a preference to bidders or offerors from that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the state of the nonresident bidder or offeror. (e) Prohibition.-- For all contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, no Commonwealth agency shall specify for, use or procure any supplies which are produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that prohibits the specification for, use or procurement of these supplies in or on its public buildings or other works when these supplies are not produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. (f) Listing discriminating states.-- The department shall prepare a list of the states which apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or offerors or a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders or offerors and shall publish the list in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. When a state applies a new preference or prohibition, the department shall publish that information in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as an addition to the original list. (g) Inclusion in invitation for bids or request for proposals.-- In all invitations for bids and requests for proposals for the procurement of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, all Commonwealth agencies shall include a list of all the states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference favoring in-state supplies, bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 shall include a list of all states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference for in-state bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the purchasing agency for small procurements under section 514 shall also include a list of all states that apply a prohibition against certain supplies and shall inform potential bidders or offerors that they are prohibited from using supplies from those states. If a bid or proposal discloses that the bidder or offeror is offering supplies from a state which prohibits the use of out-of-state supplies, the bid or proposal shall be rejected. (h) Federal funds.-- The provisions of this section shall not be applicable when the application of this section may jeopardize the receipt of Federal funds. (i) Waiver.-- The provisions of this section may be waived when the head of the purchasing agency determines in writing that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth. (j) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Resident bidder or offeror.\" A person, partnership, corporation or other business entity authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth and having a bona fide establishment for transacting business in this Commonwealth at which it was transacting business on the date when bids or proposals for the public contract were first solicited.

      "text": "§ 510. Assessment for regulatory expenses upon public utilities. (a) Determination of assessment.-- Before November 1 of each year, the commission shall estimate its total expenditures in the administration of this part for the fiscal year beginning July of the following year, which estimate shall not exceed three-tenths of 1% of the total gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utilities and licensed entities under its jurisdiction for the preceding calendar year, except that the estimate may exceed this amount to reflect Federal funds received by the commission and funds received from other sources to perform functions that are unrelated to the regulation of public utilities and licensed entities. Such estimate shall be submitted to the Governor in accordance with section 610 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929. At the same time the commission submits its estimate to the Governor, the commission shall also submit that estimate to the General Assembly. The commission or its designated representatives shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Governor and the Senate and House Appropriations Committees regarding their estimates. The commission shall subtract from the final estimate: (1) The estimated fees to be collected pursuant to section 317 (relating to fees for services rendered by commission) during such fiscal year. (2) The estimated balance of the appropriation, specified in section 511 (relating to disposition, appropriation and disbursement of assessments and fees), to be carried over into such fiscal year from the preceding one. The remainder so determined, herein called the total assessment, shall be allocated to, and paid by, such public utilities in the manner prescribed. If the General Assembly fails to approve the commission's budget for the purposes of this part, by March 30, the commission shall assess public utilities on the basis of the last approved operating budget. At such time as the General Assembly approves the proposed budget the commission shall have the authority to make an adjustment in the assessments to reflect the approved budget. If, subsequent to the approval of the budget, the commission determines that a supplemental budget may be needed, the commission shall submit its request for that supplemental budget simultaneously to the Governor and the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. (b) Allocation of assessment.-- On or before March 31 of each year, every public utility shall file with the commission a statement under oath showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the preceding calendar year. If any public utility shall fail to file such statement on or before March 31, the commission shall estimate such revenues, which estimate shall be binding upon the public utility for the purposes of this section. For each fiscal year, the allocation shall be made as follows: (1) The commission shall determine for the preceding calendar year the amount of its expenditures directly attributable to the regulation of each group of utilities furnishing the same kind of service, and debit the amount so determined to such group. The commission may, for purposes of the assessment, deem utilities rendering water, sewer or water and sewer service, as defined in the definition of \"public utility\" in section 102 (relating to definitions), as a utility group. (2) The commission shall also determine for the preceding calendar year the balance of its expenditures, not debited as aforesaid, and allocate such balance to each group in the proportion which the gross intrastate operating revenues of such group for that year bear to the gross intrastate operating revenues of all groups for that year. (3) The commission shall then allocate the total assessment prescribed by subsection (a) to each group in the proportion which the sum of the debits made to it bears to the sum of the debits made to all groups. (4) Each public utility within a group shall then be assessed for and shall pay to the commission such proportion of the amount allocated to its group as the gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utility for the preceding calendar year bear to the total gross intrastate operating revenues of its group for that year. (5) (Repealed). (c) Notice, hearing and payment.-- The commission shall give notice by registered or certified mail to each public utility of the amount lawfully charged against it under the provisions of this section, which amount shall be paid by the public utility within 30 days of receipt of such notice, unless the commission specifies on the notices sent to all public utilities an installment plan of payment, in which case each public utility shall pay each installment on or before the date specified therefor by the commission. Within 15 days after receipt of such notice, the public utility against which such assessment has been made may file with the commission objections setting out in detail the grounds upon which the objector regards such assessment to be excessive, erroneous, unlawful or invalid. The commission, after notice to the objector, shall hold a hearing upon such objections. After such hearing, the commission shall record upon its minutes its findings on the objections and shall transmit to the objector, by registered or certified mail, notice of the amount, if any, charged against it in accordance with such findings, which amount or any installment thereof then due, shall be paid by the objector within ten days after receipt of notice of the findings of the commission with respect to such objections. If any payment prescribed by this subsection is not made as aforesaid, the commission may suspend or revoke certificates of public convenience, certify automobile registrations to the Department of Transportation for suspension or revocation or, through the Department of Justice, may institute an appropriate action at law for the amount lawfully assessed, together with any additional cost incurred by the commission or the Department of Justice by virtue of such failure to pay. (d) Suits by public utilities.-- No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the purpose of restraining or in anywise delaying the collection or payment of any assessment made under subsections (a), (b) and (c), but every public utility against which an assessment is made shall pay the same as provided in subsection (c). Any public utility making any such payment may, at any time within two years from the date of payment, sue the Commonwealth in an action at law to recover the amount paid, or any part thereof, upon the ground that the assessment was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, in whole or in part, provided objections, as hereinbefore provided, were filed with the commission, and payment of the assessment was made under protest either as to all or part thereof. In any action for recovery of any payments made under this section, the claimant shall be entitled to raise every relevant issue of law, but the findings of fact made by the commission, pursuant to this section, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. Any records, books, data, documents, and memoranda relating to the expenses of the commission shall be admissible in evidence in any court and shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of their contents. If it is finally determined in any such action that all or any part of the assessment for which payment was made under protest was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, the commission shall make a refund to the claimant out of the appropriation specified in section 511 as directed by the court. (e) Certain provisions not applicable.-- The provisions of this part relating to the judicial review of orders and determinations of the commission shall not be applicable to any findings, determinations, or assessments made under this section. The procedure in this section providing for the determination of the lawfulness of assessments and the recovery back of payments made pursuant to such assessment shall be exclusive of all other remedies and procedures. (f) Intent of section.-- It is the intent and purpose of this section that each public utility subject to this part shall advance to the commission its reasonable share of the cost of administering this part. The commission shall keep records of the costs incurred in connection with the administration and enforcement of this part or any other statute. The commission shall also keep a record of the manner in which it shall have computed the amount assessed against every public utility. Such records shall be open to inspection by all interested parties. The determination of such costs and assessments by the commission, and the records and data upon which the same are made, shall be considered prima facie correct; and in any proceeding instituted to challenge the reasonableness or correctness of any assessment under this section, the party challenging the same shall have the burden of proof. (g) Saving provision.-- This section does not affect or repeal any of the provisions of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), known as the \"Commonwealth Documents Law.\" (Dec. 18, 1980, P.L.1247, No.226, eff. imd.; July 10, 1986, P.L.1238, No.114, eff. imd.; Apr. 4, 1990, P.L.93, No.21, eff. 90 days; June 22, 1990, P.L.241, No.56, eff. 60 days; Dec. 30, 2002, P.L.2001, No.230, eff. 60 days; July 16, 2004, P.L.758, No.94; Oct. 22, 2014, P.L.2545, No.155, eff. 60 days) 2014 Amendment.

(b)(5). Section 25(1)(ii) of Act 94 provided that the repeal of subsec. (b)(5) shall take effect in 270 days or on the date of publication of the notice under section 24 of Act 94. The notice was published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin March 12, 2005, at 35 Pa.B. 1737.

(a) Applicability.-- Design professional services shall be procured as provided in this section except as authorized by sections 514 (relating to small procurements), 515 (relating to sole source procurement) and 516 (relating to emergency procurement). (b) Policy.-- It is the policy of this Commonwealth to publicly announce all requirements for design professional services and to award contracts for design professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the types of services required. There shall be a committee to review the qualifications, experience and work of design professionals seeking contracts with purchasing agencies. (c) Selection committees for Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities.-- Where they are authorized by law to act as purchasing agency for design professional services, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities shall each establish as many selection committees as the department deems appropriate and a procedure for the selection of committee members. (d) Selection committee for all other Commonwealth agencies.-- Except as provided for in subsection (c), all purchasing agencies shall use the selection committee appointed by the Governor which shall be composed of five members, none of whom shall be employees of the Commonwealth or hold any elective office or office in any political party. The members shall be architects, engineers or other persons knowledgeable in construction. The members shall serve for terms of two years and shall not be removed except for cause. Of the original members, three shall serve for terms of two years and two for terms of one year. Thereafter, all terms shall be for two years. Each member shall be reimbursed for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred incident to attendance at meetings and to assigned duties and also a per diem allowance in accordance with Commonwealth travel policies. (e) Procedure for selection committees.-- The selection committees shall use the procedure set forth in this subsection: (1) The committee shall give public notice of projects requiring design services and publicly recommend to the purchasing agency three qualified design professionals for each project. (2) If desired, the committee may conduct discussions with three or more professionals regarding anticipated design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment. The committee shall select, based upon criteria established by the head of the purchasing agency, no less than three design professionals deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. In exercising its responsibility, the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) An equitable distribution of contracts to design professionals. (ii) Particular capability to perform the design or construction services for the contract being considered. (iii) Geographic proximity of the design professional to the proposed facility. (iv) The design professional selected has the necessary available personnel to perform the services required by the project. (v) Any other relevant circumstances peculiar to the proposed contract. (f) Design professionals.-- Except as provided for in subsection (g), the head of the purchasing agency shall select design professionals as follows: (1) Where the amount of the base construction allocation is less than $20,000,000, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The fee to be paid to the appointed design professional may be established by the selection committee or may be negotiated at the discretion of the head of the purchasing agency. The $20,000,000 threshold shall be adjusted by the department to reflect the annual percentage change in the Composite Construction Cost Index of the United States Department of Commerce occurring in the one-year period ending December 31 each year. (2) Where the amount of base construction allocation is in excess of or equal to $20,000,000, as annually adjusted, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee to begin contract negotiations. The fee to be paid to the design professional and the terms of the contract between the design professional and the department shall be negotiated by the head of the purchasing agency. In negotiating the contract and the fee, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, uniqueness and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the appointed design professional, negotiations with that design professional shall be terminated, and the head of the purchasing agency shall commence negotiations with one of the other firms chosen by the selection committee. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the second firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall terminate negotiations with the second design professional and commence negotiation with the third firm. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall choose additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this subsection until an agreement is reached. (g) Selection method for Department of Transportation, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Protection and State-affiliated entities.-- In the event the Department of Transportation, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection or a State-affiliated entity otherwise authorized by law to use its own selection committee requires the services of a design professional, the head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall negotiate with the firm determined to be the highest qualified firm for design professional services at a fee which is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth. In making this decision, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee he determines to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The head of the purchasing agency shall then undertake negotiations with the firm he determines to be the second highest qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the third highest qualified firm. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the committee shall select additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

      "text": "§ 2802. Declaration of policy. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows: (1) Over the past 20 years, the Federal Government and State government have introduced competition in several industries that previously had been regulated as natural monopolies. (2) Many state governments are implementing or studying policies that would create a competitive market for the generation of electricity. (3) Because of advances in electric generation technology and Federal initiatives to encourage greater competition in the wholesale electric market, it is now in the public interest to permit retail customers to obtain direct access to a competitive generation market as long as safe and affordable transmission and distribution service is available at levels of reliability that are currently enjoyed by the citizens and businesses of this Commonwealth. (4) Rates for electricity in this Commonwealth are on average higher than the national average, and significant differences exist among the rates of Pennsylvania electric utilities. (5) Competitive market forces are more effective than economic regulation in controlling the cost of generating electricity. (6) The cost of electricity is an important factor in decisions made by businesses concerning locating, expanding and retaining facilities in this Commonwealth. (7) This Commonwealth must begin the transition from regulation to greater competition in the electricity generation market to benefit all classes of customers and to protect this Commonwealth's ability to compete in the national and international marketplace for industry and jobs. (8) In moving toward greater competition in the electricity generation market, the Commonwealth must resolve certain transitional issues in a manner that is fair to customers, electric utilities, investors, the employees of electric utilities, local communities, nonutility generators of electricity and other affected parties. (9) Electric service is essential to the health and well-being of residents, to public safety and to orderly economic development, and electric service should be available to all customers on reasonable terms and conditions. (10) The Commonwealth must, at a minimum, continue the protections, policies and services that now assist customers who are low-income to afford electric service. (11) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the electric system, ensure the continued provision of high-quality customer service and avoid economic dislocation, utilities shall consider the experience and expertise of their work force in moving towards competition. (12) The purpose of this chapter is to modify existing legislation and regulations and to establish standards and procedures in order to create direct access by retail customers to the competitive market for the generation of electricity while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system for all parties. Reliable electric service is of the utmost importance to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. Electric industry restructuring should ensure the reliability of the interconnected electric system by maintaining the efficiency of the transmission and distribution system. (13) Under current law and regulation there exists some competition in the wholesale market for the generation of electricity, but the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sale of electricity is provided generally by public utilities under bundled rates regulated by the commission. The procedures established under this chapter provide for a fair and orderly transition from the current regulated structure to a structure under which retail customers will have direct access to a competitive market for the generation and sale or purchase of electricity. (14) This chapter requires electric utilities to unbundle their rates and services and to provide open access over their transmission and distribution systems to allow competitive suppliers to generate and sell electricity directly to consumers in this Commonwealth. The generation of electricity will no longer be regulated as a public utility function except as otherwise provided for in this chapter. Electric generation suppliers will be required to obtain licenses, demonstrate financial responsibility and comply with such other requirements concerning service as the commission deems necessary for the protection of the public. (15) In establishing the standards for the transition to and creation of a competitive electric market, heretofore, public utilities generally have had an obligation to serve customers within their defined service territories; consistent with that obligation, have undertaken long-term investments in generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to meet the needs of their customers; and have entered into long-term power supply agreements as required by Federal law. In many instances, these investments and agreements have created costs which may not be recoverable in a competitive market. The commission is empowered under this chapter to determine the level of transition or stranded costs for each electric utility and to provide a mechanism, the competitive transition charge, for recovery of an appropriate amount of such costs in accordance with the standards established in this chapter. (16) It is in the public interest for the transmission and distribution of electricity to continue to be regulated as a natural monopoly subject to the jurisdiction and active supervision of the commission. Electric distribution companies should continue to be the provider of last resort in order to ensure the availability of universal electric service in this Commonwealth unless another provider of last resort is approved by the commission. (17) There are certain public purpose costs, including programs for low-income assistance, energy conservation and others, which have been implemented and supported by public utilities' bundled rates. The public purpose is to be promoted by continuing universal service and energy conservation policies, protections and services, and full recovery of such costs is to be permitted through a nonbypassable rate mechanism. (18) There are certain changes to a utility which will create transition costs to accomplish the move to a competitive market. These changes may entail the closure of facilities or reduction in employee levels. If such actions are to be undertaken, the utility must fully inform the commission of the impact of such decisions on local communities and on social services and of any tax implications of the actions. The utility is expected to discuss the transition to competition with its employees or their certified representatives and may provide severance, retraining, early retirement and outplacement services. Such transition costs may be recoverable under the competitive transition charge in section 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge). (19) All participants in the restructured electric industry are encouraged to coordinate their plans and transactions through an independent system operator or its functional equivalent. (20) Since continuing and ensuring the reliability of electric service depends on adequate generation and on conscientious inspection and maintenance of transmission and distribution systems, the independent system operator or its functional equivalent should set, and the commission shall set through regulations, inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement standards and enforce those standards. (21) Under Federal and State clean air laws and regulations, electricity generators located in states to the west and south of this Commonwealth are not subject to requirements as stringent as those which apply to generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the act of January 8, 1960 (1959 P.L.2119, No.787), known as the Air Pollution Control Act, operating in this Commonwealth and that different regions within this Commonwealth are subject to varying air emission requirements. Under some scenarios, competition among electricity generators located in different states and different regions within this Commonwealth could make it more difficult for areas in this Commonwealth to demonstrate attainment with Federal and State air quality standards. Since this result may be caused by the disparate requirements imposed by Federal and State law on generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act in this Commonwealth and generators located in other states, the General Assembly supports changes to Federal clean air laws and regulations that will protect Pennsylvania's environment and ensure that electricity generators and other \"persons\" as defined in section 3 of the Air Pollution Control Act located in this Commonwealth are not placed at an undue competitive disadvantage. The commission will consult with the Department of Environmental Protection regarding this issue during the transition to retail competition. Cross References.

      "text": "§ 2804. Standards for restructuring of electric industry. The following interdependent standards shall govern the commission's assessment and approval of each public utility's restructuring plan, oversight of the transition process and regulation of the restructured electric utility industry: (1) The commission shall ensure continuation of safe and reliable electric service to all consumers in the Commonwealth, including: (i) The maintenance of adequate reserve margins by electric suppliers in conformity with the standards required by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and the regional reliability council appropriate to each supplier, or any successors to those reliability entities, and in conformity with established industry standards and practices. (ii) The installation and maintenance of transmission and distribution facilities in conformity with established industry standards and practices, including the standards set forth in the National Electric Safety Code. (2) Consistent with the time line set forth in section 2806 (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates), the commission shall allow customers to choose among electric generation suppliers in a competitive generation market through direct access. Customers should be able to choose among alternatives such as firm and interruptible service, flexible pricing and alternate generation sources, including reasonable and fair opportunities to self-generate and interconnect. These alternatives may be provided by different electric generation suppliers. (3) The commission shall require the unbundling of electric utility services, tariffs and customer bills to separate the charges for generation, transmission and distribution. The commission may require the unbundling of other services. (4) The following caps on electric utility rates shall apply: (i) For a period of 54 months from the effective date of this chapter or until an electric distribution utility is no longer recovering its transition or stranded costs through a competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge and all the customers of an electric distribution utility can choose an alternative provider of electric generation, whichever is shorter: (A) the total charges of an electric distribution utility for service to any customer who purchases generation from that utility shall not exceed the total charges that have been approved by the commission for such service as of the effective date of this chapter; and (B) for customers who purchase generation from a supplier other than the electric distribution utility, the charges of the utility for non-generation services that are regulated as of the effective date of this chapter, exclusive of the competitive transition charge and intangible transition charge, shall not exceed the non-generation charges that have been approved by the commission for such service as of the effective date of this chapter. (ii) In addition to the rate cap set forth in subparagraph (i), for a period of nine years from the effective date of this chapter or until an electric distribution utility is no longer recovering its transition or stranded costs through a competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge and all customers of an electric distribution utility can choose an alternative provider of electric generation, whichever is shorter, the generation component of a utility's charges to customers who purchase generation from the utility, including the competitive transition charge and intangible transition charge, shall not exceed the generation component charged to the customers that has been approved by the commission for such service as of the effective date of this chapter. (iii) An electric distribution utility may seek, and the commission may approve, an exception to the limitations set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) only in any of the following circumstances: (A) The electric distribution utility meets the requirements for extraordinary rate relief under section 1308(e) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). (B) Either the electric distribution utility is required to begin payment under contracts with nonutility generation projects that have received commission orders, has been unable to mitigate such costs, such costs are not recoverable in a competitive generation market and such costs were not previously covered in the competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge, or the utility prudently incurs costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation of nonutility generating project obligations of the utility consistent with section 527 (relating to cogeneration rules and regulations) and such costs were not previously covered in the competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge. Costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation shall be recovered from ratepayers over a period not to exceed three years, unless the commission determines within its discretion to require a longer recovery period due to the magnitude of such costs, but shall be accounted for by the utility on a levelized basis over the total period in which the generation portion of the utility's rates are capped. (C) The electric distribution utility is subject to significant increases in the rates of Federal or State taxes or other significant changes in law or regulations that would not allow the utility to earn a fair rate of return. (D) The electric distribution utility is subject to significant increases in the unit rate of fuel for utility generation or the price of purchased power that are outside of the control of the utility and that would not allow the utility to earn a fair rate of return. (E) The electric distribution utility is directed by the commission or an independent system operator or its functional equivalent to make expenditures to repair or upgrade its transmission or distribution system. (F) The electric distribution utility seeks to increase its allowance for nuclear decommissioning costs to reflect new information not available at the time the utility's existing rates were determined, and such costs are not recoverable in the competitive generation market and are not covered in the competitive transition charge or intangible transition charge, and such costs would not allow the utility to earn a fair rate of return. (G) As permitted by paragraph (16). (iv) Consistent with the requirements of due process, the commission may expedite proceedings that invoke the provisions of subparagraph (iii). (v) If an electric distribution utility rolls its energy cost rate into base rates at a combined level that does not exceed its combined level of such rates which have been approved by the commission as of the effective date of this chapter, the utility shall not be required to reduce its capped rates below the capped level upon the complaint of any party if the commission determines that any excess earnings achieved under the cap are being utilized to mitigate transition or stranded costs for the benefit of ratepayers or to offset other known and measurable cost increases that would be recoverable under traditional ratemaking but are not included within the capped rates. (vi) This paragraph shall not apply to new services offered for the first time after the effective date of this chapter. (5) The commission may permit, but shall not require, an electric utility to divest itself of facilities or to reorganize its corporate structure. (6) Consistent with the provision of section 2806, the commission shall require that a public utility that owns or operates jurisdictional transmission and distribution facilities shall provide transmission and distribution service to all retail electric customers in their service territory and to electric cooperative corporations and electric generation suppliers, affiliated or nonaffiliated, on rates, terms of access and conditions that are comparable to the utility's own use of its system. (7) The commission shall require that restructuring of the electric utility industry be implemented in a manner that does not unreasonably discriminate against one customer class to the benefit of another. (8) The commission shall establish for each electric utility an appropriate cost-recovery mechanism which is designed to fully recover the electric utility's universal service and energy conservation costs over the life of these programs. (9) The commission shall ensure that universal service and energy conservation policies, activities and services are appropriately funded and available in each electric distribution territory. Policies, activities and services under this paragraph shall be funded in each electric distribution territory by nonbypassable, competitively neutral cost-recovery mechanisms that fully recover the costs of universal service and energy conservation services. The commission shall encourage the use of community-based organizations that have the necessary technical and administrative experience to be the direct providers of services or programs which reduce energy consumption or otherwise assist low-income customers to afford electric service. Programs under this paragraph shall be subject to the administrative oversight of the commission which will ensure that the programs are operated in a cost-effective manner. (10) The commission shall establish rates for jurisdictional transmission and distribution services and shall continue to regulate distribution services for new and existing customers in accordance with this chapter and Chapter 13 (relating to rates and rate making). (11) The time line for the transition to and phase-in of direct access to competitive electric generation shall be in accordance with section 2806. (12) The commission has the authority to order utility participation in retail access pilot programs as set forth in section 2806 and as further implemented or modified by the commission, with direct access to begin on April 1, 1997. The commission shall conduct milestone reviews of the transition to retail electric generation competition to assure a technically workable and equitable transition period. (13) Consistent with section 2808 (relating to competitive transition charge), the commission has the power and duty to approve a competitive transition charge for the recovery of transition or stranded costs it determines to be just and reasonable to recover from ratepayers. (14) The transition to a competitive generation market shall be orderly, protect electric system reliability, be fair to ratepayers and provide the investors in Pennsylvania electric utilities with a fair opportunity to fully recover the amount of transition or stranded costs that the commission determines to be just and reasonable. (15) At the time each utility files its restructuring plan with the commission, the utility shall submit an initial plan that sets forth how it shall meet its universal service and energy conservation obligations. (16) The following shall apply: (i) The commission shall issue regulations that permit the electric distribution company to recover any change in its State tax liability under sections 2806(h), 2809(c) (relating to requirements for electric generation suppliers) and 2810 (relating to revenue-neutral reconciliation) or in its liability under 52 Pa. Code §§ 69.51 through 69.56 (relating to inclusion of State taxes and gross receipts taxes in base rates) to the extent that the resulting rate does not exceed the rate cap established in this section except as provided in this chapter. (ii) With regard to any portion of the change in an electric distribution company's tax liability under section 2810 which would cause it to exceed the rate cap, the electric distribution company may file a single issue rate proceeding under section 1308(a) to recover that amount. The commission shall adjudicate, within 60 days, whether the resulting rates are just and reasonable. (iii) With regard to any portion of the change in an electric distribution company's tax liability under sections 2806(h) and 2809(c) which would cause it to exceed the price cap, upon certification to the commission by affidavit that the electric distribution company has not collected the taxes due pursuant to the tariff indemnification provisions required by section 2810(m) and that the electric distribution company and the Department of Revenue have not collected the taxes due pursuant to the other means set forth in sections 2806(g)(3)(i) and (ii) and 2809(c) to recover the taxes due and any interest thereon, the electric distribution utility shall be permitted to recover that amount in the State Tax Adjustment Surcharge.

(a) Other states.-- The commission shall take all necessary and appropriate steps to encourage interstate power pools to enhance competition and to complement industry restructuring on a regional basis. The Commonwealth, the commission and Pennsylvania electric utilities shall work with the Federal Government, other states in the region and interstate power pools to accomplish the goals of restructuring and to establish independent system operators or their functional equivalents to operate the transmission system and interstate power pools. The commission, Pennsylvania electric utilities and all electricity suppliers shall work with the Federal Government, other states in the region, the North American Electric Reliability Council and its regional coordinating councils or their successors, interstate power pools, and with the independent system operator or its functional equivalent to ensure the continued provision of adequate, safe and reliable electric service to the citizens and businesses of this Commonwealth. (b) Electric cooperatives, municipalities and other electric generation suppliers.-- (1) In order to make the benefits of competition in the generation and sale of electricity as widely available as possible to retail customers and to provide open, fair and nondiscriminatory access to all electric generation suppliers: (i) Consistent with 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 (relating to generation choice for customers of electric cooperatives), no electric cooperative or municipality which distributes electricity to end-use customers may utilize the transmission or distribution system of an electric utility regulated by the commission for the purpose of supplying electricity to an end-use customer unless the electric cooperative or municipality provides open and nondiscriminatory access and allows other electric generation suppliers to utilize its facilities, including any facilities it is entitled to provide to third parties pursuant to contract, to make sales to the end-use customers it serves. A borough may prohibit electric generation suppliers from serving end-use customers within its borough limits; however, such a borough shall be prohibited from providing generation service to end-use customers outside of its borough limits which it did not serve prior to the effective date of this chapter. (ii) The commission shall require any electric cooperative seeking a certificate under 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 to provide open and nondiscriminatory access to its transmission and distribution facilities as a condition to the granting of the certificate. (iii) The reliability of the transmission service provided to electric cooperative corporations must be comparable to the reliability which the transmission supplier provides at the wholesale level. (2) No electric utility regulated by the commission and no affiliate of such electric utility may use the distribution system of another electric utility regulated by the commission or make sales to end-use customers in another electric utility's service territory unless the commission has approved a restructuring plan for the supplying electric utility which provides for direct access comparable to the direct access provided under the approved plan of the electric utility operating the distribution system in the location where the supplying electric utility seeks to sell electricity to an end-use customer. No electric utility regulated by the commission and no affiliate of such electric utility may use the distribution system of an electric cooperative corporation or make sales to end-use customers in the territory of an electric cooperative corporation unless the commission has approved a restructuring plan for the supplying electric utility.

      "text": "§ 2807. Duties of electric distribution companies. (a) General rule.-- Each electric distribution company shall maintain the integrity of the distribution system at least in conformity with the National Electric Safety Code and such other standards practiced by the industry in a manner sufficient to provide safe and reliable service to all customers connected to the system consistent with this title and the commission's regulations. In performing such duties, the electric distribution company shall implement procedures to require all electric generation suppliers to deliver energy to the electric distribution company at locations and in amounts which are adequate to meet the energy supplier's obligations to its customers. Subject to commission approval, the electric distribution company may require that the customer install, at the customer's expense, enhanced metering capability sufficient to match the energy delivered by the electric generation suppliers with consumption by the customer. (b) Procedures for review by the commission.-- There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the electric distribution company has the ability to receive energy at all points on its system sufficient to meet the needs of all electric generation suppliers' customers on its system. The electric distribution company shall not have an obligation to install nonstandard facilities, either as to type or location, for the purpose of receiving energy from the energy supplier unless the energy supplier or its customer pays the full cost of these facilities. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the electric distribution company from upgrading its system to meet changing customer requirements consistent with the requirements of section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities), and the commission may establish incentive programs to encourage such system upgrades. Disputes concerning facilities shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission and may be initiated by the filing of a complaint under section 701 (relating to complaints) by the electric generation supplier or the customer. (c) Customer billing.-- Subject to the right of an end-use customer to choose to receive separate bills from its electric generation supplier, the electric distribution company may be responsible for billing customers for all electric services, consistent with the regulations of the commission, regardless of the identity of the provider of those services. (1) Customer bills shall contain unbundled charges sufficient to enable the customer to determine the basis for those charges. (2) If services are provided by an entity other than the electric distribution company, the entity that provides those services shall furnish to the electric distribution company billing data sufficient to enable the electric distribution company to bill customers. (3) The electric distribution company shall not be required to forward payment to entities providing services to customers, and on whose behalf the electric distribution company is billing those customers, before the electric distribution company has received payment for those services from customers. (d) Consumer protections and customer service.-- The electric distribution company shall continue to provide customer service functions consistent with the regulations of the commission, including meter reading, complaint resolution and collections. Customer services shall, at a minimum, be maintained at the same level of quality under retail competition. (1) The commission shall establish regulations to ensure that an electric distribution company does not change a customer's electricity supplier without direct oral confirmation from the customer of record or written evidence of the customer's consent to a change of supplier. (2) The commission shall establish regulations to require each electric distribution company, electricity supplier, marketer, aggregator and broker to provide adequate and accurate customer information to enable customers to make informed choices regarding the purchase of all electricity services offered by that provider. Information shall be provided to consumers in an understandable format that enables consumers to compare prices and services on a uniform basis. (3) Prior to the implementation of any restructuring plan under section 2806 (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates), each electric distribution company, in conjunction with the commission, shall implement a consumer education program informing customers of the changes in the electric utility industry. The program shall provide consumers with information necessary to help them make appropriate choices as to their electric service. The education program shall be subject to approval by the commission. (e) Obligation to serve.-- A default service provider's obligation to provide electric generation supply service following the expiration of a generation rate cap specified under section 2804(4) (relating to standards for restructuring of electric industry) or a restructuring plan under section 2806(f) is revised as follows: (1) While an electric distribution company collects either a competitive transition charge or an intangible transition charge or until 100% of its customers have choice, whichever is longer, the electric distribution company shall continue to have the full obligation to serve, including the connection of customers, the delivery of electric energy and the production or acquisition of electric energy for customers. (2) (Deleted by amendment). (3) (Deleted by amendment). (3.1) Following the expiration of an electric distribution company's obligation to provide electric generation supply service to retail customers at capped rates, if a customer contracts for electric generation supply service and the chosen electric generation supplier does not provide the service or if a customer does not choose an alternative electric generation supplier, the default service provider shall provide electric generation supply service to that customer pursuant to a commission-approved competitive procurement plan. The electric power acquired shall be procured through competitive procurement processes and shall include one or more of the following: (i) Auctions. (ii) Requests for proposal. (iii) Bilateral agreements entered into at the sole discretion of the default service provider which shall be at prices which are: (A) no greater than the cost of obtaining generation under comparable terms in the wholesale market, as determined by the commission at the time of execution of the contract; or (B) consistent with a commission-approved competition procurement process. Any agreement between affiliated parties shall be subject to review and approval of the commission under Chapter 21 (relating to relations with affiliated interests). In no case shall the cost of obtaining generation from any affiliated interest be greater than the cost of obtaining generation under comparable terms in the wholesale market at the time of execution of the contract. (3.2) The electric power procured pursuant to paragraph (3.1) shall include a prudent mix of the following: (i) Spot market purchases. (ii) Short-term contracts. (iii) Long-term purchase contracts, entered into as a result of an auction, request for proposal or bilateral contract that is free of undue influence, duress or favoritism, of more than four and not more than 20 years. The default service provider shall have sole discretion to determine the source and fuel type. Long-term purchase contracts under this subparagraph may not constitute more than 25% of the default service provider's projected default service load unless the commission, after a hearing, determines for good cause that a greater portion of load is necessary to achieve least cost procurement. This subparagraph shall not apply to contracts executed under paragraph (5). (3.3) The commission may determine that a contract is required to be extended for a longer term of up to 20 years, if the extension is necessary to ensure adequate and reliable service at least cost to customers over time. (3.4) The prudent mix of contracts entered into pursuant to paragraphs (3.2) and (3.3) shall be designed to ensure: (i) Adequate and reliable service. (ii) The least cost to customers over time. (iii) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (3.1). (3.5) Except as set forth in paragraph (5)(ii), the provisions of this section shall apply to any type of energy purchased by a default service provider to provide electric generation supply service, including energy or alternative energy portfolio standards credits required to be purchased under the act of November 30, 2004 (P.L.1672, No.213), known as the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act. The commission shall apply paragraph (3.4) to comparable types of energy sources. (3.6) The default service provider shall file a plan for competitive procurement with the commission and obtain commission approval of the plan considering the standards in paragraphs (3.1), (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4) before the competitive process is implemented. The commission shall hold hearings as necessary on the proposed plan. If the commission fails to issue a final order on the plan within nine months of the date that the plan is filed, the plan shall be deemed to be approved and the default service provider may implement the plan as filed. Costs incurred through an approved competitive procurement plan shall be deemed to be the least cost over time as required under paragraph (3.4)(ii). (3.7) At the time the commission evaluates the plan and prior to approval, in determining if the default electric service provider's plan obtains generation supply at the least cost, the commission shall consider the default service provider's obligation to provide adequate and reliable service to customers and that the default service provider has obtained a prudent mix of contracts to obtain least cost on a long-term, short-term and spot market basis and shall make specific findings which shall include the following: (i) The default service provider's plan includes prudent steps necessary to negotiate favorable generation supply contracts. (ii) The default service provider's plan includes prudent steps necessary to obtain least cost generation supply contracts on a long-term, short-term and spot market basis. (iii) Neither the default service provider nor its affiliated interest has withheld from the market any generation supply in a manner that violates Federal law. (3.8) Notwithstanding sections 508 (relating to power of the commission to vary, reform and revise contracts) and 2102 (relating to approval of contracts with affiliated interests), the commission may modify contracts or disallow costs only when the party seeking recovery of the costs of a procurement plan is, after hearing, found to be at fault for the following: (i) not complying with the commission-approved procurement plan; or (ii) the commission of fraud, collusion or market manipulation with regard to these contracts. (3.9) The default service provider shall have the right to recover on a full and current basis, pursuant to a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments), all reasonable costs incurred under this section and a commission-approved competitive procurement plan. (4) If a customer that chooses an alternative supplier and subsequently desires to return to the local distribution company for generation service, the local distribution company shall treat that customer exactly as it would any new applicant for energy service. (5) (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (3.1), the electric distribution company or commission-approved alternative supplier may, in its sole discretion, offer large customers with a peak demand of 15 megawatts or greater at one meter at a location in its service territory any negotiated rate for service at all of the customers' locations within the service territory for any duration agreed upon by the electric distribution company or commission-approved alternative supplier and the large customer. The commission shall permit, but shall not require, an electric distribution company or commission-approved alternative supplier to provide service to large customers under this paragraph. Contract rates entered into under this paragraph shall be subject to review by the commission in order to ensure that all costs related to the rates are borne by the parties to the contract and that no costs related to the rates are borne by other customers or customer classes. If no costs related to the rates are borne by other customers or customer classes, the commission shall approve the contract within 90 days of its filing, or it shall be deemed approved by operation of law upon expiration of the 90 days. Information submitted under this paragraph shall be subject to the commission's procedures for the filing of confidential and proprietary information. (ii) For purposes of providing service under this paragraph to customers with a peak demand of 20 megawatts or greater at one meter at a location within that distribution company's service territory, an electric distribution company that has completed its restructuring transition period as of the effective date of this paragraph may, in its sole discretion, acquire an interest in a generation facility or construct a generation facility specifically to meet the energy requirements of the customers, including the electric requirements of the customers' other billing locations within its service territory. The electric distribution company must commence construction of the generation facility or contract to acquire the generation interest within three years after the effective date of this paragraph, except that the electric distribution company may add to the generation facilities it commenced construction or contracted to acquire after this three-year period to serve additional load of customers for whom it commenced construction or contracted to acquire generation within three years. Nothing in this paragraph requires or authorizes the commission to require an electric distribution company to commence construction or acquire an interest in a generation facility. The electric distribution company's interest in the generation facility it built or contracted to acquire shall be no larger than necessary to meet peak demand of customers served under this subparagraph. During times when the customer's demand is less than the electric distribution company's generation interest, the electric distribution company may sell excess power on the wholesale market. At no time shall the costs associated with the generating facility interests be included in rate base or otherwise reflected in rates. The generation facility interests shall not be commission-regulated assets. (6) A default service plan approved by the commission prior to the effective date of this section shall remain in effect through its approved term. At its sole discretion, the default service provider may propose amendments to its approved plan that are consistent with this section, and the commission shall issue a decision whether to approve or disapprove the proposed amendments within nine months of the date that the amendments are filed. If the commission fails to issue a final order within nine months, the amendments shall be deemed to be approved and the default service provider may implement the amendments as filed. (7) The default service provider shall offer residential and small business customers a generation supply service rate that shall change no more frequently than on a quarterly basis. All default service rates shall be reviewed by the commission to ensure that the costs of providing service to each customer class are not subsidized by any other class. (f) Smart meter technology and time of use rates.-- (1) Within nine months after the effective date of this paragraph, electric distribution companies shall file a smart meter technology procurement and installation plan with the commission for approval. The plan shall describe the smart meter technologies the electric distribution company proposes to install in accordance with paragraph (2). (2) Electric distribution companies shall furnish smart meter technology as follows: (i) Upon request from a customer that agrees to pay the cost of the smart meter at the time of the request. (ii) In new building construction. (iii) In accordance with a depreciation schedule not to exceed 15 years. (3) Electric distribution companies shall, with customer consent, make available direct meter access and electronic access to customer meter data to third parties, including electric generation suppliers and providers of conservation and load management services. (4) In no event shall lost or decreased revenues by an electric distribution company due to reduced electricity consumption or shifting energy demand be considered any of the following: (i) A cost of smart meter technology recoverable under a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307(b), except that decreased revenues and reduced energy consumption may be reflected in the revenue and sales data used to calculate rates in a distribution rate base rate proceeding filed under section 1308 (relating to voluntary changes in rates). (ii) A recoverable cost. (5) By January 1, 2010, or at the end of the applicable generation rate cap period, whichever is later, a default service provider shall submit to the commission one or more proposed time-of-use rates and real-time price plans. The commission shall approve or modify the time-of-use rates and real-time price plan within six months of submittal. The default service provider shall offer the time-of-use rates and real-time price plan to all customers that have been provided with smart meter technology under paragraph (2)(iii). Residential or commercial customers may elect to participate in time-of-use rates or real-time pricing. The default service provider shall submit an annual report to the price programs and the efficacy of the programs in affecting energy demand and consumption and the effect on wholesale market prices. (6) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to an electric distribution company with 100,000 or fewer customers. (7) An electric distribution company may recover reasonable and prudent costs of providing smart meter technology under paragraph (2)(ii) and (iii), as determined by the commission. This paragraph includes annual depreciation and capital costs over the life of the smart meter technology and the cost of any system upgrades that the electric distribution company may require to enable the use of the smart meter technology which are incurred after the effective date of this paragraph, less operating and capital cost savings realized by the electric distribution company from the installation and use of the smart meter technology. Smart meter technology shall be deemed to be a new service offered for the first time under section 2804(4)(vi). An electric distribution company may recover smart meter technology costs: (i) through base rates, including a deferral for future base rate recovery of current basis with carrying charge as determined by the commission; or (ii) on a full and current basis through a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"smart meter technology\" means technology, including metering technology and network communications technology capable of bidirectional communication, that records electricity usage on at least an hourly basis, including related electric distribution system upgrades to enable the technology. The technology shall provide customers with direct access to and use of price and consumption information. The technology shall also: (1) Directly provide customers with information on their hourly consumption. (2) Enable time-of-use rates and real-time price programs. (3) Effectively support the automatic control of the customer's electricity consumption by one or more of the following as selected by the customer: (i) the customer; (ii) the customer's utility; or (iii) a third party engaged by the customer or the customer's utility.

      "text": "§ 2808. Competitive transition charge. (a) General rule.-- To provide each electric utility with an opportunity to recover its transition or stranded costs following the commission's determination under subsection (c), every customer accessing the transmission or distribution network shall pay a competitive transition charge to the electric distribution company in whose certificated territory that customer is located. The costs to be recovered shall be allocated to customer classes in a manner that does not shift interclass or intraclass costs and maintains consistency with the allocation methodology for utility production plant accepted by the commission in the electric utility's most recent base rate proceeding. If a customer installs on-site generation which operates in parallel with other generation on the public utility's system and which significantly reduces the customer's purchases of electricity through the transmission and distribution network, the customer's fully allocated share of transition or stranded costs shall be recovered from the customer through a competitive transition charge. The recovery of transition or stranded costs associated with existing generating facilities is contingent on continued operation at reasonable availability levels of the generation facilities for which recovery has been approved, except when the generation facility is uneconomic on a production cost basis because of the transition to a competitive market. (b) Period for collecting competitive transition charge.-- The competitive transition charge shall be included on bills to customers for a period not to exceed nine years from the effective date of this chapter unless an alternative payment methodology is mutually agreed upon by the customer and the utility or unless the commission in its discretion and for good cause shown orders an alternative payment period. In establishing the length of the period for collection of the competitive transition charge, the commission shall consider the effect on the ability of the Commonwealth to compete in attracting industry and jobs, on the financial health of electric utilities and other relevant factors. (c) Determination of competitive transition charge.-- In determining the level of transition or stranded costs that an electric utility may recover through the competitive transition charge, the commission shall apply the following principles: (1) The commission shall allow recovery of regulatory assets and other deferred charges typically recoverable under current regulatory practice, the unfunded portion of the utility's projected nuclear generating plant decommissioning costs and cost obligations under contracts with nonutility generating projects that have received a commission order. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring an electric utility or a nonutility generating project to enter into an arrangement to buy down, buy out and terminate or otherwise restructure a contract or as authorizing the commission to require a utility to pursue such an arrangement with a nonutility generating project. (2) The commission shall allow recovery of an electric utility's prudently incurred costs related to cancellation, buyout, buydown or renegotiation of nonutility generating projects consistent with section 527 (relating to cogeneration rules and regulations). (3) The commission shall determine the level of other generation-related transition or stranded costs that may be recovered through the competitive transition charge. (4) The commission shall consider the extent to which the electric utility has undertaken efforts to mitigate generation-related transition or stranded costs by appropriate means in a manner that is reasonable under all of the circumstances, including consideration of whether mitigation has been commensurate with the magnitude of the electric utility's generation-related transition or stranded costs. During the transition period, electric utilities shall have the duty to mitigate generation-related transition or stranded costs to the extent practicable. Efforts may include the following: (i) Acceleration of depreciation and amortization of existing rate base generation assets. (ii) Minimization of new capital spending for existing rate base generation assets. (iii) Reallocation of depreciation reserves to existing rate base generation assets. (iv) Reduction of book assets by application of new proceeds of any sale of idle or underutilized existing rate base generation assets. (v) Maximization of market revenues from existing rate base generation assets. (vi) Issuance of securitized debt pursuant to the provisions of section 2812 (relating to approval of transition bonds). (5) Of equal importance to the mitigation efforts under paragraph (4), the commission shall consider efforts undertaken over time, prior to the enactment of this chapter, to reduce or moderate customer rate levels while maintaining safe and efficient operations. (d) Commission review.-- As a component of its restructuring plan, each electric utility shall file with the commission a recovery plan, including a proposed competitive transition charge and supporting documentation. In evaluating a recovery plan and any proposed competitive transition charge, the commission shall schedule open evidentiary hearings with proper notice and opportunity for all parties to cross-examine witnesses as necessary. (e) Use of transition bonds.-- After the effective date of this chapter, a utility may apply to the commission for a qualified rate order under section 2812 for some or all of its transition or stranded costs. (1) In evaluating a utility application under this subsection, the commission shall schedule hearings, as necessary. (2) If the commission issues a qualified rate order under section 2812 and if the transition bonds approved by that order are successfully issued, then: (i) the utility shall impose and collect through its customer bills the intangible transition charges approved by that qualified rate order; and (ii) simultaneously, either the utility's rates for electric service or the utility's competitive transition charges shall be reduced by an amount equal to the revenue requirement of the transition or stranded costs for which transition bonds have been successfully issued. (f) Annual revenue.-- Consistent with section 1307(e) (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments), the commission shall establish procedures for the annual review of the competitive transition charge. The review shall reconcile the annual revenues received from the charge with the annual amortization of transition or stranded costs approved by the commission under this section. The commission shall adjust the competitive transition charge based upon underrecovery or overrecovery of the annual amortization amount. Cross References.

(a) License requirement.-- No person or corporation, including municipal corporations which choose to provide service outside their municipal limits except to the extent provided prior to the effective date of this chapter, brokers and marketers, aggregators and other entities, shall engage in the business of an electric generation supplier in this Commonwealth unless the person or corporation holds a license issued by the commission. Consistent with 15 Pa.C.S. Ch. 74 (relating to generation choice for customers of electric cooperatives), electric cooperative corporations must possess a certificate for service to supply generation services beyond their territorial limits. (b) License application and issuance.-- An application for an electric generation supplier license must be made to the commission in writing, be verified by oath or affirmation and be in such form and contain such information as the commission may by its regulations require. A license shall be issued to any qualified applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the service covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing and able to perform properly the service proposed and to conform to the provisions of this title and the lawful orders and regulations of the commission under this title, including the commission's regulations regarding standards and billing practices, and that the proposed service, to the extent authorized by the license, will be consistent with the public interest and the policy declared in this chapter; otherwise, such application shall be denied. (c) Financial responsibility.-- (1) In order to ensure the safety and reliability of the generation of electricity in this Commonwealth, no energy supplier license shall be issued or remain in force unless the holder complies with all of the following: (i) Furnishes a bond or other security approved by the commission in form and amount to ensure the financial responsibility of the electric generation supplier and the supply of electricity at retail in accordance with contracts, agreements or arrangements. (ii) Certifies to the commission that it will pay and in subsequent years has paid the full amount of taxes imposed by Articles II and XI of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971, and any tax imposed by this chapter. (iii) Provides the commission with the address of the participant's principal office in this Commonwealth or the address of the participant's registered agent in this Commonwealth, the latter being the address at which the participant may be served process. (iv) Agrees that it shall be subject to all taxes imposed by the Tax Reform Code of 1971 and any tax imposed by this chapter. Failure of an electricity supplier to pay a tax referred to in this paragraph or to otherwise comply with the provisions of this paragraph shall be cause for the commission to revoke the license of the electricity supplier. (2) If an electricity supplier other than an electric distribution company does not pay the tax imposed upon gross receipts under section 1101 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 or this chapter, the electric distribution company to whose retail customer the electricity supplier provided generation service shall remit the unpaid tax, as a tax on the use of electricity in this Commonwealth, to the Department of Revenue and may collect or seek reimbursement of the tax so paid from the electricity provider or any other appropriate party that used the electricity in this Commonwealth. The department shall collect and enforce the use tax herein provided under section 1102 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. Failure of the electric distribution company to pay the amount within 30 days after notice provided by the department shall cause interest to be imposed on the electric distribution company in accordance with Article XI of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. Interest shall be calculated from the 31st day after the department gives the notice required in this paragraph. An electric distribution company or other appropriate person may challenge the imposition of the tax and interest by filing a petition with the department not later than 30 days after the date on which the tax became due. (d) Transferability of licenses.-- No license issued under this chapter may be transferred without prior commission approval. (e) Form of regulation of electric generation suppliers.-- The commission may forbear from applying requirements of this part which it determines are unnecessary due to competition among electric generation suppliers. In regulating the service of electric generation suppliers, the commission shall impose requirements necessary to ensure that the present quality of service provided by electric utilities does not deteriorate, including assuring that adequate reserve margins of electric supply are maintained and assuring that 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service) are maintained. (f) Availability of the services of brokers and marketers or aggregators.-- Prior to approving the licensure of any broker and marketer or aggregator, the commission shall set forth standards to ensure that all retail customer classes may choose to purchase electricity through a broker and marketer or aggregator. The commission shall also ensure that brokers, marketers and aggregators comply with 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56. (g) Annual fees.-- The commission may establish, by order or rule, on a reasonable cost basis, fees to be charged for annual activities related to the oversight of electric generation suppliers.

      "text": "§ 2810. Revenue-neutral reconciliation. (a) General intent of revenue-neutral reconciliation.-- It is the intention of the General Assembly that the restructuring of the electric industry be accomplished in a manner that allows Pennsylvania to enjoy the benefits of competition, promotes the competitiveness of Pennsylvania's electric utilities and maintains revenue neutrality to the Commonwealth. This section is not intended to cause a shift in proportional tax obligations among customer classes or individual electric distribution companies. It is the intention of the General Assembly to establish this revenue replacement at a level necessary to recoup losses that may result from the restructuring of the electric industry and the transition thereto. (b) Imposition.-- (1) For tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 1999, a tax at the rate provided in subsection (c) is imposed upon the gross receipts of electric distribution companies and electric generation suppliers. (2) A tax at the rate provided in subsection (c) is imposed upon the gross receipts of any municipality owned or operated public utility or of any public utility service furnished by any municipality. Gross receipts shall be exempt from the tax to the extent that gross receipts are derived from sales of electric energy inside the limits of the municipality owning or operating the public utility or furnishing the public utility service. (3) A tax at the rate provided in subsection (c) is imposed upon the gross receipts derived from any electric cooperative owned or operated public utility or from any public utility service furnished by any electric cooperative. Gross receipts shall be exempt from the tax to the extent that gross receipts are derived from sales for resale or sales of electric energy within the limits of its service territory as set forth in 15 Pa.C.S. § 7406 (relating to competition by electric cooperatives). (c) Rate.-- (1) By December 1, 1998, and each October 1 thereafter until and including October 1, 2002, the Secretary of Revenue shall publish the rate of tax as provided in paragraph (2) in the form of a notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and the rate shall apply to the tax imposed by subsection (b) for the period beginning the next January 1. The tax rate published on October 1, 2002, shall continue in force without further adjustment. If the commission determines under section 2806(c) (relating to implementation, pilot programs and performance-based rates) to extend the transition period by more than six months, the requirement for an annual adjustment of the tax rate shall be extended by one additional year. The secretary shall also certify the rate calculated to the majority and minority chairs of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate and the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives and detail the calculations of the rate. (2) The secretary shall calculate the rate for the periods beginning on and after January 1, 1999, in the manner set forth in this paragraph: (i) Multiply the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total kilowatt hours of electricity distributed for ultimate consumption in Pennsylvania in the preceding calendar year as certified by the commission and the denominator of which is the total kilowatt hours of electricity distributed for ultimate consumption in Pennsylvania in the calendar year 1995 as certified by the commission. (ii) From the product derived under subparagraph (i), subtract the total cash payments made to the department during the Commonwealth's preceding fiscal year on account of affected taxes actually paid by each electric distribution company and electric generation supplier and by any other entity, including a successor, whose affected taxes are contained in the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base. (iii) Divide the difference derived under subparagraph (ii) by the total gross receipts in the preceding calendar year as certified by the commission to determine the tax rate. The tax rate under this subparagraph shall be a decimal rounded to three places. (3) On August 1, 2000, August 1, 2001, and August 1, 2002, the department shall deliver a report to the General Assembly and the Governor that shall describe the dynamic economic effect upon the affected taxes due to electric utility restructuring. It is the purpose of this report to provide the General Assembly and the Governor with information to determine whether it is appropriate to consider modifying the calculation described in paragraph (2) to reflect additional tax revenues, if any, resulting from the dynamic economic effects upon the affected taxes. (4) If the effective rate for any affected tax is different from the effective rate for such affected tax in the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base, an adjustment shall be made to the computation of the rate of tax under paragraph (2) by multiplying that portion of the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base attributable to the affected tax by a fraction, the numerator of which is the effective rate of the affected tax for the preceding fiscal year and the denominator of which is the effective rate of tax of the affected tax in the base fiscal year. (5) For negative rates: (i) If the rate of tax calculated for a tax year prior to the tax year beginning January 1, 2004, or January 1, 2005, in the event of an extension by more than six months by the commission as provided in section 2806(c) is negative, a credit equal to the negative tax rate for such tax year multiplied by the taxable gross receipts for that tax year shall be allowed against the taxpayer's liability for any tax for that tax year imposed under Article XI of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971. (ii) If the rate of tax calculated as the final adjustment is negative for the tax period beginning January 1, 2003, or January 1, 2004, in the event of an extension by more than six months by the commission as provided in section 2806(c), the rate of tax imposed by section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 for the tax years beginning January 1, 2004, and thereafter, or January 1, 2005, and thereafter, in the event of an extension by more than six months, shall be adjusted and set as follows: the tax rate expressed as a decimal rounded to three positions shall be subtracted from .044 or the current rate imposed under section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 to determine the adjusted tax rate. The adjusted tax rate shall be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. (6) Information to be provided to the department or the commission shall be as follows: (i) To ensure the identification of cash payments for purposes of subsection (d), the commission shall require any licensee, electric distribution company, electric generation supplier or other person affected to disclose on its license application, renewal or transfer its State tax account or similar number relative to any of the taxes specified. (ii) The commission shall report and certify to the secretary of the department by August 1, 1998, and each August 1 thereafter the total amount of electricity distributed for ultimate consumption in this Commonwealth during the previous two calendar years and the total gross receipts for the past year. (iii) As a condition of licensure, the commission shall require each electric distribution company and electric generation supplier to report their annual gross receipts in this Commonwealth. (iv) For purposes of enforcing sections 2806 and 2809 (relating to requirements for electric generation suppliers) as they relate to the payment of State taxes, an applicant for the grant, renewal or transfer of a license issued under this title shall, by filing an application with the commission, waive confidentiality with respect to State tax information regarding the applicant in the possession of the department, regardless of the source of the information, and shall consent to the department providing that information to the commission. (7) (Repealed). (d) Payment of tax and reports.-- The tax imposed under subsection (b) shall be paid within the time prescribed by law. For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the tax, the treasurer or other appropriate officer of the taxpayer shall transmit to the department by March 15 an annual report, and under oath or affirmation, of the amount of gross receipts received by the taxpayer during the prior calendar year. The treasurer or other appropriate officer of the taxpayer liable to report or pay taxes imposed under subsection (b), except municipalities and cooperatives, shall transmit to the department by March 15 a tentative report for the prior calendar year. The tentative report shall set forth all of the following: (i) The amount of gross receipts received in the period of 12 months next preceding and reported in the annual report. (ii) The gross receipts received in the first three months of the current calendar year. (iii) Other information as the department may require. (e) Tax computation.-- Upon the date its tentative report is required to be made, the taxpayer making a tentative report shall transmit the report to the department on account of the tax due for the current calendar year and compute and make payment of the tentative tax with the report under section 3003 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. (f) Time to file reports.-- The time for filing annual reports may be extended, estimated settlements may be made by the department if reports are not filed, and the penalties for failing to file reports and pay the taxes imposed under subsection (b) shall be as prescribed by the laws defining the powers and duties of the department. If the works of a taxpayer are operated by another taxpayer, the taxes imposed under subsection (b) shall be apportioned between the taxpayers in accordance with the terms of their respective leases or agreements. For the payment of the apportioned taxes, the Commonwealth shall first look to the taxpayer operating the works. Upon payment by that taxpayer, no other taxpayer shall be held liable for any tax imposed under subsection (b). (g) Timely mailing treated as timely filing and payment.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of any State tax law to the contrary, whenever payment of all or any portion of a State tax is required by law to be received by the department or other agency of the Commonwealth by a day certain, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have complied with that law if the letter transmitting payment of the tax which has been received by the department is postmarked by the United States Postal Service on or prior to the final day on which the payment is to be received. (h) Procedure, enforcement and penalties.-- Parts III, IV, VI and VII of Article IV and Article XXX of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 shall apply to this section insofar as they are consistent with this section and applicable to the tax imposed under subsection (b). Notwithstanding the provisions of section 403(d) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, if the officers of any corporation subject to tax under this chapter neglect or refuse to make a report as required in this chapter or knowingly make a false report, the department shall add to the tax determined to be due a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due for each month or fraction of a month until the penalty has reached 25% and thereafter a penalty of 1% of the amount of tax due for each month or fraction of a month. Penalties added to the tax shall not bear interest. (i) Electric light, waterpower and hydroelectric utilities.-- The terms \"electric light company,\" \"waterpower company\" and \"hydro-electric company,\" as used in section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, shall be deemed to include electric distribution companies and electric generation suppliers. (j) Sales of electric energy.-- Retail sales of electric generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electric energy, dispatching services, customer services, competitive transition charges, intangible transition charges and universal service and energy conservation charges and such other retail sales in this Commonwealth the receipts of which, if bundled, would have been deemed to be sales of electric energy prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be deemed sales of electric energy for purposes of section 1101 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. The phrases \"doing business in this Commonwealth\" and \"engaged in electric light and power business, waterpower business and hydro-electric business in this Commonwealth,\" as such terms are used in section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 and in this chapter, shall be construed to include the direct or indirect engaging in, transacting or conducting of activity in this Commonwealth for the purpose of establishing or maintaining a market for the sales of electric energy and include obtaining a license or certification from the commission to supply electric energy. Retail sales of generation shall be deemed to occur at the meter of the retail consumer. (k) Electric cooperatives.-- Section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 shall apply to electric cooperatives and impose a tax upon the gross receipts derived from any electric cooperative owned or operated public utility or from any public utility service furnished by any electric cooperative. Gross receipts shall be exempt from the tax to the extent that the gross receipts are derived from sales for resale or sales of electric energy within the limits of its service territory as set forth in 15 Pa.C.S. § 7406. (l) Provisions to be construed with utilities gross receipts tax.-- Subsections (i), (j) and (k) shall be construed in conjunction with Article XI of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 and shall be effective for tax years beginning January 1, 1997, and thereafter. (m) Indemnification.-- The electric distribution utility company's tariff shall provide that, if an electric distribution company becomes liable under sections 2806(g) and 2809(c) for State taxes not paid by an electric generation supplier, that electric generation supplier shall indemnify the electric distribution company for the amount of the liability so imposed upon the electric distribution utility. (n) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Affected taxes.\" The taxes imposed under Articles II, IV, VI and XI and section 2301(f) of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971. \"Base fiscal year.\" The year beginning on July 1, 1995, and ending on June 30, 1996. \"Department.\" The Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth. \"Effective rate.\" The tax rate applicable during the fiscal year or, if more than one rate is applicable, the average of the rates that were in effect for each month of the fiscal year. \"Fiscal year.\" A year beginning on July 1 and ending on the subsequent June 30. \"Gross receipts.\" The gross receipts from the retail sales of electric energy as defined in section 1101(b) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971. \"1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base.\" The receipts from affected taxes from the fiscal year 1995-1996, such amount being $984,141,837. \"Portion of the 1995-1996 fiscal tax revenue base attributable to the affected tax.\" The following amounts for the tax indicated: Tax Amount Corporate net income tax $181,628,433 Capital stock-franchise tax $117,495,605 Sales and use tax $187,401,632 Public utility realty tax $ 43,883,573 Utilities gross receipts tax $453,732,594 \"Total utilities gross receipts.\" The total gross receipts for a calendar year for all electric distribution companies and electric generation suppliers which are derived from the sales of electric energy and required to be reported to the commission under subsection (c)(6)(iii).

(b) Initiation of investigations.-- Upon complaint or upon its own motion for good cause shown, the commission shall conduct an investigation of the impact on the proper functioning of a fully competitive retail electricity market, including the effect of mergers, consolidations, acquisition or disposition of assets or securities of electricity suppliers, transmission congestion and anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct affecting the retail distribution of electricity. (c) Conduct of investigations.-- (1) The commission may require an electricity supplier to provide information, including documents and testimony, in accordance with the commission's regulations regarding the discovery of information from any electricity supplier. (2) Confidential, proprietary or trade secret information provided under this subsection shall not be disclosed to any person not directly employed or retained by the commission to conduct the investigation without the consent of the party providing the information. (3) Notwithstanding the prohibition on disclosure of information in paragraph (2), the commission shall disclose information obtained under this subsection to the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate under an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The commission may disclose the information to appropriate Federal or State law enforcement officials if it determines that the disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent or restrain a violation of Federal or State law and it provides the party that provided the information with reasonable notice and opportunity to prevent or limit disclosure. (d) Referrals and intervention.-- If, as a result of an investigation conducted under this section, the commission has reason to believe that anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, is preventing the retail electricity customers in this Commonwealth from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market, the commission, pursuant to its regulations, shall: (1) Refer its findings to the Attorney General, the United States Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. (2) Subject to subsection (c)(3), disclose any information it has obtained in the course of its investigation to the agency or agencies to which it has made a referral under paragraph (1).

(e) Approval of proposed mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or dispositions.-- (1) In the exercise of authority the commission otherwise may have to approve the mergers or consolidations by electric utilities or electricity suppliers, or the acquisition or disposition of assets or securities of other public utilities or electricity suppliers, the commission shall consider whether the proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition is likely to result in anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, which will prevent retail electricity customers in this Commonwealth from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market. (2) Upon request for approval, the commission shall provide notice and an opportunity for open, public evidentiary hearings. If the commission finds, after hearing, that a proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition is likely to result in anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, which will prevent retail electricity customers in this Commonwealth from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market, the commission shall not approve such proposed merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition, except upon such terms and conditions as it finds necessary to preserve the benefits of a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market.

(ii) Following public hearing on the matter and a finding of public interest, may direct the electric distribution company to take any and all reasonable legal action, including the filing of a lawsuit as may be necessary, to recover the quantified damages which shall be used to recompense Pennsylvania ratepayers affected by the market misconduct. (2) If the electric distribution company fails to pursue reasonable action to quantify or seek recovery of damages for Pennsylvania ratepayers affected by market manipulation, the exercise of market power or collusion, the commission is authorized, following notice and an opportunity of the electric distribution company to comply or contest, to assess a civil penalty, which shall not be recovered in rates, of not more than $10,000 per day for failure or neglect to obey an order of the commission, the continuance of the failure or neglect being a separate offense. (3) Any monetary damages recovered by the electric distribution company shall be paid to affected Pennsylvania ratepayers in the form of a credit to their electric bills or as refunds. (4) The provisions of this subsection shall be held to be in addition to and not in substitution for or limitation of any other provision of this title.

(c) Bona fide retail request program.-- A local exchange telecommunications company that elects to amend its network modernization plan pursuant to subsection (b)(2) or (3) shall no later than 90 days after the effective date of its amended plan implement a bona fide retail request program in areas where it does not provide broadband. Not later than 30 days in advance of program implementation, the local exchange telecommunications company shall file with the commission and provide the department with a written description of the program, a sample request for advanced services form for use in the program and the form of any advanced services term subscription agreements customers will be required to execute in connection with receiving the requested services. A bona fide retail request program shall consist of the following: (1) Any person, business, local development district, industrial development agency or other entity seeking advanced services pursuant to a bona fide retail request program shall submit a written request for such services to the local exchange telecommunications company or to the department in accordance with subsection (d). The written request may be in the form of a petition which includes the information required by paragraph (2), in the form provided by the department under subsection (d) which includes the information required by paragraph (2) or in the form of individual requests each of which includes the information required by paragraph (2). If individual requests are received, the local exchange telecommunications company shall aggregate requests for the same service and initiate appropriate action pursuant to this subsection when the required number of requests have been received. (2) To be considered a bona fide retail request, the written request must include: (i) a request that a minimum of 50 retail access lines or 25% of retail access lines within a community, whichever is less, each be provided the same advanced service or comparable advanced services having a bandwidth within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of each other. Notwithstanding the foregoing comparable bandwidth limitation, where a request includes individual customer requests for advanced services having equal to or less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) bandwidth in the downstream direction, all lines in the request shall be counted in meeting the minimum line requirement of this subparagraph; (ii) the name, address, telephone number and signature of each existing retail customer requesting the advanced service, the advanced service being requested and the number of access lines for which the advanced service is being requested; (iii) the name, address and telephone number of a designated contact person where the request is made by or on behalf of more than one person or business; and (iv) a commitment by each customer who signs the request to subscribe to the requested service for one year, subject to the local exchange telecommunications company's identification of the price and terms of the service and the customer's agreement to the price and terms. (3) In administering the bona fide retail request program, the local exchange telecommunications company shall: (i) establish an Internet website and toll-free telephone number to address customer inquiries regarding the program; (ii) mail a request form to a customer upon request; (iii) confirm its receipt of any completed request in writing to the customer and identify the service requested; (iv) as part of the written confirmation, if available, or in a subsequent written communication to the customer, provide the customer the applicable rate, the contract term, the status of the request and a term subscription agreement for execution; and (v) notify the customers in a community, within 30 days of receipt of a bona fide request, of the expected date of the availability of the requesters' service. (4) When a bona fide retail request has been received that meets the requirements of paragraph (2), the local exchange telecommunications company shall provide the requested advanced service, or other reasonably comparable service having a bandwidth within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of the requested service, to the community as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 365 days of the date the requirements of paragraph (2) have been met or within the period approved by the commission under paragraph (5) or (6) where: (i) the local exchange telecommunications company provides the requested advanced service to other customers in its service territory; (ii) no service is available to the requesting customers from an alternative service provider at or within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of the data speed requested or such service is available at a price that exceeds the then current price offered by the local exchange telecommunications company by more than 50%; (iii) the community is situated within the service territory of the local exchange telecommunications company; and (iv) the local exchange telecommunications company does not have to provide fiber to the customer's premises to furnish the requested advanced service. (5) Where, as a result of property acquisition, including acquiring rights-of-way, or new construction, a local exchange telecommunications company is unable to provide the requested advanced service within the one-year period set forth in paragraph (4), the company may petition the commission for an extension of up to six months, with service upon the customer or customers who made the bona fide retail request and the department if the department submitted the request on behalf of the customer or customers. The commission may delegate its authority to rule on such petitions to a bureau director or other appropriate employee who shall grant the petition for good cause shown. (6) Where the total number of bona fide retail requests received by any local exchange telecommunications company or affiliated companies that meet the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4) exceed 40 requests in any 12-month period or where there are more than 20 such requests that require property acquisition, including acquiring rights-of-way, or new construction in any 12-month period, the local exchange telecommunications company or companies may provide a verified certification to the commission that one or both of the previously stated criteria are met, with service upon the customer or customers who made the additional requests and upon the department if the department submitted any such requests. Upon receipt of the certification, the commission or the commission through its designated staff shall permit the local exchange telecommunications company or companies to extend the time for such deployments for a period of no more than 12 months unless the commission determines an additional time period to be just and reasonable. If a deployment is extended, it shall be counted in determining the maximum number of deployments provided for under this subsection in any 12-month period covering the month to which it is extended. (7) No advanced service requested and deployed by a local exchange telecommunications company under the bona fide retail request program which has a bandwidth of less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) in the downstream direction shall be counted as a credit toward the local exchange telecommunications company's broadband deployment obligation under its network modernization plan amended pursuant to subsection (b)(2) or (3). (8) With regard to requests submitted under this subsection, a retail customer may challenge the action of a local exchange telecommunications company pursuant to section 701 (relating to complaints). (9) Local exchange telecommunications companies with bona fide retail request programs shall provide semiannual reports to the commission and the department of the number of requests for advanced services received during the reporting period by exchange or density cell and the action taken on requests meeting the requirements of this subsection. (10) A local exchange telecommunication company's bona fide retail request program established under this subsection shall continue through December 31, 2015, or such earlier date as the local exchange telecommunications company achieves 100% broadband availability throughout its service territory. (11) In addition to adjudicating any complaints brought by customers under paragraph (8), the commission shall monitor and enforce the compliance of participating local exchange telecommunications companies with their obligations under this subsection. (d) Business attraction or retention program.-- (1) Not later than 90 days after amending its network modernization plan under subsection (b)(2) or (3), the local exchange telecommunications company shall establish a business attraction or retention program to permit the department to aggregate customer demand where necessary and facilitate the deployment of advanced or broadband services to qualifying businesses which the department seeks to attract to or retain in this Commonwealth and whose requests for such services are submitted by or through the department. (2) Each local exchange telecommunications company which amends its network modernization plan under subsection (b)(2) or (3) not later than 90 days after the effective date of its amended plan shall designate a single point of contact to receive all written advanced or broadband service requests forwarded by the department, provide associated contact information to the department and provide the department and the commission with a written description of its participation in the program and a sample request for advanced or broadband services form for use in the program. (3) The department may submit a request to the applicable local exchange telecommunications company by or on behalf of qualifying businesses in areas that the department deems priority areas for economic development, including and giving preference to keystone opportunity zones, keystone opportunity expansion zones, enterprise zones, keystone opportunity improvement zones and other areas identified by the department as lacking adequate access to advanced or broadband services which would be important in order to promote economic development projects in those areas. (4) The department shall establish an advisory committee that shall consist of representatives of each local exchange telecommunications company with a business attraction or retention program, local development districts and other local economic and industrial development agencies to assist the department in developing protocols and procedures for implementing these programs pursuant to this subsection. (5) Qualifying business or businesses' requests for advanced services submitted by the department that are provisioned through the bona fide retail request program shall be processed in accordance with subsection (c) and shall be allocated 50% of the maximum number of annual deployments referenced in subsection (c)(6). Other requests shall be allocated 50% of the number of such deployments, provided, however, that any allocated deployments that are unused may be utilized by the department or nondepartment applicants, as applicable. (6) For qualifying business or businesses whose request for advanced services is determined by the local exchange telecommunications company to be better processed outside of the bona fide retail request program, the local exchange telecommunications company shall make a proposal to the requesting business or businesses to provide the requested advanced or broadband service and subsequently shall provision such service. The local exchange telecommunications company shall advise the department and the business or businesses within 30 days of the date the contract is signed of the date by which the requested advanced or broadband service will be provided, which date shall be not later than one year after the date the contract is signed unless the business or businesses agree to a longer period or the local exchange telecommunications company obtains commission approval of an extension under the same procedure set forth in subsection (c)(5). (7) No advanced service requested of and deployed by a local exchange telecommunications company under the Business Attraction or Retention Program which has a bandwidth of less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) in the downstream direction shall be counted as a credit toward the local exchange telecommunication company's broadband deployment obligation under its network modernization plan amended under subsection (b)(2) or (3). (8) Each local exchange telecommunications company which is required to participate in the department's Business Attraction or Retention Program shall continue its participation through December 31, 2015, or such earlier date as it achieves 100% broadband availability throughout its service territory. (9) The department shall oversee local exchange telecommunications company participation in the Business Attraction or Retention Program, including the timely completion of qualifying advanced or broadband services requests submitted by or through the department which are processed within or outside of the participating local exchange telecommunications companies' bona fide retail request programs. (10) The commission shall monitor and enforce the compliance of participating local exchange telecommunications companies with their obligations under the Business Attraction or Retention Program.

(2) Utilizing network modernization plan reports filed with the commission by local exchange telecommunications companies under section 3014(f), the commission shall monitor and enforce companies' compliance with their interim and final 100% commitments for broadband availability in their amended network modernization plans. In the event that a local exchange telecommunications company is found by the commission, after notice and evidentiary hearings held on an expedited basis, to have failed to meet such an interim or final 100% commitment, then the commission shall require the local exchange telecommunications company to refund to customers in its next price stability filing an amount that is just and reasonable under the circumstances. Such amount shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the percentage shortfall of the broadband availability commitment on an access-line basis required to be met during the period from the start of the amended plan or from the date of the last prior interim commitment, as applicable, times the increased revenue that was obtained during this period as a result of the modified inflation offset provided in this section that reduced the inflation offset applicable in the local exchange telecommunications company's alternative regulation plan in effect on the effective date of this section, plus interest calculated under section 1308(d) (relating to voluntary changes in rates). Any such refund required under this subsection shall be separate from and in addition to any civil or other penalties that the commission may impose on a local exchange telecommunications company under Chapter 33 (relating to violations and penalties). (3) Where annual rate adjustments made under a nonrural telecommunications carrier's price stability mechanism are calculated using revenues from protected services, an average rate adjustment for protected residential customer local exchange telecommunications service lines shall be determined by dividing the total protected service revenues associated with such lines, as adjusted by the price stability formula, by the number of such lines, and the rate adjustment for any individual line shall not vary from this average rate adjustment by more than 20%. (b) Rate changes for rural telecommunications carriers.-- (1) In addition to the rate change provisions in its alternative form of regulation plan, a rural telecommunications carrier operating without a price stability mechanism that files with the commission an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(1) or (2) shall be permitted at any time to file proposed tariff changes with the commission, effective 45 days after filing, setting forth miscellaneous changes, including increases and decreases, in rates for noncompetitive services, excluding basic residential and business rates, provided such rate changes do not increase the rural telecommunications carrier's annual intrastate revenues by more than 3%. (2) The commission tariff filing requirements and review associated with such proposed rate changes shall be limited to schedules submitted by the rural telecommunications carrier detailing the impact of the rate changes on the carrier's annual intrastate revenues. (3) A rural telecommunications carrier that implements noncompetitive rate changes consistent with the procedure set forth in its alternative form of regulation plan shall be required only to file such financial and cost data with the commission to justify such changes as is required under its commission-approved alternative form of regulation plan. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), (2) or (3), for any rural telecommunications carrier serving less than 50,000 access lines in this Commonwealth and operating under an alternative form of regulation plan, a formal complaint to deny rate changes for noncompetitive services unless signed by at least 20 customers of the rural telecommunications carrier shall not prevent implementation of the rate changes pending the adjudication of the formal complaint by the commission. (c) Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund.-- (1) There is hereby established within the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund for the purposes enumerated in section 3014(i). (2) A local exchange telecommunications company that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(2) or (3) shall be assessed by the commission for contribution to the fund and to the E-fund established under subsection (d) an amount of 20% of the first year's annual revenue effect: (i) of any rate increase permitted by the elimination or reduction of the offset under subsection (a) and placed into effect; or (ii) of any rate increase placed into effect under subsection (b)(1) if the local exchange telecommunications company is operating without a price stability mechanism. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"first year's annual revenue effect\" means the projected or actual increased revenues received by the local exchange telecommunications company during the one-year period from the effective date of its rate increase. The commission shall begin the assessments provided for in this paragraph on June 30, 2005, and thereafter shall make such assessments annually on June 30 until June 30, 2010, for assessments that include amounts for the fund and the e-fund and until June 30, 2015, for assessments that include amounts for only the fund. Each assessment shall be based on the first year's annual revenue effect of any covered rate increase effective after the date of the last annual assessment. (3) An amount not to exceed 50% of such assessment shall be allocated to the fund. The remainder of the assessment shall be allocated to the E-fund provided for under subsection (d) until its termination on June 30, 2011. After the E-fund termination, the maximum assessment percentage shall be reduced from 20% to 10%, and contributions shall be made only to the fund until the local exchange telecommunications company achieves 100% broadband availability. Contributions of allocated amounts shall be paid to the fund and the E-fund by the local exchange telecommunications company in equal quarterly installments. (4) In no event shall the total amount of the fund exceed $5,000,000 annually, and in the event of such overfunding the department shall credit the overcollection to the next year's contribution amount. (5) A local exchange telecommunications company that elects to amend its network modernization plan pursuant to section 3014 (b)(1) shall not be required to contribute to the fund. (6) The moneys in the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund are hereby appropriated upon approval of the Governor to the department for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (1). The department may use up to 3% of the money in the fund for administration. (7) The fund shall continue until July 1, 2016, at which time the fund shall terminate, and the department shall return any funds remaining in the fund on a pro rata basis to the local exchange telecommunications companies that contributed to the fund. (d) Education Technology Fund (E-Fund).-- (1) There is hereby established within the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Education Technology Fund (E-Fund) for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (4). (2) All E-fund assessments imposed by the commission under subsection (c)(2) and paragraph (3), moneys specifically appropriated by the General Assembly for the purposes of this subsection and any funds, contributions or payments which may be made available to the fund by the Federal Government, another State agency or any public or private source for the purpose of implementing this subsection shall be deposited in the E-Fund. (3) Beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, the commission shall, no later than June 30, annually assess each nonrural telecommunications carrier that files an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3) an amount to be deposited in the E-Fund. Each carrier's annual assessment shall be payable in two equal installments due on October 31 of each year and January 31 of the following year and shall be based on the relative proportion of the retail access lines served by the nonrural telecommunications carrier in relation to the number of retail access lines served by all nonrural telecommunications carriers that have filed an amended network modernization plan under section 3014(b)(3). For fiscal years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, the total annual assessment amount shall be $7,000,000. For fiscal years 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, the total annual assessment amount shall be the difference between $7,000,000 and any amount remaining in the E-Fund from prior fiscal years which remains unencumbered or unexpended. A nonrural telecommunications carrier's assessments required under this paragraph may not be recovered via a surcharge on customers' bills or in rates for noncompetitive services as exogenous change adjustment under the provisions of the carrier's price stability mechanism and subsection (a)(3) where applicable. (4) Additional local exchange telecommunications company contributions to the E-fund shall be made pursuant to the provisions of subsections (c)(2) and (3). (5) The Department of Education shall expend the moneys of the E-Fund for the purpose of providing grants to school entities as prescribed by section 3014(j). (6) The moneys of the Education Technology Fund are hereby appropriated upon approval of the Governor to the Department of Education for the purposes enumerated in paragraph (5). The Department of Education may use up to 3% of the money for administration. Appropriations by the General Assembly to the fund shall be continuing appropriations and shall not lapse at the close of any fiscal year. (7) The E-Fund shall continue until June 30, 2011, at which time the fund shall terminate and the Department of Education shall return any funds remaining therein on a pro rata basis to the local exchange telecommunications companies that contributed to the fund. (e) General filing requirements.-- The commission's filing and audit requirements for a local exchange telecommunications company that is operating under an amended network modernization plan shall be limited to the following: (1) Network modernization plan reports filed pursuant to section 3014(f). (2) An annual financial report consisting of a balance sheet and income statement. (3) An annual deaf, speech-impaired and hearing-impaired relay information report. (4) An annual service report. (5) Universal service reports. (6) An annual access line report. (7) An annual statement of gross intrastate operating revenues for purposes of calculating assessments for regulatory expenses. (8) An annual State tax adjustment computation for years in which a tax change has occurred, if applicable. (9) For those companies with a bona fide retail request program, a bona fide retail request report under section 3014(c)(9). These reports shall be submitted in the form determined by the commission. (f) Other reports.-- (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title to the contrary, no report, statement, filing or other document or information, except as specified in subsection (e), shall be required of any local exchange telecommunications company unless the commission, upon notice to the affected local exchange telecommunications company and an opportunity to be heard, has first made specific written findings supporting conclusions in an entered order that: (i) The report is necessary to ensure that the local exchange telecommunications company is charging rates that are in compliance with this chapter and its effective alternative form of regulation. (ii) The benefits of the report substantially outweigh the attendant expense and administrative time and effort required of the local exchange telecommunications company to prepare it. (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impede the ability of the commission to require the submission of further information to support the accuracy of or to seek an explanation of the reports specified in subsection (e). (g) Rate change limitations.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the requirement of section 1301 (relating to rates to be just and reasonable) that rates shall be just and reasonable. The annual rate change limitations set forth in a local exchange telecommunications company's effective commission-approved alternative form of regulation plan or any other commission-approved annual rate change limitation shall remain applicable and shall be deemed just and reasonable under section 1301. (h) Conformance of plan.-- Upon approval of a local exchange telecommunications company of network modernization plan amendments pursuant to section 3014(e), the local exchange telecommunications company's alternative form of regulation plan shall be deemed amended consistent with this section.

(a) Commission determination of protected, retail nonprotected and retail noncompetitive services as competitive.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company may petition the commission for a determination of whether a protected or retail noncompetitive service or other business activity in its service territory or a particular geographic area, exchange or group of exchanges or density cell within its service territory is competitive based on the demonstrated availability of like or substitute services or other business activities provided or offered by alternative service providers. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall enter an order granting or denying the petition within 60 days of the filing date or within 150 days of the filing date where a protest is timely filed, or the petition shall be deemed granted. (2) The local exchange telecommunications company shall serve a copy of its petition on the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission. (3) In making its determination, the commission shall consider all relevant information submitted to it, including the availability of like or substitute services or other business activities, and shall limit its determination to the service territory or the particular geographic area, exchange or group of exchanges or density cell in which the service or other business activity has been proved to be competitive. (4) The burden of proving that a protected or retail noncompetitive service or other business activity is competitive rests on the local exchange telecommunications company. (b) Declaration of retail nonprotected services as competitive.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), a local exchange telecommunications company may declare any retail nonprotected service as competitive by filing its declaration with the commission and serving it on the Office of Consumer Advocate, Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission, provided that a local exchange telecommunications company may not use this declaration process for any service that the commission previously has reclassified as noncompetitive under either subsection (c) or prior law. A declaration of a retail nonprotected service as competitive shall be effective upon filing by the local exchange telecommunications company with the commission. (c) Reclassification.-- (1) A party may petition the commission for a determination of whether a service or other business activity previously determined or declared to be competitive is noncompetitive. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall enter an order deciding the petition within 60 days of the filing date or 90 days of the filing date where a protest is timely filed, or the petition shall be approved. (2) The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition on the affected local exchange telecommunications company if the petitioner is not the company, the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate and each of the parties to the commission's proceeding in which the company's network modernization plan that was in effect on December 31, 2003, was approved by the commission. (3) In making its determination, the commission shall consider all relevant information submitted to it, including the availability of like or substitute services or other business activities, and shall limit its determination to the particular geographic area, exchange or density cell in which the service or other business activity has been proved to be noncompetitive. (4) The burden of proving that a competitive service or other business activity should be reclassified as noncompetitive rests on the party seeking the reclassification. (5) If the commission reclassifies a service or other business activity as noncompetitive, the commission shall determine a just and reasonable rate for the reclassified service or business activity in accordance with section 1301 (relating to rates to be just and reasonable). (d) Additional requirements.-- (1) The prices which a local exchange telecommunications company charges for competitive services shall not be less than the costs to provide the services. (2) The commission may not require tariffs for competitive service offerings to be filed with the commission. (3) A local exchange telecommunications company at its option may tariff its rates subject to rules and regulations applicable to the provision of competitive services. (4) The commission may require a local exchange telecommunications company to maintain price lists with the commission applicable to its competitive services. Price changes that are filed in a company's tariff for competitive services will go into effect on a one-day notice. (e) Pricing flexibility and bundling.-- (1) Subject to the requirements of subsection (d)(1), a local exchange telecommunications company may price competitive services at the company's discretion. (2) A local exchange telecommunications company may offer and bill to customers on one bill bundled packages of services which include nontariffed, competitive, noncompetitive or protected services, including services of an affiliate, in combinations and at a single price selected by the company. A local exchange telecommunications company may file an informational tariff for a bundled package effective on a one-day notice. (3) When an alternative service provider is offering local exchange telecommunications services within an exchange of a rural telecommunications carrier, the rural telecommunications carrier may reduce its prices on services offered within the exchange below the rates set forth in its otherwise applicable tariff in order to meet such competition. A rural telecommunications carrier may not offset revenue reductions resulting from such competitive pricing by increasing rates charged to other customers through its price stability mechanism or otherwise. (f) Prohibitions.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company shall be prohibited from using revenues earned or expenses incurred in conjunction with noncompetitive services to subsidize competitive services. (2) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prevent the marketing and billing of packages containing both noncompetitive and competitive services to customers.

(b) Limitation on termination of leasehold interest.-- After the declaration for a leasehold condominium is recorded, neither the lessor nor his successor in interest may terminate the leasehold interest of a unit owner who makes timely payment of his share of the rent and otherwise complies with all covenants which, if violated, would entitle the lessor to terminate the lease. A unit owner's leasehold interest is not affected by failure of any other person to pay rent or fulfill any other covenant. (c) Merger of leasehold and fee simple interests.-- Acquisition of the leasehold interest of any unit owner by the owner of the reversion or remainder does not merge the leasehold and fee simple interests unless the leasehold interests of all unit owners subject to that reversion or remainder are acquired.

(a) General rule.-- In addition to the requirements of subsection (c.1), a well operator who affects a public or private water supply by pollution or diminution shall restore or replace the affected supply with an alternate source of water adequate in quantity or quality for the purposes served by the supply. The department shall ensure that the quality of a restored or replaced water supply meets the standards established under the act of May 1, 1984 (P.L.206, No.43), known as the Pennsylvania Safe Drinking Water Act, or is comparable to the quality of the water supply before it was affected by the operator if that water supply exceeded those standards. The Environmental Quality Board shall promulgate regulations necessary to meet the requirements of this subsection. (b) Pollution or diminution of water supply.-- A landowner or water purveyor suffering pollution or diminution of a water supply as a result of the drilling, alteration or operation of an oil or gas well may so notify the department and request that an investigation be conducted. Within ten days of notification, the department shall investigate the claim and make a determination within 45 days following notification. If the department finds that the pollution or diminution was caused by drilling, alteration or operation activities or if it presumes the well operator responsible for pollution under subsection (c), the department shall issue orders to the well operator necessary to assure compliance with subsection (a), including orders requiring temporary replacement of a water supply where it is determined that pollution or diminution may be of limited duration. (b.1) (Reserved). (b.2) Telephone number.-- The department shall establish a single Statewide toll-free telephone number that persons may use to report cases of water contamination which may be associated with the development of oil and gas resources. The Statewide toll-free telephone number shall be provided in a conspicuous manner in the notification required under section 3211(b) (relating to well permits) and on the department's Internet website. (b.3) Responses.-- The department shall develop appropriate administrative responses to calls received on the Statewide toll-free telephone number for water contamination. (b.4) Website.-- The department shall publish, on its Internet website, lists of confirmed cases of subterranean water supply contamination that result from hydraulic fracturing. (b.5) Facility operation qualifications.-- The department shall ensure that a facility which seeks a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the purposes of treating and discharging wastewater originating from oil and gas activities into waters of this Commonwealth is operated by a competent and qualified individual. (c) Presumption.-- Unless rebutted by a defense established in subsection (d), it shall be presumed that a well operator is responsible for pollution of a water supply if: (1) except as set forth in paragraph (2): (i) the water supply is within 1,000 feet of an oil or gas well; and (ii) the pollution occurred within six months after completion of drilling or alteration of the oil or gas well; or (2) in the case of an unconventional well: (i) the water supply is within 2,500 feet of the unconventional vertical well bore; and (ii) the pollution occurred within 12 months of the later of completion, drilling, stimulation or alteration of the unconventional well. (c.1) Requirement.-- If the affected water supply is within the rebuttable presumption area as provided in subsection (c) and the rebuttable presumption applies, the operator shall provide a temporary water supply if the water user is without a readily available alternative source of water. The temporary water supply provided under this subsection shall be adequate in quantity and quality for the purposes served by the supply. (d) Defenses.-- To rebut the presumption established under subsection (c), a well operator must affirmatively prove any of the following: (1) except as set forth in paragraph (2): (i) the pollution existed prior to the drilling or alteration activity as determined by a predrilling or prealteration survey; (ii) the landowner or water purveyor refused to allow the operator access to conduct a predrilling or prealteration survey; (iii) the water supply is not within 1,000 feet of the well; (iv) the pollution occurred more than six months after completion of drilling or alteration activities; and (v) the pollution occurred as the result of a cause other than the drilling or alteration activity; or (2) in the case of an unconventional well: (i) the pollution existed prior to the drilling, stimulation or alteration activity as determined by a predrilling or prealteration survey; (ii) the landowner or water purveyor refused to allow the operator access to conduct a predrilling or prealteration survey; (iii) the water supply is not within 2,500 feet of the unconventional vertical well bore; (iv) the pollution occurred more than 12 months after completion of drilling or alteration activities; or (v) the pollution occurred as the result of a cause other than the drilling or alteration activity. (e) Independent certified laboratory.-- An operator electing to preserve a defense under subsection (d)(1) or (2) shall retain an independent certified laboratory to conduct a predrilling or prealteration survey of the water supply. A copy of survey results shall be submitted to the department and the landowner or water purveyor in the manner prescribed by the department. (e.1) Notice.-- An operator of an unconventional well must provide written notice to the landowner or water purveyor indicating that the presumption established under subsection (c) may be void if the landowner or water purveyor refused to allow the operator access to conduct a predrilling or prealteration survey. Proof of written notice to the landowner or water purveyor shall be provided to the department for the operator to retain the protections under subsection (d)(2)(ii). Proof of written notice shall be presumed if provided in accordance with section 3212(a) (relating to permit objections). (f) Other remedies preserved.-- Nothing in this section shall prevent a landowner or water purveyor claiming pollution or diminution of a water supply from seeking any other remedy at law or in equity.

(a) Number of votes required.-- Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain (section 3107), a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (b) Execution and recording agreement and ratifications.-- An agreement of unit owners to terminate a condominium must be evidenced by their execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners who are owners of record as of the date preceding the date of recordation of the termination agreement. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. The termination agreement will become null and void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of: (1) The expiration of one year from the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. (2) Such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. If, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the terms of the sale. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the condominium in both the grantor index and the grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recordation. (c) Status if real estate sold.-- The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). If the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (f). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this subpart or the declaration. (d) Status if real estate not sold.-- If the real estate constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to the real estate, upon termination, vests in the unit owners as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (f) and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. (e) Distribution of assets of association.-- Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, shall be held by the association as trustee or unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units which were recorded, filed of public record or otherwise perfected before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination. (f) Respective interests of unit owners.-- The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (c), (d) and (e) are as follows: (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements and common element interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements. (2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof prior to destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination. (g) Effect of foreclosure or enforcement of lien.-- Except as provided in subsection (h), foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the condominium. (h) Exclusion from condominium upon foreclosure.-- If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over the declaration and if the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium. (i) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.-- In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the condominium other than a provision providing for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the condominium would otherwise be terminated owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the condominium are allocated vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.

(a) Acquisition of services.-- (1) A person is guilty of theft if he intentionally obtains services for himself or for another which he knows are available only for compensation, by deception or threat, by altering or tampering with the public utility meter or measuring device by which such services are delivered or by causing or permitting such altering or tampering, by making or maintaining any unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically or inductively, to a distribution or transmission line, by attaching or maintaining the attachment of any unauthorized device to any cable, wire or other component of an electric, telephone or cable television system or to a television receiving set connected to a cable television system, by making or maintaining any unauthorized modification or alteration to any device installed by a cable television system, or by false token or other trick or artifice to avoid payment for the service. (1.1) A person is guilty of theft if he intentionally obtains or attempts to obtain telecommunication service by the use of an unlawful telecommunication device or without the consent of the telecommunication service provider. (2) (Deleted by amendment). (3) A person is not guilty of theft of cable television service under this section who subscribes to and receives service through an authorized connection of a television receiving set at his dwelling and, within his dwelling, makes an unauthorized connection of an additional television receiving set or sets or audio system which receives only basic cable television service obtained through such authorized connection. (4) Where compensation for service is ordinarily paid immediately upon the rendering of such service, as in the case of hotels and restaurants, refusal to pay or absconding without payment or offer to pay gives rise to a presumption that the service was obtained by deception as to intention to pay. (b) Diversion of services.-- A person is guilty of theft if, having control over the disposition of services of others to which he is not entitled, he knowingly diverts such services to his own benefit or to the benefit of another not entitled thereto. (c) Grading.-- (1) An offense under this section constitutes a summary offense when the value of the services obtained or diverted is less than $50. (2) When the value of the services obtained or diverted is $50 or more, the grading of the offense shall be as established in section 3903 (relating to grading of theft offenses). (3) Amounts involved in theft of services committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same person or several persons, may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense. (d) Inferences.-- (1) Any person having possession of or access to the location of a public utility meter or service measuring device which has been avoided or tampered with so as to inhibit or prevent the accurate measurement of utility service and who enjoys the use of or receives the benefit from the public utility service intended to be metered or measured by the public utility meter or measuring device so avoided or tampered with may be reasonably inferred to have acted to avoid or tamper with the public utility meter or measuring device with the intent to obtain the public utility service without making full compensation therefor. (2) Any person having possession of or access to the location of the distribution or transmission lines or other facilities of a cable television system which have been tapped, altered or tampered with or to which any unauthorized connection has been made or to which any unauthorized device has been attached or any person having possession of or access to any device installed by a cable television system to which an unauthorized modification or alteration has been made, the result of which tapping, altering, tampering, connection, attachment or modification is to avoid payment for all or any part of the cable television service for which payment is normally required, and who enjoys the use of or receives the benefit from the cable television service, may be reasonably inferred to have acted to have tapped, altered, tampered with, connected or attached to or modified cable television facilities with the intent to obtain cable television service without making full compensation therefor. This inference shall not apply to the act of a subscriber to cable television service, who receives service through an authorized connection of a television receiving set at his dwelling, in making, within his dwelling, an unauthorized connection of an additional television receiving set or sets or audio system which receives only basic cable television service obtained through such authorized connection. (e) Sale or transfer of device or plan intended for acquisition or diversion.-- A person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree if he sells, gives or otherwise transfers to others or offers, advertises or exposes for sale to others, any device, kit, plan or other instructional procedure for the making of such device or a printed circuit, under circumstances indicating his having knowledge or reason to believe that such device, kit, plan or instructional procedure is intended for use by such others for the acquisition or diversion of services as set forth in subsections (a) and (b). (f) Restitution.-- The court may, in addition to any other sentence authorized by law, sentence a person convicted of violating this section to make restitution under section 1106 (relating to restitution for injuries to person or property) or 42 Pa.C.S. § 9721(c) (relating to sentencing generally). (g) Civil action.-- A telecommunication service provider aggrieved by a violation of this section may in a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction obtain appropriate relief, including preliminary and other equitable or declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, reasonable investigation expenses, costs of suit and attorney fees. (h) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Service.\" Includes, but is not limited to, labor, professional service, transportation service, the supplying of hotel accommodations, restaurant services, entertainment, cable television service, the supplying of equipment for use and the supplying of commodities of a public utility nature such as gas, electricity, steam and water, and telephone or telecommunication service. The term \"unauthorized\" means that payment of full compensation for service has been avoided, or has been sought to be avoided, without the consent of the supplier of the service. \"Telecommunication service provider.\" A person or entity providing telecommunication service, including, but not limited to, a cellular, paging or other wireless communications company or other person or entity which, for a fee, supplies the facility, cell site, mobile telephone switching office or other equipment or telecommunication service. \"Telephone service\" or \"telecommunication service.\" Includes, but is not limited to, any service provided for a charge or compensation to facilitate the origination, transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, data, writings, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by telephone, including cellular telephones, wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photo-optical system. \"Unlawful telecommunication device.\" Any electronic serial number, mobile identification number, personal identification number or any telecommunication device that is capable or has been altered, modified, programmed or reprogrammed alone or in conjunction with another access device or other equipment so as to be capable of acquiring or facilitating the acquisition of a telecommunication service without the consent of the telecommunication service provider. The term includes, but is not limited to, phones altered to obtain service without the consent of the telecommunication service provider, tumbler phones, counterfeit or clone phones, tumbler microchips, counterfeit or clone microchips, scanning receivers of wireless telecommunication service of a telecommunication service provider and other instruments capable of disguising their identity or location or of gaining access to a communications system operated by a telecommunication service provider.

(a) Offense defined.-- A person is guilty of a retail theft if he: (1) takes possession of, carries away, transfers or causes to be carried away or transferred, any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale by any store or other retail mercantile establishment with the intention of depriving the merchant of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value thereof; (2) alters, transfers or removes any label, price tag marking, indicia of value or any other markings which aid in determining value affixed to any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a store or other retail mercantile establishment and attempts to purchase such merchandise personally or in consort with another at less than the full retail value with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such merchandise; (3) transfers any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale by any store or other retail mercantile establishment from the container in or on which the same shall be displayed to any other container with intent to deprive the merchant of all or some part of the full retail value thereof; or (4) under-rings with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of the merchandise. (5) destroys, removes, renders inoperative or deactivates any inventory control tag, security strip or any other mechanism designed or employed to prevent an offense under this section with the intention of depriving the merchant of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value thereof.

(ii) Misdemeanor of the second degree when the offense is a second offense and the value of the merchandise is less than $150. (iii) Misdemeanor of the first degree when the offense is a first or second offense and the value of the merchandise is $150 or more. (iv) Felony of the third degree when the offense is a third or subsequent offense, regardless of the value of the merchandise. (v) Felony of the third degree when the amount involved exceeds $1,000 or if the merchandise involved is a firearm or a motor vehicle. (1.1) Any person who is convicted under subsection (a) of retail theft of motor fuel may, in addition to any other penalty imposed, be sentenced as follows: (i) For a first offense, to pay a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $250.

(iii) For a third or subsequent offense, to pay a fine of not less than $500, or the court may order the operating privilege of the person suspended for 30 days. A copy of the order shall be transmitted to the Department of Transportation. (2) Amounts involved in retail thefts committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same store or retail mercantile establishment or several stores or retail mercantile establishments, may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense. (b.1) Calculation of prior offenses.-- For the purposes of this section, in determining whether an offense is a first, second, third or subsequent offense, the court shall include a conviction, acceptance of accelerated rehabilitative disposition or other form of preliminary disposition, occurring before the sentencing on the present violation, for an offense under this section, an offense substantially similar to an offense under this section or under the prior laws of this Commonwealth or a similar offense under the statutes of any other state or of the United States. (c) Presumptions.-- Any person intentionally concealing unpurchased property of any store or other mercantile establishment, either on the premises or outside the premises of such store, shall be prima facie presumed to have so concealed such property with the intention of depriving the merchant of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value thereof within the meaning of subsection (a), and the finding of such unpurchased property concealed, upon the person or among the belongings of such person, shall be prima facie evidence of intentional concealment, and, if such person conceals, or causes to be concealed, such unpurchased property, upon the person or among the belongings of another, such fact shall also be prima facie evidence of intentional concealment on the part of the person so concealing such property. (c.1) Evidence.-- To the extent that there is other competent evidence to substantiate the offense, the conviction shall not be avoided because the prosecution cannot produce the stolen merchandise. (d) Detention.-- A peace officer, merchant or merchant's employee or an agent under contract with a merchant, who has probable cause to believe that retail theft has occurred or is occurring on or about a store or other retail mercantile establishment and who has probable cause to believe that a specific person has committed or is committing the retail theft may detain the suspect in a reasonable manner for a reasonable time on or off the premises for all or any of the following purposes: to require the suspect to identify himself, to verify such identification, to determine whether such suspect has in his possession unpurchased merchandise taken from the mercantile establishment and, if so, to recover such merchandise, to inform a peace officer, or to institute criminal proceedings against the suspect. Such detention shall not impose civil or criminal liability upon the peace officer, merchant, employee, or agent so detaining. (e) Reduction prohibited.-- No magisterial district judge shall have the power to reduce any other charge of theft to a charge of retail theft as defined in this section. (f) Definitions.-- \"Conceal.\" To conceal merchandise so that, although there may be some notice of its presence, it is not visible through ordinary observation. \"Full retail value.\" The merchant's stated or advertised price of the merchandise. \"Merchandise.\" Any goods, chattels, foodstuffs or wares of any type and description, regardless of the value thereof. \"Merchant.\" An owner or operator of any retail mercantile establishment or any agent, employee, lessee, consignee, officer, director, franchisee or independent contractor of such owner or operator. \"Premises of a retail mercantile establishment.\" Includes but is not limited to, the retail mercantile establishment, any common use areas in shopping centers and all parking areas set aside by a merchant or on behalf of a merchant for the parking of vehicles for the convenience of the patrons of such retail mercantile establishment. \"Store or other retail mercantile establishment.\" A place where merchandise is displayed, held, stored or sold or offered to the public for sale. \"Under-ring.\" To cause the cash register or other sales recording device to reflect less than the full retail value of the merchandise. (g) Fingerprinting.-- Prior to the commencement of trial or entry of plea of a defendant 16 years of age or older accused of the summary offense of retail theft, the issuing authority shall order the defendant to submit within five days of such order for fingerprinting by the municipal police of the jurisdiction in which the offense allegedly was committed or the State Police. Fingerprints so obtained shall be forwarded immediately to the Pennsylvania State Police for determination as to whether or not the defendant previously has been convicted of the offense of retail theft. The results of such determination shall be forwarded to the Police Department obtaining the fingerprints if such department is the prosecutor, or to the issuing authority if the prosecutor is other than a police officer. The issuing authority shall not proceed with the trial or plea in summary cases until in receipt of the determination made by the State Police.

(b) Limitations on local regulation.-- The maximum size and weight of vehicles specified in this chapter shall govern throughout this Commonwealth and local authorities shall have no power or authority to alter these limitations except as express authority may be granted in this title. (c) Permit authorizing prohibited movement.-- If an overweight or oversize movement cannot be made in any other feasible manner, the permit may authorize the movement to be made in contravention to any provision of this title provided that: (1) the department or local authority determines that the movement is in the public interest; and (2) the movement is escorted by certified escort vehicles as defined under section 3108 (relating to drivers of certified escort vehicles) or the Pennsylvania State Police and the following shall apply: (i) The department, in consultation with the Pennsylvania State Police, shall determine whether a Pennsylvania State Police escort is necessary. (ii) If it is jointly determined by the Pennsylvania State Police and the department that the movement must be escorted by the Pennsylvania State Police, the permittee shall bear the total costs of escorting the movement. (d) Responsibility of local authorities.-- Local authorities: (1) that have adopted an ordinance under this chapter; or (2) that establish or enforce size or weight limitations which differ from those provided for in this chapter; have the burden and responsibility to properly administer, adhere to and enforce compliance with the requirements of this chapter and the regulations of the department. Failure of a local authority to properly administer, adhere to or enforce the substantive requirements of this chapter and the department's regulations shall subject the local authority to penalties set forth under section 4907 (relating to penalty for violation of chapter).

(a) Restrictions based on condition of highway or bridge.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge only when they determine by conducting an engineering and traffic study as provided for in department regulations that the highway or bridge may be damaged or destroyed unless use by vehicles is prohibited or the permissible size or weight of vehicles is reduced. (2) School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (2.1) Government-owned vehicles, vehicles of local government agency contractors providing material for maintenance and department contractors engaged in or providing material for construction or maintenance shall be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways, except bridges, imposed under this subsection in accordance with department regulations. The following types of documents shall constitute evidence that a vehicle is traveling to or from a site in accordance with this paragraph: (i) A bill of lading. (ii) A shipping order. (iii) A service order or other document that indicates the address of the site and purpose of the trip. (3) The department may issue a statement of policy, which shall take effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, adopting an appropriate methodology to provide letters of local determination that identify particular vehicles, routes or uses as local in nature. (4) The methodology under paragraph (3) may allow for exemptions from 67 Pa. Code Ch. 189 (relating to hauling in excess of posted weight limit) related to the at-risk industry of logging or other forest products experiencing a 20% decline in Statewide employment between March 2002 and March 2011, as determined by the Department of Labor and Industry. (5) The exemptions and related requirements under paragraph (4) may remain in existence only until December 31, 2028. Exemptions for local delivery or pickup may not include traffic going to or coming from a site at which minerals, natural gas or natural resources are developed, harvested or extracted, notwithstanding whether the site is located at a residence, a commercial site or on farmland. Delivery or pickup of logs or other forest products to or from permanent processing mills located on or reachable only through posted highways shall be considered local delivery or pickup. Delivery or pickup of coal to or from permanent coal reprocessing or preparation plants located on or reachable only through posted highways and not on the same posted highway as a site at which coal is extracted shall be considered local delivery or pickup. (b) Restrictions based on traffic conditions.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge whenever they determine that hazardous traffic conditions or other safety factors require such a prohibition or restriction. School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (c) Permits and security.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities may issue permits for movement of vehicles of size and weight in excess of restrictions promulgated under subsections (a) and (b) with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdiction and may require such agreement or security as they deem necessary to cover the cost of repairs and restoration necessitated by the permitted movement of vehicles. In reference to subsection (a), the Commonwealth and local authorities shall not refuse to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction if there is no reasonable alternate route available. For purposes of this section, \"reasonable alternate route\" shall mean a route meeting the criteria set forth in department regulations relating to traffic and engineering studies. (2) The department may establish the types of permits to be issued and agreements to be entered into, subject to the following: (i) Permits may be for long-term or short-term use of the posted highways. (ii) The department may require multiple vehicles traveling to or from a single destination to operate pursuant to a single permit. (iii) The department may establish a permit type allowing the posting authority to determine that damage to the posted highway covered by the permit will be minimal. This type of permit may include categories based on the number and kinds of loads expected, including a category providing that use of the posted highway under a single minimum-use permit of less than 700 loads per year shall not require an agreement or security. The department may alter the 700 loads per year minimum-use threshold if it determines the structural capacity of the State highways can accept a higher or lower amount of over-posted weight traffic. The department may express the threshold as a loads-per-day, loads-per-week or loads-per-month number. (iv) The department may restrict use of de minimis and minimum-use permits during thaw periods as determined by the department. (v) The department shall exclude hauling related to unconventional oil and gas development from minimum-use status based on its disproportionate and qualitatively different impact upon highways and bridges. (3) The department shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. During the two years immediately following the effective date of this section, the department may promulgate temporary regulations, which shall expire no later than three years following the effective date of this paragraph or upon promulgation of final regulations, whichever occurs first. Temporary regulations promulgated by the department under this paragraph shall not be subject to any of the following: (i) Sections 201, 202 and 203 of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law. (ii) The Act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as the Regulatory Review Act. (d) Designation of alternate routes.-- (1) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsections (a) and (b), the Commonwealth may designate alternate routes for vehicles in excess of specified weights or sizes. Such alternate routes may utilize portions of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. (2) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsection (c), when refusing to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an alternate route study. The elements of an engineering and traffic study conducted to designate an alternate route pursuant to this section shall consist of the same elements found in department regulations. (e) Erection of signs.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities shall erect or cause to be erected and maintained restriction signs designating the restrictions within 25 feet of each end of a bridge or portion of highway restricted as provided in subsection (a) or (b). In the case of a restriction on a bridge or on a highway which does not begin or end at an intersection with an unrestricted highway, the Commonwealth or local authorities shall also place an advance informational sign at the intersection nearest each end of the restricted bridge or portion of highway which would allow drivers to avoid the restricted bridge or portion of highway. No person shall be convicted of violating subsection (a) or (b) unless the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the direction the person was driving was posted as required in this subsection. However, failure to post the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the opposite direction or failure to post any advance informational sign shall not constitute a defense to a violation of this section. (f) Actions to be in accordance with department regulations.-- All actions taken under authority of this section shall be taken in accordance with department regulations. (f.1) Local ordinances superseded.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, local authorities are prohibited from enacting or enforcing ordinances inconsistent with the provisions contained in this section. (g) Penalty.-- (1) Any person operating a vehicle or combination upon a highway or bridge in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (a) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $75, except that any person convicted of operating a vehicle with a gross weight in excess of a posted weight shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $150 plus $150 for each 500 pounds, or part thereof, in excess of 3,000 pounds over the maximum allowable weight. (2) Any person operating a vehicle or combination in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (b) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $500. (h) (Reserved). (i) Authority to conduct investigations and audits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an investigation and audit of a person or entity to determine if there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement. Audits shall be limited to proper usage of letters of local determination and de minimis and minimum-use permits. (j) Authority to suspend, revoke or deny permits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may suspend, revoke or deny a permit and agreement if it is determined by the Commonwealth or a local authority that there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

(c) Load of logs.-- (1) Every load of logs on a vehicle shall be securely fastened with binders, chains or straps and, in the case of an open-body or stake-body vehicle, trailer or semitrailer there shall be a sufficient number of vertical metal stakes or posts securely attached on each side of the vehicle, trailer or semitrailer at least as high as the top of the load to secure such load in the event of a failure of the binders, chains or straps. (2) A load of logs which are greater than six feet in length must be secured by three binders for each stack of logs, except that, if the stacks are tiered so that one stack rests upon the bottom stack or stacks, a total of three binders is necessary for that tiered combination. (3) A load of logs which are six feet or less in length must be secured by two binders for each stack of logs, except that, if the stacks are tiered so that one stack rests upon the bottom stack or stacks, a total of three binders is necessary for that tiered combination. (4) A tiered combination which includes logs which are greater than six feet and logs which are six feet or less shall be governed by paragraph (2). (c.1) Load of loose garbage.-- Every load of loose, nonbaled garbage, waste, refuse or rubbish being transported through or within this Commonwealth shall be transported in a vehicle with four solid sides and with a cover or top of a type to prevent any of the load from escaping. The cover or top shall remain tightly in place going to a disposal site. The load shall be no higher than the solid sides of the vehicle. It is imperative that all garbage, waste, refuse or rubbish be removed from the vehicle at the disposal site to prevent any scattering of litter on the highway during the return trip. No truck, trailer or semitrailer with an open body or stake body shall be used for such purposes. This subsection shall not apply to vehicles engaged in the systematic collection of garbage or refuse and which are designed to be open in the rear for the loading of garbage or refuse. (c.2) Load of baled garbage.-- Garbage, municipal waste, waste, refuse or rubbish in a tightly compacted and baled form being transported through or within this Commonwealth shall be securely fastened to the vehicle and covered over all exposed areas by being placed within a woven bag or with a canvas cover or cover of a comparable type. If a canvas cover or cover of a comparable type is used, the cover shall be securely attached to the underside of all sides of the truck, trailer or semitrailer by straps. A woven bag, canvas cover or cover of a comparable type shall have the purpose of preventing any of the material from the bales from escaping. No part of any bale shall be uncovered, except for inspection, at any time during transportation within or through this Commonwealth until arrival at the disposal site. (c.3) Load of equipment with hydraulically operated boom arm.-- The boom arm of equipment with a hydraulically operated boom arm being transported through or within this Commonwealth shall be securely fastened to the vehicle with steel restraining devices to prevent its movement or shifting during transit. (d) Establishment of standards for fastening devices.-- The department may promulgate regulations establishing minimum standards governing types and numbers of devices to be used in securing loads to prevent spillage and leakage of a load while in transit. (e) Exceptions.-- This section does not prohibit: (1) the necessary spreading of any substance in highway maintenance or construction operations; or (2) the shedding or dropping of feathers or other matter from vehicles hauling live or slaughtered birds or animals. (f) Penalty for violation of subsection (a), (b) or (c).-- A person who owns or who operates a vehicle in violation of subsection (a), (b) or (c) and, as a result of the violation, any item, piece, fragment or part of the load escapes and causes injury to a person or damage to another vehicle or other property commits a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $300 nor more than $1,000. A violation of subsection (a), (b) or (c) which does not result in injury to a person or damage to another vehicle or other property constitutes a summary offense, punishable by a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $300.

(c) Acquisition of part of common facilities.-- If part of the common facilities is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the award attributable to the interest of the association in the common facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining common facilities among the unit owners in proportion to the common expense liability attributable to the units before the taking, but any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common facility shall be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that limited common facility was allocated at the time of acquisition or in any manner as provided in the declaration. (d) Acquisition of part of controlled facilities.-- If, as part of a unit acquired by eminent domain, controlled facilities are taken which benefit other units, that portion of the award attributable to the interest of the other units in the controlled facilities taken shall be paid to the association.

If a member elects to receive this previous State service credit, The Pennsylvania State University shall make employer contributions equal to the amount that would have been contributed had employer contributions been made to the system concurrently with the rendering of the service, plus valuation interest to the day of the crediting of the service. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the amount due as member contributions and interest for an employee who is employed by the Applied Research Laboratory on June 3, 1984, who elects to purchase this credit with the State Employees' Retirement System shall not exceed the amount of contributions and interest certified as having been made to the pension plan administered by the Applied Research Laboratory during his employment with the Applied Research Laboratory.

The additional contributions paid by The Pennsylvania State University shall not be considered compensation for purposes of this part. (d) Transfer of certain pension service credit.-- (1) Any person who was an employee of any county in this Commonwealth on the personal staff of an appellate court judge prior to September 9, 1985, and who had that employment transferred to the Commonwealth pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 3703 (relating to local chamber facilities) shall be a member of the system for all service rendered as an employee of the Commonwealth on the personal staff of an appellate court judge subsequent to the date of the transfer unless specifically prohibited pursuant to section 5301(c) (relating to mandatory and optional membership in the system and participation in the plan). The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service credit in that county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous county employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer, by the member, county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's county or municipal pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the county or municipal pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by December 31, 1987, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by December 31, 1987. If the amount transferred to the system by the member of a county or municipal pension plan or retirement system is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service in accordance with county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system benefit provisions, multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members. The Public Employee Retirement Study Commission shall determine the appropriate amount of employer contributions to be transferred to the system by the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems. (2) If the member died prior to the effective date of this subsection, the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1). In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by December 31, 1987. If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before January 1, 1988, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by March 31, 1988. If the member dies after December 31, 1987, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), neither the member or his estate shall receive credit for the prior service. (e) Transfer and purchase of certain pension service credit; Philadelphia Regional Port Authority.-- (1) Any employee of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority who becomes a State employee, as defined in section 5102 (relating to definitions), and an active member of the system shall be eligible to obtain retirement credit for prior uncredited service with the Philadelphia Port Corporation, a Pennsylvania not-for-profit corporation (\"predecessor corporation\"), provided that the Commonwealth does not incur any liability for the funding of the annuities attributable to the prior, uncredited \"predecessor corporation\" service, the cost of which shall be determined according to paragraph (2). (2) The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service in the \"predecessor corporation\" transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, the provisions of section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer by the member or the \"predecessor corporation\" to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the member's pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by June 30, 1992, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the \"predecessor corporation\" pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by June 30, 1992. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall pay as pick-up contributions the difference between the amount credited to the member's account and the amount otherwise due under section 5504. Such additional contributions paid by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall not be considered compensation for the purposes of this part. If the amount transferred to the system by the member is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members so long as the amount to be transferred is equal to or less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee. In the event that the amount required to be transferred is greater than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee shall be transferred to the system, and the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system the additional funds needed to satisfy the requirements of the calculation in this paragraph. If the amount required to be transferred is less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority may retain the amount not needed for transfer. (3) If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before July 1, 1992, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or may request that the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by September 30, 1992. If the member dies after June 30, 1992, without making the transfer or without requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), neither the member nor his estate shall receive credit for the prior service. (4) Any person who became employed by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority between July 10, 1989, and passage of this act and who becomes a State employee, as defined in section 5102, and an active member of the system shall be eligible to obtain retirement credit for service from the date of employment with the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, provided that the contributions are made in accordance with sections 5501, 5504, 5505.1 and 5506. (f) Transfer of certain pension service credit; Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network.-- (1) An active member who is an employee of the Office of Attorney General and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network on December 31, 1992, shall be eligible to obtain State service credit for service with the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network for the period December 1, 1988, to July 31, 1991, upon payment of the required contributions by the member and Office of Attorney General and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network if the provisions of this subsection are satisfied. (2) The employee shall elect to receive the credit by filing an application with the board while an active member no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act. (3) Contributions to be paid by an active member for credit for New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be sufficient to provide an amount equal to the regular and additional accumulated deductions which would have been standing to the credit of the member for such service had regular and additional member contributions been made to the board with full coverage as a Class A member during the period of New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and had these regular and additional accumulated deductions been credited with statutory interest up to the date of purchase. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account.

Contributions paid by the Office of Attorney General shall be made out of Regional Information Sharing Systems Program grants and Federal funds received from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, United States Department of Justice, and in no event shall the contributions be the obligation of any other fund of the Commonwealth. The contributions shall not be considered compensation for purposes of this part. The full actuarial cost of the increased benefit attributable to the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be the difference between subparagraphs (i) and (ii) less the member's contribution: (i) the present value of a standard single life annuity, beginning at the earliest possible superannuation age, calculated assuming a 6.5% future salary increase, a 9% interest rate and standard postretirement mortality, assuming credit for the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service to be purchased; and (ii) the present value of a standard single life annuity, beginning at the earliest possible superannuation age, calculated assuming a 6.5% future salary increase, a 9% interest rate, standard postretirement mortality, excluding credit for the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service to be purchased.

(2) It shall not be necessary for the court to find the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but, on finding that the material allegations of the petition are true, the court shall order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises be used in violation of this chapter. Upon judgment of the court ordering the violations to be abated, the court may order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises shall be occupied or used for any purpose for up to one year following the date of the court's order, but the court may, in its discretion, permit the premises to be occupied or used by the operator or owner if the operator or owner, or both, posts a bond or a joint bond in the discretion of the court with sufficient surety to be approved by the court in the penal and liquidated sum of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and conditioned that neither the building nor a part of the building be used in violation of this chapter and that the operator will pay all fines, costs and damages that may be assessed for any violation of this chapter upon the premises. (3) Service of any preliminary or permanent injunction shall be made personally upon the operator and owner of the premises if such persons can be found in the county. If the operator or owner cannot be found, a copy of the order shall be delivered to any employee of the operator on the establishment premises or, in the case of the owner, upon an agent, if any. If no employee or agent can be found or service cannot be made on an employee or agent of the owner, then service shall be made as the court may direct. Any person other than the operator or owner who shall be served with any notice of an injunction shall within 24 hours thereafter deliver the notice to the operator or owner, as the case may be, or mail it to the operator or owner by registered mail if the address of the operator or owner, as the case may be, is known to the person served. Suspension by Court Order. Subsec. (b)(1) was suspended July 31, 1997, S.Ct. Order, to the extent that section 5506(b)(1) provides that Chapter 55, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity.",

      "text": "§ 5508. Actuarial cost method. (a) Employer contribution rate on behalf of active members.-- For each fiscal year, the amount of the Commonwealth and other employer contributions on behalf of all active members shall be computed by the actuary as a percentage of the total compensation of all active members during the period for which the amount is determined and shall be so certified by the board. The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall consist of the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b), and the accrued liability contribution rate as defined in subsection (c). The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall be modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in subsection (f). (b) Employer normal contribution rate.-- The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined after each actuarial valuation on the basis of an annual interest rate and such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the board in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined as follows: (1) From the effective date of this paragraph through fiscal year 2021-2022, as a level percentage of the compensation of the average new active member, which percentage, if contributed on the basis of his prospective compensation through his entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to him in excess of that portion funded by his prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (2) For fiscal year 2022-2023 and each fiscal year thereafter, as a level percentage of the compensation of all active members, which percentage, if contributed from the start of their employment on the basis of their prospective compensation through their entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to them in excess of that portion funded by their prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (c) Accrued liability contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2003, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits, except for the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708 (relating to supplemental annuities), 5708.1 (relating to additional supplemental annuities), 5708.2 (relating to further additional supplemental annuities), 5708.3 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1994), 5708.4 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment), 5708.5 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1998), 5708.6 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2002), 5708.7 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2003) and 5708.8 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002), in excess of the total assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all investment gains and losses over a five-year period), excluding the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members on December 31, 2001, and excluding contributions to be transferred by county retirement systems or pension plans pursuant to section 5507(c) (relating to contributions to the system by the Commonwealth and other employers). The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002, except that, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2002, but before July 1, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded over a period of ten years from the first day of July, coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution for such additional legislative liabilities shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the first annual payment. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, the outstanding balance of the increase in accrued liability due to the change in benefits enacted in 2001 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2002, and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in calendar year 2002 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2003. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2003, but before January 1, 2009, such additional liability shall be funded in equal dollar annual contributions over a period of ten years from the first day of July coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. (3) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund in equal dollar installments over a period of 30 years from July 1, 2010, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits calculated as of the immediately prior valuation date, including the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8, but excluding the benefits payable from the retirement benefit plan established pursuant to section 5941 (relating to benefits completion plan), in excess of the actuarially calculated assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses each year in level annual installments over five years), including the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer will receive for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members, inactive members on leave without pay, vestees and special vestees on December 31, 2009. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (4) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as provided for under this section, except that the rate shall be computed as a rate of total compensation of all active members and active participants for the applicable period and the accrued liability shall be determined and the rate shall be computed without regard to the portion of any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h) for which an annual setoff has not been credited or recognized in a prior fiscal year. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2016, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. In addition to any employer defined contributions made to the trust, the Commonwealth and other employers of participants shall make the accrued liability contributions to the fund certified by the board. (d) Special provisions on calculating contributions.-- In calculating the contributions required by subsections (a), (b) and (c), the active members of Class C shall be considered to be members of Class A. In addition, the actuary shall determine the Commonwealth or other employer contributions required for active members of Class C and officers of the Pennsylvania State Police and enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board who are members of Class A to finance their benefits in excess of those to which other members of Class A are entitled. Such additional contributions shall be determined separately for officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police and for enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. Such contributions payable on behalf of officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police shall include the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of May 12, 1943 (P.L.259, No.120), referred to as the Foreign Casualty Insurance Premium Tax Allocation Law, and on behalf of enforcement officers or investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of April 12, 1951 (P.L.90, No.21), known as the Liquor Code. (e) Supplemental annuity contribution rate.-- (1) For the period July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4 and 5708.5 shall be paid over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002. The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2002 provided for in section 5708.6 shall be as provided in section 5708.6(f). The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2003 provided for in section 5708.7 shall be as provided in section 5708.7(f). The funding for the special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002 under section 5708.8 shall be as provided in section 5708.8(g). The amount of each annual supplemental annuities contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002. (2) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8 shall be paid as part of the accrued liability contribution rate as provided for in subsection (c)(3), and there shall not be a separate supplemental annuity contribution rate attributable to those supplemental annuities. In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (f) Experience adjustment factor.-- (1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability and any increase or decrease in the liabilities and funding for supplemental annuities, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience (recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses over a five-year period), changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, State employees making shared-risk member contributions or having shared-gain adjustments to their regular member contributions, payment of additional accrued liability contributions under section 5507(g), changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of 30 years beginning with the July 1 succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases. The experience adjustment factor calculated under this paragraph shall be determined without regard to any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h). (2) The actuarially required contribution rate shall be the sum of the normal contribution rate, the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate, modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in paragraph (1). (g) Determination of liability for special vestee.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or other law, the total additional accrued actuarial liability resulting from eligibility of special vestees for benefits upon the attainment of superannuation age shall be determined by the actuary as part of the first annual valuation made after June 30, 1997. The resulting additional accrued actuarial liability shall be paid by The Pennsylvania State University to the board in one lump sum payment within 90 days of the board's certification of the amount to The Pennsylvania State University. (h) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.-- The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation to the prior year's final contribution rate. If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by the respective percentage above of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all subsequent fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not apply. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of total compensation of all active members. (i) Final contribution rate.-- For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate shall be 5% of total compensation of all active members. For each subsequent fiscal year for which the collared contribution rate is applicable, the final contribution rate shall be the collared contribution rate plus the costs added by legislation. For all other fiscal years, the final contribution rate shall be the actuarially required contribution rate, provided that the final contribution rate shall not be less than the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b).

(ii) The preliminary adjusted amounts shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a), (b) and (c). (4) In each successive year in which there is a positive percentage change in the CPI-U for the United States City Average, the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by the most recent preliminary adjusted amounts, and the products shall be added to the preliminary adjusted amount of the prior year to calculate the preliminary adjusted amounts for the current year. The sums thereof shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the new final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a), (b) and (c). (5) The determinations and adjustments required under this subsection shall be made in the period between October 1 and November 15 of the year following the effective date of this subsection and annually between October 1 and November 15 of each year thereafter.

(2) This subsection is intended to make unlawful the practice of evading advertising requirements by making a series of purchases or contracts each for less than the advertising requirement price or by making several simultaneous purchases or contracts each below that price when in either case the transaction involved should have been made as one transaction for one price. (3) An authority member who votes to unlawfully evade the provisions of this section and who knows that the transaction upon which the member votes is or ought to be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids commits a misdemeanor of the third degree for each contract entered into as a direct result of that vote. (i) Procurement.-- Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or of Title 62 (relating to procurement) to the contrary, an authority shall be considered a State-affiliated entity for purposes of compliance with Title 62.

(a) General rule.-- (1) If the annuitant returns to State service or enters or has entered school service and elects multiple service membership, any annuity payable to him under this part shall cease effective upon the date of his return to State service or entering school service without regard to whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member of the system or participant in the plan or, if a multiple service member, whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member or participant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System or School Employees' Defined Contribution Plan; and, in the case of an annuity other than a disability annuity the present value of such annuity, adjusted for full coverage in the case of a joint coverage member who makes the appropriate back contributions for full coverage, shall be frozen as of the date such annuity ceases. An annuitant who is credited with an additional 10% of Class A and Class C service as provided in section 5302(c) (relating to credited State service) and who returns to State service shall forfeit such credited service and shall have his frozen present value adjusted as if his 10% retirement incentive had not been applied to his account. In the event that the cost-of-living increase enacted December 18, 1979 occurred during the period of such State or school employment, the frozen present value shall be increased, on or after the member attains superannuation age, by the percent applicable had he not returned to service. (2) This subsection shall not apply in the case of any annuitant who: (i) may render services to the Commonwealth in the capacity of an independent contractor; or (ii) is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year and who may render service to the Commonwealth: (A) as a member of an independent board or commission or as a member of a departmental administrative or advisory board or commission when such members of independent or departmental boards or commissions are compensated on a per diem basis for not more than 150 days per calendar year; or (B) as a member of an independent board or commission requiring appointment by the Governor, with advice and consent of the Senate, where the annual salary payable to the member does not exceed $35,000 and where the member has been an annuitant for at least six months immediately preceding the appointment. (a.1) Return to State service during emergency.-- When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public, an annuitant who is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year may be returned to State service for a period not to exceed 95 days in any calendar year without loss of his annuity. In computing the number of days an annuitant has returned to State service, any amount of time less than one-half of a day shall be counted as one-half of a day. For agencies, boards and commissions under the Governor's jurisdiction, the approval of the Governor that an emergency exists shall be required before an annuitant may be returned to State service. (a.2) Return of benefits.-- In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 5705 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to State service or entering school service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member or school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid. (a.3) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.-- In the event that a former State employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount so received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board, but not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave, with the repayment period not to exceed five years or such longer time as may be agreed to between the board and the member. (a.4) Return to service as a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of the act of September 30, 1983 (P.L.160, No.39), known as the Public Official Compensation Law, 42 Pa.C.S. (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure) or any other provision of law or rule of court providing for or allowing a member of the judiciary to return to service as a senior judge, senior justice, senior magisterial district judge or in any administrative, fact finding, adjudicative, appellate or other capacity with any court or tribunal or in any other capacity for which compensation is received and to receive such compensation, whether paid on a per diem, hourly, salaried or other basis, in addition to any annuity payable under this part, any such member of the judiciary who returns to State service shall be subject to the provision of this section and section 5301 (relating to mandatory and optional membership) unless that member of the judiciary is over normal retirement age or has been an annuitant for more than one year. (a.5) No contributions or credited service.-- The service of an annuitant whose annuity does not cease upon his return to State or school service shall not be subject to member contributions or eligible for qualification as creditable State service and shall not be eligible for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions, voluntary contributions or employer defined contributions. (b) Subsequent discontinuance of service.-- Upon subsequent discontinuance of service, such terminating State employee other than a former annuitant who had the effect of his frozen present value eliminated in accordance with subsection (c) or a former disability annuitant shall be entitled to an annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the present value as determined under subsection (a) to which shall be added, if the service after reemployment was as a member of the system, the present value of a maximum single life annuity based on years of service credited subsequent to reentry in the system and his final average salary computed by reference to his compensation as a member of the system or as a member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System during his entire period of State and school service. (c) Elimination of the effect of frozen present value.-- (1) An annuitant who returns to State service as an active member of the system and earns three eligibility points as a member of the system by performing credited State service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, or an annuitant who enters school service other than as a Class DC participant and: (i) is a multiple service member; or (ii) who elects multiple service membership, and earns three eligibility points by performing credited State service as a member of the system or credited school service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, and who had the present value of his annuity frozen in accordance with subsection (a), shall qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value resulting from all previous periods of retirement eliminated, provided that all lump sum payments under Option 4 or under section 5705(a.1) and annuity payments payable during previous periods of retirement plus interest as set forth in paragraph (3) shall be returned to the fund in the form of an actuarial adjustment to his subsequent benefits or in such form as the board may otherwise direct. (2) Upon subsequent discontinuance of service and the filing of an application for an annuity, a former annuitant who qualifies to have the effect of a frozen present value eliminated under this subsection shall be entitled to receive the higher of either: (i) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the freezing of the former annuitant's account pursuant to subsection (a) had not occurred, adjusted by crediting Class A State service as Class AA service as provided for in section 5306(a.1) (relating to classes of service) and further adjusted according to paragraph (3), provided that a former annuitant of the system or a former annuitant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System who retired under a provision of law granting additional service credit if termination of State or school service or retirement occurred during a specific period of time shall not be permitted to retain the additional service credit under the prior law when the annuity is computed for his most recent retirement; or (ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value eliminated, unless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity. (3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement. The interest for each year shall be calculated based upon the annual interest rate adopted for that fiscal year by the board for the calculation of the normal contribution rate pursuant to section 5508(b) (relating to actuarial cost method).

(ii) The judge finds the specification is not practical. (2) In the case of an application with respect to a wire or electronic communication, all of the following apply: (i) The application identifies the person believed to be committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted and the applicant makes a showing that there is probable cause to believe that the person's actions could have the effect of thwarting interception by changing facilities or devices. (ii) The judge finds that the purpose has been adequately shown. (b) Supplementary orders.-- Following the issuance of a target-specific wiretap order, the judge shall sign supplementary orders upon request and in a timely manner, authorizing the investigative or law enforcement officers or agency to intercept additional communications devices or facilities upon a showing of reasonable suspicion that all of the following apply: (1) The target of the original order has in fact changed communications devices or facilities or is presently using additional communications devices, communications facilities or places.

(d) Time limits.-- A supplementary order shall not act as an extension of the time limit identified in section 5712(b).

Medallions may be pledged to lenders or creditors as security on debt. All lenders or creditors who, after the effective date of this section, accept a medallion as security shall do so in conformance with 13 Pa.C.S. (relating to commercial code). If a lender or creditor executes on or seizes a medallion, it shall immediately notify the authority in writing. Any sale of the medallion, upon seizure or execution, shall occur at authority offices pursuant to the requirements of section 5718 (relating to restrictions) within one year of the seizure or execution. If the medallion is not sold within one year, the medallion will become nontransferable, and possession must be surrendered to the authority unless the authority finds exigent circumstances exist which warrant extending the one-year period. (b) Licensing rights.-- A certificate of public convenience is a licensing right which accompanies each medallion and authorizes the operation of one taxicab within a city of the first class. No property interest shall exist in the certificate itself. A certificate may not be pledged to lenders or creditors as security on debt. A certificate may be canceled by the authority, upon due cause shown, for violation of this subchapter or authority regulations. If the authority cancels a certificate, the certificate holder shall have the right to sell the accompanying medallion within six months of the date of cancellation, and the certificate holder must turn the medallion over to the authority office within five days of cancellation of the certificate for safekeeping until the medallion is sold. This six-month time period shall be extended during the pendency of a petition for reinstatement of the certificate of public convenience.

(a) Designation.-- The Attorney General or a district attorney may designate supervising law enforcement officers for the purpose of authorizing the interception of wire or oral communications as provided in this section. (b) Procedure.-- A supervising law enforcement officer who reasonably determines that an emergency situation exists that requires a wire or oral communication to be intercepted before an order authorizing such interception can, with due diligence, be obtained, and who determines that there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under this chapter to authorize such interception, may intercept such wire or oral communication. An application for an order approving the interception must be made by the supervising law enforcement officer in accordance with section 5709 (relating to application for order) within 48 hours after the interception has occurred or begins to occur. Interceptions pursuant to this section shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures of this subchapter. Upon request of the supervising law enforcement officer who determines to authorize interceptions of wire communications under this section, a provider of electronic communication service shall provide assistance and be compensated therefor as provided in section 5712(f) (relating to issuance of order and effect). In the absence of an order, such interception shall immediately terminate when the situation giving rise to the hostage or barricade situation ends or when the application for the order is denied, whichever is earlier. In the event such application for approval is denied or in any other case where the interception is terminated without an order having been issued, the contents of any wire or oral communication intercepted shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this subchapter, and an inventory shall be served as provided in section 5716 (relating to service of inventory and inspection of intercepted communications). Thereafter, the supervising law enforcement officer shall follow the procedures set forth in section 5713(b) (relating to emergency situations). (c) Defense.-- A good faith reliance on the provisions of this section shall be a complete defense to any civil or criminal action brought under this subchapter or any other statute against any law enforcement officer or agency conducting any interceptions pursuant to this section as well as a provider of electronic communication service who is required to provide assistance in conducting such interceptions upon request of a supervising law enforcement officer. (d) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Emergency situation.\" Any situation where: (1) a person is holding a hostage and is threatening serious physical injury and may resist with the use of weapons; or (2) a person has barricaded himself and taken a position of confinement to avoid apprehension and: (i) has the ability to resist with the use of weapons; or (ii) is threatening suicide or harm to himself or others. \"Supervising law enforcement officer.\" (1) For designations by a district attorney, any law enforcement officer trained pursuant to section 5724 (relating to training) to carry out interceptions under this section who has attained the rank of lieutenant or higher in a law enforcement agency within the county or who is in charge of a county law enforcement agency. (2) For designations by the Attorney General, any member of the Pennsylvania State Police trained pursuant to section 5724 to carry out interceptions under this section and designated by the Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police who: (i) has attained the rank of lieutenant or higher; or (ii) is in charge of a Pennsylvania State Police barracks.

(a) Vehicles generally.-- (1) A vehicle may not be operated as a taxicab with citywide call or demand rights in cities of the first class unless a certificate of public convenience is issued by the authority authorizing the operation of the taxicab and a medallion is attached to the hood of the vehicle. Prior to the issuance of a medallion, the certificate holder shall have its vehicle inspected by the authority. (2) The authority shall require, by order or regulation, that each vehicle within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter submit to periodic inspections by authority personnel to ensure that the vehicle meets the requirements of this subchapter and authority regulations. (3) Authority inspection requirements for vehicles within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to the vehicle requirements set forth in Title 75 (relating to vehicles) and may include vehicle age and mileage limitations. Authority inspection and recording requirements shall be established by regulations. (4) No vehicle which is more than eight years old shall continue in operation as a taxicab. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority may authorize the operation of antique vehicles in call or demand service in such circumstances as the authority may deem appropriate. (5) Each taxicab certificate holder's tariff rates shall be clearly and visibly displayed in each taxicab. (6) A medallion shall not be removed from a vehicle without prior notification to and permission of the authority. (7) A medallion authorizes operation of a vehicle as a taxicab only for the fiscal year for which the medallion is issued. (b) Driver security devices.-- Each vehicle authorized to provide taxicab service shall be equipped with such security devices as the authority may, in its discretion, require by order or regulation. (c) Service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon call or demand and parcels, packages and property at the same basic metered rates charged to passengers: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its centralized dispatch system; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as a continuous part of a trip. (d) Other vehicles.-- (1) A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission authorizing call or demand service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and property: (i) to cities of the first class in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (ii) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond that city of the first class if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its radio dispatch service. (2) Carriers authorized by the authority to provide taxicab service to designated areas within cities of the first class on a non-citywide basis pursuant to section 5711(c)(2.1) (relating to power of authority to issue certificates of public convenience) shall retain their authorization in those areas of a city of the first class subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the authority and orders and regulations of the authority issued under this chapter. The authority shall not grant additional rights to new or existing carriers to serve designated areas within cities of the first class on a non-citywide basis. (e) Penalties involving certificated taxicabs.-- Operating a certificated taxicab in violation of subsections (a) and (b) or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders of subsections (a) and (b) may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725 (relating to civil penalties). (f) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a taxicab, or giving the appearance of offering call or demand service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience and a medallion is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each offense thereafter. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as or appearing as a taxicab without a certificate of public convenience and a medallion are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (g) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) The authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles, medallions and equipment which are utilized to provide call or demand service in cities of the first class without a proper certificate of public convenience issued by the authority or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and payment of the costs of the authority associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle, medallion and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction. (ii) To all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner and operator of the confiscated property.

      "text": "§ 5741. Certificate of public convenience required. (a) General rule.-- In order to operate a limousine service within a city of the first class, the limousine service must have a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority under section 5741.1 (relating to power of authority). The authority may grant a certificate of public convenience to provide limousine service if the authority determines that the applicant is capable of providing safe, adequate, lawful and dependable service to the public. The authority may by regulation define categories of limousine service. The authority may separately grant certificates of public convenience for each category of limousine service and specify the rights associated with the certificates of public convenience by category of limousine service. (a.1) Advance reservation limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service within a city of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon advance reservation: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate issued; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as part of a continuous trip. (a.2) Other limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide nonexclusive, scheduled limousine service may transport persons and their baggage to or from any airport, railroad station or hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class without advance reservation in accordance with rules and regulations established by the authority. (a.3) Commission limousine certificate holders.-- A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service in a city of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the commission authorizing limousine service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and their baggage: (1) to a city of the first class upon advance reservation and in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (2) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond the city of the first class upon advance reservation in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience, excluding service from any airport, railroad station and hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class. (b) Enforcement.-- (1) The provisions of this subchapter and the rules and regulations promulgated by the authority pursuant to this subchapter shall be enforced within cities of the first class by authority personnel. (2) The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission may initiate actions before the authority. (c) Restrictions.-- (1) Certificates issued pursuant to this subchapter shall be nontransferable unless a transfer is approved by the authority. (2) A limousine service provider operating pursuant to an authority-issued certificate of public convenience and a filed tariff permitting the limousine service provider to charge mileage-based rates on the effective date of this paragraph shall be permitted to continue to charge mileage-based rates and to be regulated in the same manner as traditional limousine service providers. (d) Penalties involving certified limousines.-- Operating a certificated limousine in violation of this subchapter and authority regulations with regard to limousine service in a city of the first class or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745 (relating to civil penalties). (e) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a limousine or giving the appearance of offering limousine service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience, is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each subsequent offense. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as a limousine without a certificate of public convenience are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (f) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) In addition to penalties provided for in subsections (d) and (e), the authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles and equipment which are utilized to provide limousine service without a proper certificate of public convenience in a city of the first class or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and equipment and payment of the authority's costs associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction. (ii) To all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner and operator of the confiscated property. (iii) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the lien of any registered lienholder of the confiscated property upon demand. (iv) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the registered owner of the confiscated property upon demand. (v) When not claimed by any registered lienholder or registered owner within one year of the auction date, remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the fund. (f.1) Assessment.-- After application of the proceeds from the sale of confiscated property under subsection (f), the uncompensated costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction and all outstanding penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property may be assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property as the authority may prescribe by regulation.

(B) The third-party surety's failure to discover and report the violation was due to willful disregard to the safety of a witness, victim or the general public in circumstances related to the conditions under subsection (a).

(4) A civil penalty may not be assessed and a license suspension or revocation may not be imposed against a third-party surety for any of the following: (i) Failure to report a known violation under subsection (a), if the third-party surety provides evidence that the violation was reported to a law enforcement agency under subsection (b). (ii) Lack of knowledge of the bail conditions, if the third-party surety provides evidence that the third-party surety attempted to obtain information about the bail conditions which went unanswered or refused or that the bail conditions were altered subsequent to the defendant's release and the third-party surety lacked information about the amended conditions. (iii) Willful disregard to the safety of a witness, victim or the general public, if: (A) the third-party surety provides evidence that the third-party surety reviewed the bail conditions with the defendant within 24 hours of release and during instances of contact between the third-party surety and the defendant; and (B) if the defendant indicated a willingness to commit a violation under subsection (a), the third-party surety reported the risk to the attorney for the Commonwealth or the law enforcement agency, if the attorney for the Commonwealth is unavailable. (d) Bail forfeiture.-- Nothing under this section shall preclude the attorney for the Commonwealth from seeking a bail forfeiture directly from the defendant.

(d) Grounds for personal search of a department-supervised offender.-- (1) A personal search of an offender may be conducted by an agent: (i) if there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that the department-supervised offender possesses contraband or other evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision; (ii) when a department-supervised offender is transported or taken into custody; or (iii) upon a department-supervised offender entering or leaving the secure enclosure of a correctional institution, jail or detention facility.

(3) The department-supervised offender may be detained if the department-supervised offender is present during a property search. If the department-supervised offender is not present during a property search, the agent in charge of the search shall make a reasonable effort to provide the department-supervised offender with notice of the search, including a list of the items seized, after the search is completed. (4) The existence of reasonable suspicion to search shall be determined in accordance with constitutional search and seizure provisions as applied by judicial decision. In accordance with such case law, the following factors, where applicable, may be taken into account: (i) The observations of agents. (ii) Information provided by others. (iii) The activities of the department-supervised offender. (iv) Information provided by the department-supervised offender. (v) The experience of agents with the department-supervised offender.

If the final determination of the Office of Victim Advocate is that the denial of the agency's request for waiver has been improperly denied, the Office of Victim Advocate shall grant the agency's request for waiver in accordance with this section. The final determination of the Office of Victim Advocate shall be the final order of the Office of Victim Advocate.

The Interstate Corrections Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this State with any other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: INTERSTATE CORRECTIONS COMPACT ARTICLE I Purpose and Policy The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had. (c) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had. (d) \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution. (e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including, but not limited to, a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined. ARTICLE III Contracts (a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration. 2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance. 3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any, the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom. 4. Delivery and retaking of inmates. 5. Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states. (b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith. ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights (a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. (b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. (c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III. (d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state. (e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state. (f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. (g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory. (h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state. (i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact. ARTICLE V Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition (a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference. (b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VI Federal Aid Any state party to this compact may accept Federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such Federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provisions, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor. ARTICLE VII Entry into Force This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state. ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact. ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements. ARTICLE X Construction and Severability The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",

      "text": "§ 7601. Compact enacted. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: Article I Purpose and Authorities This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this compact, the term \"states\" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and all U.S. territorial possessions. The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack. This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states. Article II General Implementation Each party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist. The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood. On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact. Article III Party State Responsibilities A. It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall: 1. review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resources shortages, civil disorders, insurgency or enemy attack; 2. review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency; 3. develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans; 4. assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries; 5. protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material; 6. inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness; and 7. provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities. B. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance to another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this compact shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information: 1. a description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, including, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building, inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue; 2. the amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed; and 3. the specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location. C. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities. Article IV Limitations Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer. Article V Licenses and Permits Whenever any person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise. Article VI Liability Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes. No party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness. Article VII Supplementary Agreements Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein shall preclude any state entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies. Article VIII Compensation Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state. Article IX Reimbursement Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense or other cost or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this article. Article X Evacuation Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees. Article XI Implementation A. This compact shall become effective immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon enactment by such state. B. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until 30 days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. C. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States Government. Article XII Validity This compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected. Article XIII Additional Provisions Nothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into Federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under section 1385 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

(c) Simultaneous relief.-- A petition or comparable pleading seeking a remedy that must be affirmatively sought under other law of this State may be filed at the same time as the request for registration or later.

(a) Authority.-- After a child support order issued in another state has been registered in this State, the responding tribunal of this State may modify that order, upon petition, only if section 7613 (relating to jurisdiction to modify child support order of another state when individual parties reside in this State) does not apply and after notice and hearing it finds one of the following: (1) The following requirements are met: (i) the child, the individual obligee and the obligor do not reside in the issuing state; (ii) a petitioner who is a nonresident of this State seeks modification; and (iii) the respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this State. (2) This State is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this State; and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this State to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order. (b) General rule.-- Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this State, and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner. (c) Restriction.-- A tribunal of this State may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support. If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under section 7207 (relating to determination of controlling child support order) establishes the aspects of the support order which are not modifiable. (c.1) Modification.-- In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this State. (d) Continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.-- On issuance of an order by a tribunal of this State modifying a child support order issued in another state, a tribunal of this State becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. (e) Filing.-- (Deleted by amendment). (f) Retained jurisdiction.-- Notwithstanding subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) or section 7201(b) (relating to bases for jurisdiction over nonresident), a tribunal of this State retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this State if the following are met: (1) One party resides in another state. (2) The other party resides outside the United States. (Dec. 16, 1997, P.L.549, No.58, eff. Jan. 1, 1998; Dec. 28, 2015, P.L.559, No.94, eff. imd.) 1997 Amendment.

(a) Appointment and jurisdiction of independent counsel.-- (1) Upon receipt of an application, the panel shall appoint an appropriate independent counsel and shall define that independent counsel's prosecutorial jurisdiction. The appointment shall occur no later than 30 days after the receipt of the application. (2) The panel shall appoint as independent counsel an individual who has appropriate experience and who will conduct the investigation and any prosecution in a prompt, responsible and cost-effective manner. The panel shall seek to appoint as independent counsel an individual who will serve to the extent necessary to complete the investigation and any prosecution without undue delay. The panel may not appoint as an independent counsel any person who holds any office of profit or trust with the Commonwealth. A person who is serving as a special investigative counsel may not be appointed or serve as an independent counsel in the matter for which the person had been appointed to investigate as special investigative counsel. If an independent counsel is appointed, the independent counsel may only accept the appointment when the appointment would not conflict with the rules governing professional conduct. (3) In defining the independent counsel's prosecutorial jurisdiction, the panel shall assure that the independent counsel has adequate authority to fully investigate and prosecute the subject matter with respect to which the special investigative counsel has requested the appointment of the independent counsel and all matters related to that subject matter. Jurisdiction shall also include the authority to investigate and prosecute an offense classified higher than a summary offense or a contempt of court which may arise out of the investigation with respect to which the special investigative counsel's request was made. (4) The panel shall disclose the identity of the independent counsel upon appointment. (b) Expansion of jurisdiction.-- (1) The panel upon the request of a district attorney or a requesting judge may expand the prosecutorial jurisdiction of an independent counsel. The expansion may be in lieu of the appointment of another independent counsel. (2) If the independent counsel discovers or receives information about possible violations of criminal law by persons as provided in section 9512 (relating to preliminary investigation) which are not covered by the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel, the independent counsel may submit the information to a district attorney. In accordance with this subchapter, a district attorney shall petition the panel to appoint a special investigative counsel to conduct a preliminary investigation of the information, except that the preliminary investigation shall not exceed 30 days from the date the information is received. In making the determinations required by this subchapter, the special investigative counsel shall give great weight to any recommendations of the independent counsel. (3) If the special investigative counsel determines, after according great weight to the recommendations of the independent counsel, that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted, the special investigative counsel shall promptly notify the panel. (4) The panel shall expand the jurisdiction of the appropriate independent counsel to include the matters involved or shall appoint another independent counsel to investigate the matters if: (i) the special investigative counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted; or (ii) the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (2) elapses without a notification to the panel that no further investigation is warranted. (5) If the independent counsel discovers or receives information about possible violations of criminal law by persons other than those provided for in section 9512 and which are not covered by the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel and a request for expansion under this subsection has not been made by a district attorney or a requesting judge or the request for expansion under this subsection has been denied by the panel, the independent counsel shall submit the information to the appropriate law enforcement authority. (c) Return for further explanation.-- Upon receipt of a notification under this subchapter that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted with respect to information received under this chapter, the panel shall have no authority to overrule this determination but may return the matter to the special investigative counsel for further explanation of the reasons for the determination. (d) Vacancies.-- If a vacancy in office arises by reason of the resignation, death or removal of an independent counsel, the panel shall appoint an independent counsel to complete the work of the independent counsel whose resignation, death or removal caused the vacancy, except that, in the case of a vacancy arising by reason of the removal of an independent counsel, the panel may appoint an acting independent counsel to serve until any judicial review of the removal is completed.",

(2) That the conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the following: (i) A violation of the Constitution of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place. (ii) Ineffective assistance of counsel which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place. (iii) A plea of guilty unlawfully induced where the circumstances make it likely that the inducement caused the petitioner to plead guilty and the petitioner is innocent. (iv) The improper obstruction by government officials of the petitioner's right of appeal where a meritorious appealable issue existed and was properly preserved in the trial court. (v) (Deleted by amendment). (vi) The unavailability at the time of trial of exculpatory evidence that has subsequently become available and would have changed the outcome of the trial if it had been introduced. (vii) The imposition of a sentence greater than the lawful maximum. (viii) A proceeding in a tribunal without jurisdiction. (3) That the allegation of error has not been previously litigated or waived. (4) That the failure to litigate the issue prior to or during trial, during unitary review or on direct appeal could not have been the result of any rational, strategic or tactical decision by counsel. (b) Exception.-- Even if the petitioner has met the requirements of subsection (a), the petition shall be dismissed if it appears at any time that, because of delay in filing the petition, the Commonwealth has been prejudiced either in its ability to respond to the petition or in its ability to re-try the petitioner. A petition may be dismissed due to delay in the filing by the petitioner only after a hearing upon a motion to dismiss. This subsection does not apply if the petitioner shows that the petition is based on grounds of which the petitioner could not have discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the delay became prejudicial to the Commonwealth. (c) Extradition.-- If the petitioner's conviction and sentence resulted from a trial conducted in his absence and if the petitioner has fled to a foreign country that refuses to extradite him because a trial in absentia was employed, the petitioner shall be entitled to the grant of a new trial if the refusing country agrees by virtue of this provision to return him and if the petitioner upon such return to this jurisdiction so requests.

Notwithstanding the foregoing comparable bandwidth limitation, where a request includes individual customer requests for advanced services having equal to or less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) bandwidth in the downstream direction, all lines in the request shall be counted in meeting the minimum line requirement of this subparagraph; (ii) the name, address, telephone number and signature of each existing retail customer requesting the advanced service, the advanced service being requested and the number of access lines for which the advanced service is being requested; (iii) the name, address and telephone number of a designated contact person where the request is made by or on behalf of more than one person or business; and (iv) a commitment by each customer who signs the request to subscribe to the requested service for one year, subject to the local exchange telecommunications company's identification of the price and terms of the service and the customer's agreement to the price and terms. (3) In administering the bona fide retail request program, the local exchange telecommunications company shall: (i) establish an Internet website and toll-free telephone number to address customer inquiries regarding the program; (ii) mail a request form to a customer upon request; (iii) confirm its receipt of any completed request in writing to the customer and identify the service requested; (iv) as part of the written confirmation, if available, or in a subsequent written communication to the customer, provide the customer the applicable rate, the contract term, the status of the request and a term subscription agreement for execution; and (v) notify the customers in a community, within 30 days of receipt of a bona fide request, of the expected date of the availability of the requesters' service. (4) When a bona fide retail request has been received that meets the requirements of paragraph (2), the local exchange telecommunications company shall provide the requested advanced service, or other reasonably comparable service having a bandwidth within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of the requested service, to the community as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 365 days of the date the requirements of paragraph (2) have been met or within the period approved by the commission under paragraph (5) or (6) where: (i) the local exchange telecommunications company provides the requested advanced service to other customers in its service territory; (ii) no service is available to the requesting customers from an alternative service provider at or within 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) of the data speed requested or such service is available at a price that exceeds the then current price offered by the local exchange telecommunications company by more than 50%; (iii) the community is situated within the service territory of the local exchange telecommunications company; and (iv) the local exchange telecommunications company does not have to provide fiber to the customer's premises to furnish the requested advanced service. (5) Where, as a result of property acquisition, including acquiring rights-of-way, or new construction, a local exchange telecommunications company is unable to provide the requested advanced service within the one-year period set forth in paragraph (4), the company may petition the commission for an extension of up to six months, with service upon the customer or customers who made the bona fide retail request and the department if the department submitted the request on behalf of the customer or customers. The commission may delegate its authority to rule on such petitions to a bureau director or other appropriate employee who shall grant the petition for good cause shown. (6) Where the total number of bona fide retail requests received by any local exchange telecommunications company or affiliated companies that meet the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4) exceed 40 requests in any 12-month period or where there are more than 20 such requests that require property acquisition, including acquiring rights-of-way, or new construction in any 12-month period, the local exchange telecommunications company or companies may provide a verified certification to the commission that one or both of the previously stated criteria are met, with service upon the customer or customers who made the additional requests and upon the department if the department submitted any such requests. Upon receipt of the certification, the commission or the commission through its designated staff shall permit the local exchange telecommunications company or companies to extend the time for such deployments for a period of no more than 12 months unless the commission determines an additional time period to be just and reasonable. If a deployment is extended, it shall be counted in determining the maximum number of deployments provided for under this subsection in any 12-month period covering the month to which it is extended. (7) No advanced service requested and deployed by a local exchange telecommunications company under the bona fide retail request program which has a bandwidth of less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) in the downstream direction shall be counted as a credit toward the local exchange telecommunications company's broadband deployment obligation under its network modernization plan amended pursuant to subsection (b)(2) or (3). (8) With regard to requests submitted under this subsection, a retail customer may challenge the action of a local exchange telecommunications company pursuant to section 701 (relating to complaints). (9) Local exchange telecommunications companies with bona fide retail request programs shall provide semiannual reports to the commission and the department of the number of requests for advanced services received during the reporting period by exchange or density cell and the action taken on requests meeting the requirements of this subsection. (10) A local exchange telecommunication company's bona fide retail request program established under this subsection shall continue through December 31, 2015, or such earlier date as the local exchange telecommunications company achieves 100% broadband availability throughout its service territory. (11) In addition to adjudicating any complaints brought by customers under paragraph (8), the commission shall monitor and enforce the compliance of participating local exchange telecommunications companies with their obligations under this subsection. (d) Business attraction or retention program.-- (1) Not later than 90 days after amending its network modernization plan under subsection (b)(2) or (3), the local exchange telecommunications company shall establish a business attraction or retention program to permit the department to aggregate customer demand where necessary and facilitate the deployment of advanced or broadband services to qualifying businesses which the department seeks to attract to or retain in this Commonwealth and whose requests for such services are submitted by or through the department. (2) Each local exchange telecommunications company which amends its network modernization plan under subsection (b)(2) or (3) not later than 90 days after the effective date of its amended plan shall designate a single point of contact to receive all written advanced or broadband service requests forwarded by the department, provide associated contact information to the department and provide the department and the commission with a written description of its participation in the program and a sample request for advanced or broadband services form for use in the program. (3) The department may submit a request to the applicable local exchange telecommunications company by or on behalf of qualifying businesses in areas that the department deems priority areas for economic development, including and giving preference to keystone opportunity zones, keystone opportunity expansion zones, enterprise zones, keystone opportunity improvement zones and other areas identified by the department as lacking adequate access to advanced or broadband services which would be important in order to promote economic development projects in those areas. (4) The department shall establish an advisory committee that shall consist of representatives of each local exchange telecommunications company with a business attraction or retention program, local development districts and other local economic and industrial development agencies to assist the department in developing protocols and procedures for implementing these programs pursuant to this subsection. (5) Qualifying business or businesses' requests for advanced services submitted by the department that are provisioned through the bona fide retail request program shall be processed in accordance with subsection (c) and shall be allocated 50% of the maximum number of annual deployments referenced in subsection (c)(6). Other requests shall be allocated 50% of the number of such deployments, provided, however, that any allocated deployments that are unused may be utilized by the department or nondepartment applicants, as applicable. (6) For qualifying business or businesses whose request for advanced services is determined by the local exchange telecommunications company to be better processed outside of the bona fide retail request program, the local exchange telecommunications company shall make a proposal to the requesting business or businesses to provide the requested advanced or broadband service and subsequently shall provision such service. The local exchange telecommunications company shall advise the department and the business or businesses within 30 days of the date the contract is signed of the date by which the requested advanced or broadband service will be provided, which date shall be not later than one year after the date the contract is signed unless the business or businesses agree to a longer period or the local exchange telecommunications company obtains commission approval of an extension under the same procedure set forth in subsection (c)(5). (7) No advanced service requested of and deployed by a local exchange telecommunications company under the Business Attraction or Retention Program which has a bandwidth of less than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps) in the downstream direction shall be counted as a credit toward the local exchange telecommunication company's broadband deployment obligation under its network modernization plan amended under subsection (b)(2) or (3). (8) Each local exchange telecommunications company which is required to participate in the department's Business Attraction or Retention Program shall continue its participation through December 31, 2015, or such earlier date as it achieves 100% broadband availability throughout its service territory. (9) The department shall oversee local exchange telecommunications company participation in the Business Attraction or Retention Program, including the timely completion of qualifying advanced or broadband services requests submitted by or through the department which are processed within or outside of the participating local exchange telecommunications companies' bona fide retail request programs. (10) The commission shall monitor and enforce the compliance of participating local exchange telecommunications companies with their obligations under the Business Attraction or Retention Program. (e) Notice of filing of amendments.-- A local exchange telecommunications company that elects to amend its network modernization plan under subsection (b) shall notify the commission in writing of such election and, within 60 days following such notification, file its amended network modernization plan with the commission. Copies of the written notice of election and of the amended network modernization plan shall be served by the local exchange telecommunications company on the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate. Concurrent with the filing of the amended plan with the commission, the local exchange telecommunications company shall publish notice of such filing in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in its service territory or by bill message or insert. An amended plan compliant with the requirements of this chapter shall be approved by the commission within 100 days of its filing. If the commission fails to act within 100 days, the amended plan shall be deemed approved. (f) Network modernization plan report.-- (1) A local exchange telecommunications company operating under a network modernization plan shall continue to file with the commission biennial reports on its provision of broadband availability in the form and detail required by the commission as of July 1, 2004, unless such reporting requirements are subsequently reduced by the commission. (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impede the ability of the commission to require the submission of further information to support the accuracy of or to seek an explanation of the reports specified in this subsection. (3) Under no circumstances shall the commission compel the public release of maps or other information describing the actual location of a local exchange telecommunications company's facilities. (g) Assistance to political subdivisions.-- A local exchange telecommunications company shall commit in its amended network modernization plan to make technical assistance available to political subdivisions located in its service territory in pursuing the deployment of additional telecommunications infrastructure or services by the local exchange telecommunications company.

(2) A political subdivision may offer advanced or broadband services if the political subdivision has submitted a written request for the deployment of such service to the local exchange telecommunications company serving the area and, within two months of receipt of the request, the local exchange telecommunications company or one of its affiliates has not agreed to provide the data speeds requested. If the local exchange telecommunications company or one of its affiliates agrees to provide the data speeds requested, then it must do so within 14 months of receipt of the request. (3) The prohibition in paragraph (1) shall not be construed to preclude the continued provision or offering of telecommunications services by a political subdivision of the same type and scope as were being provided on the effective date of this section. (i) Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Program.-- (1) The department shall establish a Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Program for the purpose of making expenditures and providing grants from the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund established under section 3015(c) (relating to alternative forms of regulation) for: (i) Outreach programs for political subdivisions, economic development entities, schools, health care facilities, businesses and residential customers concerning the benefits, use and procurement of broadband services; and (ii) Seed grants to aggregate customer demand for broadband services in communities or political subdivisions with limited access to such services and to permit customers in such communities or political subdivisions to request such services from a telecommunications provider. (2) The department shall annually report to the commission on all payments to and expenditures from the Broadband Outreach and Aggregation Fund, and the commission shall verify the accuracy of the contributions from the participating local exchange telecommunications companies. (j) Education Technology Program.-- (1) The Department of Education shall establish an Education Technology Program for the purpose of providing grants to school entities from the Education Technology Fund (E-Fund) established under section 3015(d).

(4) No later than 90 days after the effective date of this section, the Department of Education shall prescribe the grant process and the form and manner of the E-Fund application. Grants shall be limited to the funds available in the Education Technology Fund. In awarding grants, the Department of Education shall give priority to applications: (i) that are submitted by school entities that seek funds for discounted broadband services under subsection (l) or for broadband infrastructure, facilities or equipment from local exchange telecommunications companies which contribute to the E-Fund; (ii) that seek funds for regional networks that serve multiple school districts which are filed on behalf of multiple school districts and school entities; or (iii) that are submitted by school entities that do not have broadband service, provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall preclude the department from awarding funds to school entities for telecommunications services, infrastructure or facilities that provide bandwidths greater than 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps).

(a) Acquisition of services.-- (1) A person is guilty of theft if he intentionally obtains services for himself or for another which he knows are available only for compensation, by deception or threat, by altering or tampering with the public utility meter or measuring device by which such services are delivered or by causing or permitting such altering or tampering, by making or maintaining any unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically or inductively, to a distribution or transmission line, by attaching or maintaining the attachment of any unauthorized device to any cable, wire or other component of an electric, telephone or cable television system or to a television receiving set connected to a cable television system, by making or maintaining any unauthorized modification or alteration to any device installed by a cable television system, or by false token or other trick or artifice to avoid payment for the service. (1.1) A person is guilty of theft if he intentionally obtains or attempts to obtain telecommunication service by the use of an unlawful telecommunication device or without the consent of the telecommunication service provider. (2) (Deleted by amendment). (3) A person is not guilty of theft of cable television service under this section who subscribes to and receives service through an authorized connection of a television receiving set at his dwelling and, within his dwelling, makes an unauthorized connection of an additional television receiving set or sets or audio system which receives only basic cable television service obtained through such authorized connection. (4) Where compensation for service is ordinarily paid immediately upon the rendering of such service, as in the case of hotels and restaurants, refusal to pay or absconding without payment or offer to pay gives rise to a presumption that the service was obtained by deception as to intention to pay. (b) Diversion of services.-- A person is guilty of theft if, having control over the disposition of services of others to which he is not entitled, he knowingly diverts such services to his own benefit or to the benefit of another not entitled thereto. (c) Grading.-- (1) An offense under this section constitutes a summary offense when the value of the services obtained or diverted is less than $50. (2) When the value of the services obtained or diverted is $50 or more, the grading of the offense shall be as established in section 3903 (relating to grading of theft offenses). (3) Amounts involved in theft of services committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same person or several persons, may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense. (d) Inferences.-- (1) Any person having possession of or access to the location of a public utility meter or service measuring device which has been avoided or tampered with so as to inhibit or prevent the accurate measurement of utility service and who enjoys the use of or receives the benefit from the public utility service intended to be metered or measured by the public utility meter or measuring device so avoided or tampered with may be reasonably inferred to have acted to avoid or tamper with the public utility meter or measuring device with the intent to obtain the public utility service without making full compensation therefor. (2) Any person having possession of or access to the location of the distribution or transmission lines or other facilities of a cable television system which have been tapped, altered or tampered with or to which any unauthorized connection has been made or to which any unauthorized device has been attached or any person having possession of or access to any device installed by a cable television system to which an unauthorized modification or alteration has been made, the result of which tapping, altering, tampering, connection, attachment or modification is to avoid payment for all or any part of the cable television service for which payment is normally required, and who enjoys the use of or receives the benefit from the cable television service, may be reasonably inferred to have acted to have tapped, altered, tampered with, connected or attached to or modified cable television facilities with the intent to obtain cable television service without making full compensation therefor.

(5) destroys, removes, renders inoperative or deactivates any inventory control tag, security strip or any other mechanism designed or employed to prevent an offense under this section with the intention of depriving the merchant of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value thereof.

(ii) Misdemeanor of the second degree when the offense is a second offense and the value of the merchandise is less than $150. (iii) Misdemeanor of the first degree when the offense is a first or second offense and the value of the merchandise is $150 or more.

(2) Amounts involved in retail thefts committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same store or retail mercantile establishment or several stores or retail mercantile establishments, may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense.

Such detention shall not impose civil or criminal liability upon the peace officer, merchant, employee, or agent so detaining. (e) Reduction prohibited.-- No magisterial district judge shall have the power to reduce any other charge of theft to a charge of retail theft as defined in this section.

Fingerprints so obtained shall be forwarded immediately to the Pennsylvania State Police for determination as to whether or not the defendant previously has been convicted of the offense of retail theft. The results of such determination shall be forwarded to the Police Department obtaining the fingerprints if such department is the prosecutor, or to the issuing authority if the prosecutor is other than a police officer. The issuing authority shall not proceed with the trial or plea in summary cases until in receipt of the determination made by the State Police.

(2) As a contempt of the court making such order. No finding of contempt shall be a bar to prosecution for a substantive offense under section 2709 (relating to harassment), 2709.1 (relating to stalking), 4952 (relating to intimidation of witnesses or victims) or 4953 (relating to retaliation against witness or victim), but: (i) any person so held in contempt shall be entitled to credit for any punishment imposed therein against any sentence imposed on conviction of said substantive offense; and (ii) any conviction or acquittal for any substantive offense under this title shall be a bar to subsequent punishment for contempt arising out of the same act. (3) By revocation of any form of pretrial release, or the forfeiture of bail and the issuance of a bench warrant for the defendant's arrest or remanding him to custody. Revocation may, after hearing and on substantial evidence, in the sound discretion of the court, be made whether the violation of order complained of has been committed by the defendant personally or was caused or encouraged to have been committed by the defendant. (b) Arrest.-- An arrest for a violation of an order issued under section 4954 may be without warrant upon probable cause whether or not the violation is committed in the presence of a law enforcement officer.

When that court is unavailable, the defendant shall be arraigned before a magisterial district judge or, in cities of the first class, a Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge, in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure.

(d) Time limits.-- A supplementary order shall not act as an extension of the time limit identified in section 5712(b). (e) Responsibility.-- The order shall require the Attorney General or the district attorney, or their designees, to be responsible for the supervision of the interception. (f) Progress reports.-- If an order authorizing an interception is entered, the order may require reports to be made to the judge who issued the order showing what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception. The reports shall be made at intervals as the judge may require. (g) Final report.-- If an interception is authorized under this section, a complete written list of names of participants and evidence of offenses discovered, including those not stated in the application for order, shall be filed with the court as soon as practical after the authorized interception is terminated. (h) Assistance.-- (1) An order authorizing the interception of a wire, electronic or oral communication shall, upon request of the applicant, direct that a provider of communication service furnish the applicant with all information, facilities and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the interception unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the services that the service provider is affording the person whose communications are to be intercepted. (2) The obligation of a provider of communication service under an order may include installation of a pen register or trap and trace device and disclosure of a record or other information otherwise available under section 5743 (relating to requirements for governmental access), including conducting an in-progress trace during an interception, if the obligation of a provider of communications service is technologically feasible. (3) A provider of communication service furnishing facilities or technical assistance shall be compensated by the applicant for reasonable expenses incurred in providing the facilities or assistance. (4) A service provider shall be immune from civil and criminal liability for any assistance rendered to an applicant under this section. (i) Entry by law enforcement officers.-- An order authorizing the interception of a wire, electronic or oral communication shall, if requested, authorize the entry of premises or facilities specified under subsection (c)(3) or premises necessary to obtain access to the premises or facilities specified under subsection (c)(3) by law enforcement officers specified under subsection (c)(1) as often as necessary solely for the purposes of installing, maintaining or removing an electronic, mechanical or other device, if all of the following apply: (1) The entry is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes of this subchapter. (2) The judge who issues the order is notified of the time and method of each entry prior to entry within 48 hours of entry. (Oct. 25, 2012, P.L.1634, No.202, eff. 60 days) 2012 Amendment.

      "text": "§ 5713.1. Emergency hostage and barricade situations. (a) Designation.-- The Attorney General or a district attorney may designate supervising law enforcement officers for the purpose of authorizing the interception of wire or oral communications as provided in this section. (b) Procedure.-- A supervising law enforcement officer who reasonably determines that an emergency situation exists that requires a wire or oral communication to be intercepted before an order authorizing such interception can, with due diligence, be obtained, and who determines that there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under this chapter to authorize such interception, may intercept such wire or oral communication. An application for an order approving the interception must be made by the supervising law enforcement officer in accordance with section 5709 (relating to application for order) within 48 hours after the interception has occurred or begins to occur. Interceptions pursuant to this section shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures of this subchapter. Upon request of the supervising law enforcement officer who determines to authorize interceptions of wire communications under this section, a provider of electronic communication service shall provide assistance and be compensated therefor as provided in section 5712(f) (relating to issuance of order and effect). In the absence of an order, such interception shall immediately terminate when the situation giving rise to the hostage or barricade situation ends or when the application for the order is denied, whichever is earlier. In the event such application for approval is denied or in any other case where the interception is terminated without an order having been issued, the contents of any wire or oral communication intercepted shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this subchapter, and an inventory shall be served as provided in section 5716 (relating to service of inventory and inspection of intercepted communications). Thereafter, the supervising law enforcement officer shall follow the procedures set forth in section 5713(b) (relating to emergency situations). (c) Defense.-- A good faith reliance on the provisions of this section shall be a complete defense to any civil or criminal action brought under this subchapter or any other statute against any law enforcement officer or agency conducting any interceptions pursuant to this section as well as a provider of electronic communication service who is required to provide assistance in conducting such interceptions upon request of a supervising law enforcement officer. (d) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Emergency situation.\" Any situation where: (1) a person is holding a hostage and is threatening serious physical injury and may resist with the use of weapons; or (2) a person has barricaded himself and taken a position of confinement to avoid apprehension and: (i) has the ability to resist with the use of weapons; or (ii) is threatening suicide or harm to himself or others. \"Supervising law enforcement officer.\" (1) For designations by a district attorney, any law enforcement officer trained pursuant to section 5724 (relating to training) to carry out interceptions under this section who has attained the rank of lieutenant or higher in a law enforcement agency within the county or who is in charge of a county law enforcement agency. (2) For designations by the Attorney General, any member of the Pennsylvania State Police trained pursuant to section 5724 to carry out interceptions under this section and designated by the Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police who: (i) has attained the rank of lieutenant or higher; or (ii) is in charge of a Pennsylvania State Police barracks.

      "text": "§ 5721.1. Evidentiary disclosure of contents of intercepted communication or derivative evidence. (a) Disclosure in evidence generally.-- (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person shall disclose the contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, in any proceeding in any court, board or agency of this Commonwealth. (2) Any person who has obtained knowledge of the contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, which is properly subject to disclosure under section 5717 (relating to investigative disclosure or use of contents of wire, electronic or oral communications or derivative evidence) may also disclose such contents or evidence in any matter relating to any criminal, quasi-criminal, forfeiture, administrative enforcement or professional disciplinary proceedings in any court, board or agency of this Commonwealth or of another state or of the United States or before any state or Federal grand jury or investigating grand jury. Once such disclosure has been made, then any person may disclose the contents or evidence in any such proceeding. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), no disclosure in any such proceeding shall be made so long as any order excluding such contents or evidence pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) is in effect. (b) Motion to exclude.-- Any aggrieved person who is a party to any proceeding in any court, board or agency of this Commonwealth may move to exclude the contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, on any of the following grounds: (1) Unless intercepted pursuant to an exception set forth in section 5704 (relating to exceptions to prohibition of interception and disclosure of communications), the interception was made without prior procurement of an order of authorization under section 5712 (relating to issuance of order and effect) or an order of approval under section 5713(a) (relating to emergency situations) or 5713.1(b) (relating to emergency hostage and barricade situations). (2) The order of authorization issued under section 5712 or the order of approval issued under section 5713(a) or 5713.1(b) was not supported by probable cause with respect to the matters set forth in section 5710(a)(1) and (2) (relating to grounds for entry of order). (3) The order of authorization issued under section 5712 is materially insufficient on its face. (4) The interception materially deviated from the requirements of the order of authorization. (5) With respect to interceptions pursuant to section 5704(2), the consent to the interception was coerced by the Commonwealth. (6) Where required pursuant to section 5704(2)(iv), the interception was made without prior procurement of a court order or without probable cause. (c) Procedure.-- (1) The motion shall be made in accordance with the applicable rules of procedure governing such proceedings. The court, board or agency, upon the filing of such motion, shall make available to the movant or his counsel the intercepted communication and evidence derived therefrom. (2) In considering a motion to exclude under subsection (b)(2), both the written application under section 5710(a) and all matters that were presented to the judge under section 5710(b) shall be admissible. (3) The movant shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the grounds for exclusion asserted under subsection (b)(3) and (4). (4) With respect to exclusion claims under subsection (b)(1), (2) and (5), the respondent shall bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. (5) With respect to exclusion claims under subsection (b)(6), the movant shall have the initial burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the interception took place in his home. Once he meets this burden, the burden shall shift to the respondent to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the interception was in accordance with section 5704(2)(iv). (6) Evidence shall not be deemed to have been derived from communications excludable under subsection (b) if the respondent can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the Commonwealth or the respondent had a basis independent of the excluded communication for discovering such evidence or that such evidence would have been inevitably discovered by the Commonwealth or the respondent absent the excluded communication. (d) Appeal.-- In addition to any other right of appeal, the Commonwealth shall have the right to appeal from an order granting a motion to exclude if the official to whom the order authorizing the intercept was granted shall certify to the court that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay. The appeal shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of Title 42 (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure). (e) Exclusiveness of remedies and sanctions.-- The remedies and sanctions described in this subchapter with respect to the interception of wire, electronic or oral communications are the only judicial remedies and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this subchapter involving such communications.

If exigent circumstances exist, the court may verbally authorize the disclosure of mobile communications tracking information, the installation and use of a pen register, a trap and trace device or a telecommunication identification interception device. The written order authorizing the disclosure must be entered within 72 hours of the court's verbal authorization. (b) Contents of order.-- An order issued under this section shall: (1) Specify: (i) That there is probable cause to believe that information relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation will be obtained from the targeted telephone.

The purpose of supervision is to assist department-supervised offenders in their rehabilitation and reassimilation into the community and to protect the public. Supervision practices shall reflect the balance of enforcement of the conditions of supervision and case management techniques to maximize successful parole completion through effective reentry to society. (b) Searches and seizures authorized.-- (1) Agents may search the person and property of department-supervised offenders in accordance with the provisions of this section. (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit searches or seizures in violation of the Constitution of the United States or section 8 of Article I of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. (c) Effect of violation.-- No violation of this section shall constitute an independent ground for suppression of evidence in any probation, parole or criminal proceeding. (d) Grounds for personal search of a department-supervised offender.-- (1) A personal search of an offender may be conducted by an agent: (i) if there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that the department-supervised offender possesses contraband or other evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision; (ii) when a department-supervised offender is transported or taken into custody; or (iii) upon a department-supervised offender entering or leaving the secure enclosure of a correctional institution, jail or detention facility. (2) A property search may be conducted by an agent if there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the real or other property in the possession of or under the control of the department-supervised offender contains contraband or other evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision. (3) The department-supervised offender may be detained if the department-supervised offender is present during a property search. If the department-supervised offender is not present during a property search, the agent in charge of the search shall make a reasonable effort to provide the department-supervised offender with notice of the search, including a list of the items seized, after the search is completed. (4) The existence of reasonable suspicion to search shall be determined in accordance with constitutional search and seizure provisions as applied by judicial decision. In accordance with such case law, the following factors, where applicable, may be taken into account: (i) The observations of agents. (ii) Information provided by others. (iii) The activities of the department-supervised offender. (iv) Information provided by the department-supervised offender. (v) The experience of agents with the department-supervised offender. (vi) The experience of agents in similar circumstances. (vii) The prior criminal and supervisory history of the department-supervised offender. (viii) The need to verify compliance with the conditions of supervision. (e) Nonresident department-supervised offenders.-- No agent shall conduct a personal or property search of a department-supervised offender who is residing in a foreign state except for the limited purposes permitted under the Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Offenders and Probationers. The department-supervised offender is held accountable to the rules of both the sending state and the receiving state. Any personal or property search of a department-supervised offender residing in another state shall be conducted by an agent of the receiving state. (f) When authority is effective.-- The authority granted to agents under this section shall be effective upon enactment of this section, without the necessity of any further regulation by the department.",

If the final determination of the Office of Victim Advocate is that the denial of the agency's request for waiver was properly denied, the Office of Victim Advocate shall provide the agency with written notification of this final determination stating that the agency's request has again been denied and setting forth the specific reasons for the denial. If the final determination of the Office of Victim Advocate is that the denial of the agency's request for waiver has been improperly denied, the Office of Victim Advocate shall grant the agency's request for waiver in accordance with this section. The final determination of the Office of Victim Advocate shall be the final order of the Office of Victim Advocate.

The Office of Victim Advocate shall be given notice of any action commenced in accordance with this subsection or general rule and shall be afforded an opportunity to respond as permitted or required by general court rules.

(b) Time for filing petition.-- (1) Any petition under this subchapter, including a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final, unless the petition alleges and the petitioner proves that: (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States; (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively. (2) Any petition invoking an exception provided in paragraph (1) shall be filed within one year of the date the claim could have been presented.
