Any disputes under this subsection shall be resolved by the commission.\n\n(c) Correction of inadequate service.--If the commission, after hearing, determines that the retail electric service being furnished or proposed to be furnished by a retail electric supplier to an electric-consuming facility is inadequate and is not likely to be made adequate, the commission may authorize another retail electric supplier to furnish retail electric service to that facility.\n\n(d) Electric-consuming facilities served by another retail electric supplier.--Except as provided in subsection (c), no retail electric supplier shall furnish, make available, render or extend retail electric service to any electric-consuming facility to which the service is being lawfully furnished by another retail electric supplier on July 30, 1975, or to which retail electric service is lawfully commenced thereafter in accordance with this section by another retail electric supplier.\n\n(e) Extension of service.--The provisions of this subchapter shall not preclude any retail electric supplier from extending its service after July 30, 1975, to its own property and facilities, but any facilities involved in the extension shall not be deemed an existing distribution line.",
