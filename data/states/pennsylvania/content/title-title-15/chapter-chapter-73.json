      "text": "(a) Service within certified territory.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, each retail electric supplier shall be obligated (upon receipt of an application in accordance with its tariffs, rules, regulations or bylaws) and shall have the exclusive right to furnish retail electric service to all electric-consuming facilities located within its certified territory and shall not furnish, make available, render or extend its retail electric service to a consumer for use in electric-consuming facilities located within the certified territory of another retail electric supplier. Any retail electric supplier may extend its facilities through the certified territory of another retail electric supplier if the extension is necessary for the supplier to connect any of its facilities or to serve its consumers within its own certified territory, but any such extension shall not be deemed to be an existing distribution line.\n\n(b) Service to new electric-consuming facilities.--Except as provided in subsections (c) and (e), any new electric-consuming facility located in an unincorporated area which has not as yet been included in a map issued by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission pursuant to section 7354(c) (relating to maps of certified territories) or certified pursuant to section 7354(d) (relating to commission certification of service territories) shall be furnished retail electric service by the retail electric supplier which has an existing distribution line in closer proximity to the electric-consuming facility than is the nearest existing distribution line of any other retail electric supplier. Any disputes under this subsection shall be resolved by the commission.\n\n(c) Correction of inadequate service.--If the commission, after hearing, determines that the retail electric service being furnished or proposed to be furnished by a retail electric supplier to an electric-consuming facility is inadequate and is not likely to be made adequate, the commission may authorize another retail electric supplier to furnish retail electric service to that facility.\n\n(d) Electric-consuming facilities served by another retail electric supplier.--Except as provided in subsection (c), no retail electric supplier shall furnish, make available, render or extend retail electric service to any electric-consuming facility to which the service is being lawfully furnished by another retail electric supplier on July 30, 1975, or to which retail electric service is lawfully commenced thereafter in accordance with this section by another retail electric supplier.\n\n(e) Extension of service.--The provisions of this subchapter shall not preclude any retail electric supplier from extending its service after July 30, 1975, to its own property and facilities, but any facilities involved in the extension shall not be deemed an existing distribution line.",
