The corporation shall be made a party defendant in the action and shall, at its expense, give notice of the commencement of the action to all shareholders and to such other persons as the court may direct. The court shall proceed to determine the fair value of the shares considering the going concern value of the corporation, any agreement among some or all of the shareholders fixing a price or specifying a formula for determining the value of shares of the corporation for any purpose, the recommendations of any appraiser appointed by the court, any legal constraint on the ability of the corporation to acquire the shares and other relevant evidence. The court shall enter an order requiring the corporation to cause the purchase of the shares at fair value including such provisions as are deemed proper concerning payment of the purchase price in two or more installments, payment of interest on the installments, subordination of the obligation to the rights of other creditors of the corporation and security for payment of the deferred purchase price.\n\n(g) Costs and expenses.--Except as otherwise prescribed by general rules:\n\n(1) If the fair value of the shares as determined by the court does not materially exceed the last offer made by the corporation prior to the commencement of an action pursuant to subsection (f) and the court finds that the failure of the personal representative to accept the last offer of the corporation was dilatory, arbitrary, obdurate, vexatious or in bad faith, the court may assess all or a portion of the costs and expenses of the action against the estate of the deceased shareholder.\n\n(2) If the fair value of the shares as determined by the court materially exceeds the amount of the last offer made by the corporation prior to the time an action or proceeding was commenced pursuant to subsection (f) and the court finds that the last offer of the corporation was dilatory, arbitrary, obdurate, vexatious or in bad faith, the court may assess all or a portion of the costs and expenses of the action against the corporation.\n\n(3) Expenses assessable under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall include reasonable compensation for and reasonable expenses of any appraiser appointed by the court and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for and experts employed by any party.\n\n(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2), the costs of an action commenced pursuant to subsection (f) shall be assessed on an equal basis between the corporation and the estate of the deceased shareholder and all other fees and expenses shall be borne by the party incurring the fees and expenses.\n\n(h) Subsequent modification of order.--Upon application of the corporation, the court may modify its order to change the terms of payment if it finds that the changed financial or legal ability of the corporation or other purchasers of the shares to complete the purchase justifies a modification. Any person making a payment in order to prevent or cure any default by any purchaser shall be entitled to recover the excess payment from the defaulting person.\n\n(i) Failure to make payment.--If the corporation or other purchaser fails for any reason to make any payment specified in the order within 30 days after the due date for the payment, the court shall, upon application of the person to whom the payment is due and in the absence of good cause shown by the corporation, enter an order directing that the corporation be dissolved.\n\n(j) Waiver.--Any shareholder may waive in writing the rights of his personal representative under this section.\n\n(k) Section nonexclusive.--This section shall not be construed to prohibit any other agreement not prohibited by law that provides for the purchase of shares of the corporation nor shall it prevent a shareholder from enforcing any other remedy he may have.\n\nCross References.Section 2325 is referred to in sections 1504, 1571, 2301 of this title.",
