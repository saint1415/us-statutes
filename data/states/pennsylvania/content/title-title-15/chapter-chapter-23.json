      "text": "(a) General rule.--Unless otherwise provided in a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, the personal representative of any deceased holder or owner of shares shall have the right to require a statutory close corporation to elect either to purchase or cause the purchase of all, but not less than all, of the shares owned by the decedent pursuant to subsections (c) through (e) or to be dissolved.\n\n(b) Minimum vote requirement.--An amendment to the bylaws to provide that this section shall apply or to delete or modify the provisions of this section shall require at least the minimum vote for approval. Any shareholder who votes against an amendment to delete or modify the provisions of this section shall, if the amendment terminates or substantially alters the existing rights of the shareholder pursuant to this section to have his shares purchased, be entitled to receive the fair value of his shares upon compliance with the provisions of Subchapter D of Chapter 15 (relating to dissenters rights).\n\n(c) Initial procedure.--Within six months after the death of the holder or owner of shares, the personal representative shall deliver a written notice to the corporation at its registered office specifying the number and class of all shares beneficially owned by the deceased shareholder and stating that an offer by the corporation to purchase the shares is being solicited pursuant to this section. Within 20 days after receipt of the notice by the corporation, the secretary shall call a special meeting of shareholders, which shall be held not more than 40 days after the call, for the purpose of determining whether to offer to purchase the shares. Approval of action to offer to purchase the shares shall be by vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, excluding the shares covered by the notice. With the consent of all the shareholders entitled to vote for the approval, the corporation may allocate some or all of the shares to one or more shareholders, or to other persons, but if the corporation has more than one class of shares, the remaining holders of the class of shares being offered for sale shall have a first option to purchase the shares that are not purchased by the corporation in proportion to their shareholdings or in such proportion as shall be agreeable to those desiring to participate in the purchase.\n\n(d) Notice of action by corporation.--Written notice of the approval by the shareholders of an offer to purchase, or that no offer to purchase was approved, shall be delivered or sent to the personal representative within 75 days after receipt of the notice soliciting the offer to purchase. Any offer to purchase shall be accompanied by copies of the balance sheets as of the end of, and profit and loss statements for, the preceding two fiscal years of the corporation and any available interim balance sheet and profit and loss statement. Any offer to purchase shall be accepted or rejected in writing within 15 days.\n\n(e) Price and other terms of purchase.--To the extent the price and other terms for purchasing the shares by the corporation or remaining shareholders are fixed or are to be determined pursuant to provisions in the bylaws or in a written agreement, those provisions shall be binding except that, in the event of a default in any payment due, subsection (i) shall apply and the person exercising his rights under this section shall have the right to petition for dissolution of the corporation.\n\n(f) Judicial proceedings in absence of agreement to purchase.--If an offer to purchase is rejected, or if an offer to purchase is not made under this section, the personal representative may commence an action or proceeding in court under this subsection. The jurisdiction of the court shall be plenary and exclusive. The corporation shall be made a party defendant in the action and shall, at its expense, give notice of the commencement of the action to all shareholders and to such other persons as the court may direct. The court shall proceed to determine the fair value of the shares considering the going concern value of the corporation, any agreement among some or all of the shareholders fixing a price or specifying a formula for determining the value of shares of the corporation for any purpose, the recommendations of any appraiser appointed by the court, any legal constraint on the ability of the corporation to acquire the shares and other relevant evidence. The court shall enter an order requiring the corporation to cause the purchase of the shares at fair value including such provisions as are deemed proper concerning payment of the purchase price in two or more installments, payment of interest on the installments, subordination of the obligation to the rights of other creditors of the corporation and security for payment of the deferred purchase price.\n\n(g) Costs and expenses.--Except as otherwise prescribed by general rules:\n\n(1) If the fair value of the shares as determined by the court does not materially exceed the last offer made by the corporation prior to the commencement of an action pursuant to subsection (f) and the court finds that the failure of the personal representative to accept the last offer of the corporation was dilatory, arbitrary, obdurate, vexatious or in bad faith, the court may assess all or a portion of the costs and expenses of the action against the estate of the deceased shareholder.\n\n(2) If the fair value of the shares as determined by the court materially exceeds the amount of the last offer made by the corporation prior to the time an action or proceeding was commenced pursuant to subsection (f) and the court finds that the last offer of the corporation was dilatory, arbitrary, obdurate, vexatious or in bad faith, the court may assess all or a portion of the costs and expenses of the action against the corporation.\n\n(3) Expenses assessable under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall include reasonable compensation for and reasonable expenses of any appraiser appointed by the court and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for and experts employed by any party.\n\n(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2), the costs of an action commenced pursuant to subsection (f) shall be assessed on an equal basis between the corporation and the estate of the deceased shareholder and all other fees and expenses shall be borne by the party incurring the fees and expenses.\n\n(h) Subsequent modification of order.--Upon application of the corporation, the court may modify its order to change the terms of payment if it finds that the changed financial or legal ability of the corporation or other purchasers of the shares to complete the purchase justifies a modification. Any person making a payment in order to prevent or cure any default by any purchaser shall be entitled to recover the excess payment from the defaulting person.\n\n(i) Failure to make payment.--If the corporation or other purchaser fails for any reason to make any payment specified in the order within 30 days after the due date for the payment, the court shall, upon application of the person to whom the payment is due and in the absence of good cause shown by the corporation, enter an order directing that the corporation be dissolved.\n\n(j) Waiver.--Any shareholder may waive in writing the rights of his personal representative under this section.\n\n(k) Section nonexclusive.--This section shall not be construed to prohibit any other agreement not prohibited by law that provides for the purchase of shares of the corporation nor shall it prevent a shareholder from enforcing any other remedy he may have.\n\nCross References.Section 2325 is referred to in sections 1504, 1571, 2301 of this title.",
