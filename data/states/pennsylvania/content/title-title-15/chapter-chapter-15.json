The application shall be accompanied by the bond and a certified copy of the resolution of condemnation. The resolution shall describe the nature and extent of the taking.\n\n(ii) If the address of such interested party is known to the corporation, written notice of the filing of the application under subparagraph (i) shall be sent to such party by mail, or otherwise, at least ten days prior to the consideration thereof by the court.
