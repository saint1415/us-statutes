The court shall summarily order the corporation to permit the requested inspection or to obtain the information unless the corporation establishes that information other than the bylaws to be obtained by the exercise of the right is not reasonably related to the performance of the duties of the director or that the director or the attorney or agent of the director is likely to use that information in a manner that would violate the duty of the director to the corporation. The order of the court may contain provisions protecting the corporation from undue burden or expense and prohibiting the director from using the information in a manner that would violate the duty of the director to the corporation.\n\n(c) Right to bylaws.--Every director has the right to receive, on demand and without charge, a copy in record form of the currently effective text of the bylaws.
