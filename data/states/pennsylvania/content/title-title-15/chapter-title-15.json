The tax shall be increased by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective January 1, 1985, and by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective July 1, 1985. Distributors shall be liable to the Commonwealth for the collection and payment of the tax imposed by this section. The tax shall be collected by the distributor and shall be paid to the Commonwealth only once with respect to any fuels. (b) Annual adjustment.-- Beginning on January 1, 1986, and each January 1 thereafter, the tax imposed under this section shall be adjusted annually and shall be set for that calendar year. The adjustment shall be based upon the percentage change of the Producer Price Index for Jet Fuel, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States Department of Labor, for the most recent 12-month period available as of the immediately preceding November 1. For every 10% increase or decrease in the Producer Price Index, as determined by comparing the index for the first month of the 12-month period with the index for the last month of the period, there shall be a 0.1¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, increase or decrease in the rate of tax. The rate of tax shall be determined by the Secretary of Revenue, who shall cause such rate to be published as a notice pursuant to 45 Pa.C.S. § 725(a)(3) (relating to additional contents of Pennsylvania Bulletin) in the Pennsylvania Bulletin on or before December 15 of each year. The tax, as adjusted, shall never exceed 2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, nor shall it be less than 1.5¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof. (c) Construction of section.-- This section shall be construed in conjunction with the act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, as if jet fuels were liquid fuels as defined in that act, and all of the provisions of that act, except for section 4 thereof to the extent it imposes any tax, shall apply to the collection, administration and enforcement of the tax imposed under this section. Upon the effective date of the tax imposed by this section upon jet fuels, such jet fuels shall not be subject to the tax imposed by the act of January 14, 1952 (1951 P.L.1965, No.550), known as the Fuel Use Tax Act, except that dealer-users shall remain liable to report and pay the fuel use tax on any jet fuels used thereafter upon which the tax provided by this section has not been imposed. (d) Disposition of taxes.-- All moneys collected under this section shall be deposited by the State Treasurer in the Aviation Restricted Account. Effective Date of Tax. Section 4 of Act 164 of 1984 provided that, if Act 164 was not finally enacted on or before July 1, 1984, the tax imposed under section 6131 shall not be effective as of July 1, 1984, but shall be effective on the first day of the first month following final enactment (November 1, 1984). References in Text. The act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, referred to in subsec. (c), was repealed by the act of April 17, 1997 (P.L.6, No.3).

(a) General rule.-- (1) The bonds of the authority shall be authorized by resolution of the board thereof and shall be of such series, bear such date or dates, bear or accrue interest at such rate or rates, fixed or variable, as shall be determined by the board as necessary to issue and sell the authorized bonds, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or fully registered without coupons, be in certificated or book-entry-only form, carry such registration and exchangeability and interchangeability privileges, be payable in such medium of payment and at such place or places, be subject to such terms of redemption and be entitled to such priorities of payment in the revenues or receipts of the authority as the resolution or trust indenture adopted or approved by the authority may provide. (2) The bonds shall be signed by or shall bear the facsimile signatures of such officers as the board shall determine, and coupon bonds shall have attached thereto interest coupons bearing the facsimile signature of the treasurer of the authority, and all bonds shall be authenticated by an authenticating agent, fiscal agent or trustee, all as may be prescribed in the resolution or trust indenture. (3) Any such bonds may be issued and delivered notwithstanding that one or more of the officers signing bonds or the treasurer whose facsimile signature shall be upon the coupon, or any thereof, shall have ceased to be an officer or officers at the time when the bonds shall actually be delivered. (4) The proceeds of an issue of bonds may be used to pay the costs of a project; subject to the limitations of subsection (b), to finance any cash flow deficit of the authority; to reimburse any costs of a project initially paid by the authority or any person; to fund any required reserves; to capitalize interest; or to pay costs of issuance, including, but not limited to, costs of obtaining credit enhancement for the bonds. (b) Maturity.-- Bonds issued to finance the costs of a project shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their respective dates of original issue as the authority shall by resolution determine. Bonds issued in anticipation of income of the authority shall mature within one fiscal year after the fiscal year of the date of issuance thereof, except for bonds issued in anticipation of grants with respect to the cost of a project, which bonds shall mature no later than six months beyond the time of anticipated receipt of the final payment of the grant. (c) Sale.-- Bonds may be sold at public sale or invited sale for such price or prices and at such rate or rates of interest as the authority shall determine. Bonds may be sold at private sale by negotiation at such price or prices and at such rate or rates of interest as the authority shall determine, but only if the authority makes a written public explanation of the circumstances and justification for the private sale by negotiation. Pending the preparation of the definitive bonds, interim receipts may be issued to the purchaser or purchasers of such bonds and may contain such terms and conditions as the authority may determine. (d) Negotiable instruments.-- Bonds of an authority shall have the qualities of negotiable instruments under Title 13 (relating to commercial code). (e) Refunding.-- (1) Subject to the provisions of the outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations issued under this chapter or prior acts and subject to the provisions of this chapter, the authority shall have the right and power to refund any outstanding debt, whether the debt represents principal or interest, in whole or in part, at any time. (2) As used in this subsection, \"refund\" and its variations shall mean the issuance and sale of obligations the proceeds of which are used or are to be used for the payment or redemption of outstanding obligations upon or prior to maturity. Refunding bonds shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their dates of original issuance as the authority shall determine by resolution. (f) Credit of Commonwealth and political subdivisions not pledged.-- Under no circumstances shall any bonds issued by the authority or any other obligation of the authority be or become an indebtedness or liability of the Commonwealth or of any government agency, provided that any government agency may guarantee bonds of an authority to the extent and for the purposes for which the government agency may make loans or grants to an authority. (g) Nonliability.-- Neither the board members, any employees of the authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on any bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. Bonds of an authority shall contain a statement of the limitation set forth in this subsection. (h) Bonds deemed valid.-- Any bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the authority to accomplish the public purposes of this subchapter shall be conclusively deemed in any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of the bonds or security therefor to have been issued for such purpose. (i) Notice and challenges.-- (1) The authority may cause a copy of any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds adopted by it to be filed for public inspection in its office and in the office of the clerk of the governing body of each county and the governing body of the city of the first class within its service area and may thereupon cause to be published in a newspaper published or circulating in its service area a notice stating the fact and date of the adoption, the places where the resolution has been so filed for public inspection, the date of publication of the notice and that any action or proceeding of any kind or nature in any court questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the resolution, or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contract provided for by such resolution, shall be commenced within 20 days after the publication of the notice. (2) If any notice shall at any time be published and if no action or proceeding questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the resolution or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contract provided for by such resolution shall be commenced within 20 days after the publication of the notice, then all residents, taxpayers and owners of property in the service area and users of the transportation system of the authority and all other persons whatsoever shall be forever barred and foreclosed from instituting or commencing any action or proceeding in any court or pleading any defense to any action or proceedings questioning the validity or proper authorization of such bonds or the validity of any such covenants, agreements or contracts, and said bonds, covenants, agreements and contracts shall be conclusively deemed to be valid and binding obligations in accordance with their terms and tenor. (3) After issuance of bonds, all bonds shall be conclusively presumed to be fully authorized and issued by all the laws of this Commonwealth, and any person shall be estopped from questioning their sale, execution or delivery by the authority.",

(b) Duties at stop signs.-- Except when directed to proceed by a police officer or appropriately attired persons authorized to direct, control or regulate traffic, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if no stop line is present, before entering a crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if no crosswalk is present, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a clear view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering. If, after stopping at a crosswalk or clearly marked stop line, a driver does not have a clear view of approaching traffic, the driver shall after yielding the right-of-way to any pedestrian in the crosswalk slowly pull forward from the stopped position to a point where the driver has a clear view of approaching traffic. The driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute a hazard during the time when the driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways and enter the intersection when it is safe to do so. (c) Duties at yield signs.-- The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall in obedience to the sign slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and, if required for safety to stop, shall stop before entering a crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering. After slowing down or stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute a hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the intersection of roadways. If a driver is involved in a collision with a vehicle in the intersection or junction of roadways after driving past a yield sign, the collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of failure of the driver to yield the right-of-way.

(b) Legislative findings.-- It is hereby determined by the General Assembly to reaffirm the legislative findings contained in the act of November 28, 1986 (P.L.1465, No.146), known as the Reciprocal Limitations Act, and codified in this section: (1) The award of contracts to the lowest responsible bidder generally provides for the most economical procurement of supplies and construction. (2) In some cases, award to the lowest responsible bidder may not be the most economical and practicable when the best interests of the Commonwealth are concerned. (3) Some states apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or they apply a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders. (4) The application of this preference or prohibition by other states diminishes or eliminates opportunities for bidders and manufacturers who reside in this Commonwealth to obtain construction contracts from or to sell supplies to states that have this preference, thereby resulting in the loss of business for resident bidders and manufacturers. Therefore, in order to offset or counteract the discriminatory practices of other states, discourage other states from applying a preference and ultimately to aid employment, help business and industry located in this Commonwealth, attract new business and industry to this Commonwealth and provide additional tax revenue both from those receiving contracts and those employed by contractors, the General Assembly hereby declares that it is the policy of this Commonwealth to respond in like manner against those states that apply preferences or prohibitions by giving a similar offsetting preference to residents in this Commonwealth and bidders offering supplies manufactured in this Commonwealth and by prohibiting the purchase or use of certain supplies, in accordance with the provisions of this section. (c) Preference for supplies.-- In all procurements of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 (relating to small procurements), all Commonwealth agencies shall give preference to those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in this Commonwealth as against those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that gives or requires a preference to supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the other state for that particular supply. (d) Preference for resident bidders or offerors.-- When a contract for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 is to be awarded, a resident bidder or offeror shall be granted a preference as against a nonresident bidder or offeror from any state that gives or requires a preference to bidders or offerors from that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the state of the nonresident bidder or offeror. (e) Prohibition.-- For all contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, no Commonwealth agency shall specify for, use or procure any supplies which are produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that prohibits the specification for, use or procurement of these supplies in or on its public buildings or other works when these supplies are not produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. (f) Listing discriminating states.-- The department shall prepare a list of the states which apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or offerors or a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders or offerors and shall publish the list in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. When a state applies a new preference or prohibition, the department shall publish that information in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as an addition to the original list. (g) Inclusion in invitation for bids or request for proposals.-- In all invitations for bids and requests for proposals for the procurement of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, all Commonwealth agencies shall include a list of all the states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference favoring in-state supplies, bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 shall include a list of all states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference for in-state bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the purchasing agency for small procurements under section 514 shall also include a list of all states that apply a prohibition against certain supplies and shall inform potential bidders or offerors that they are prohibited from using supplies from those states. If a bid or proposal discloses that the bidder or offeror is offering supplies from a state which prohibits the use of out-of-state supplies, the bid or proposal shall be rejected. (h) Federal funds.-- The provisions of this section shall not be applicable when the application of this section may jeopardize the receipt of Federal funds. (i) Waiver.-- The provisions of this section may be waived when the head of the purchasing agency determines in writing that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth. (j) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Resident bidder or offeror.\" A person, partnership, corporation or other business entity authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth and having a bona fide establishment for transacting business in this Commonwealth at which it was transacting business on the date when bids or proposals for the public contract were first solicited.

(b) Notice to interest holders.-- If the ratification of the defective entity action requires action by the interest holders under section 223(c), and if the action is to be taken at a meeting, the entity must give notice to each holder of interests, regardless of whether entitled to vote, as of the record date for notice of the meeting and as of the date of the occurrence of the defective entity action. If the ratification relates to an overissue, the entity must give notice to the holders of both valid and putative interests.

The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider ratification of a defective entity action and must be accompanied by: (1) either a copy of the action taken by the governors in accordance with section 223 or the information required by section 223(a)(1), (2), (3) and (4); and (2) a statement that any claim that the ratification of the defective entity action and any putative interests issued as a result of the defective entity action should not be effective, or should be effective only on certain conditions, must be brought within 120 days after the applicable validation effective time.

(d) Election of governors.-- Action by interest holders ratifying the election of governors requires either: (1) that the votes cast within the voting group favoring ratification exceed the votes cast opposing ratification of the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present; or (2) in the case of directors or a class of directors of a business corporation elected by cumulative voting, that the votes cast against ratification not be sufficient to elect one or more directors to the board or to the class. (e) Putative interests.-- The following apply to putative interests: (1) Putative interests on the record date for determining the interest holders entitled to vote on any matter submitted to interest holders under section 223(c) shall be entitled to vote and shall be counted for quorum purposes in any vote to approve the ratification of the matter if: (i) they are shares of a registered corporation described in section 2502(1) (relating to registered corporation status); and (ii) they have been held of record in fungible bulk by a registered clearing agency or its nominee, acting as securities intermediary. (2) In all other cases, putative interests on the record date for determining the interest holders entitled to vote on any matter submitted to interest holders under section 223(c), and without giving effect to any ratification of putative interests that becomes effective as a result of the vote, are not entitled to vote and do not count for quorum purposes in any vote to approve the ratification of a defective entity action. (f) Required amendment.-- If the approval under this section of putative interests would result in an overissue, in addition to the approval required by section 223, approval of an amendment to the organic rules of the entity to increase the number of interests of an authorized class or series or to authorize the creation of a class or series of interests so there will be no over issue is also required.

(b) Bar on voiding certain overissues.-- Subject to subsection (d), after the expiration of the applicable period set forth in subsection (c): (1) an overissue is not void or voidable on the basis of having been in excess of the number of interests of the class or series that the domestic entity had the power to issue or on the basis of the entity's lack of authority to issue interests of the class or series, and is a valid entity action effective as of the date of the overissue; (2) the putative interests are duly authorized and validly issued valid interests; (3) any entity action taken subsequent to the overissue in reliance on the overissue having been validly effected is valid as of the time taken; and (4) any subsequent defective entity action resulting directly or indirectly from the original overissue is duly authorized and valid as of the time taken, if the failure of authorization of the subsequent defective entity action relates solely to the defective entity action referred to in paragraph (1). (c) Applicable period.-- The applicable period under this section shall be the shortest of: (1) in the case of a defective entity action taken by a registered corporation, two years from the date when the registered corporation, or any successor or any person directly or indirectly owning all the shares of the registered corporation or of any successor to the registered corporation, has disclosed the defective entity action in a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission; (2) six years from the date when: (i) the defective entity action is set forth in or implemented or purported to be implemented through the public organic record of the entity taking the action; or (ii) disclosure in record form of the occurrence of the defective entity action is received by the person or persons whose authorization would have been necessary for the entity action not to have been defective; or (iii) in the case of an overissue of shares of a business corporation, disclosure in record form is given to all shareholders in the manner set forth in section 1702 (relating to manner of giving notice) of the fact of the issuance of the putative interests or of the existence of the putative interests resulting from the overissue; and (3) 21 years after the defective entity action. (d) Application to court to void defective entity action.-- To the extent that relief is available under other applicable law, a person entitled to assert under applicable law that a defective entity action is void or voidable may, before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in this section, file an action for relief declaring or otherwise establishing that the defective entity action is void or voidable. If such an action is filed, the operation of subsection (a) or (b) shall be suspended until the final resolution of the action, and, to the extent that relief is obtained, subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply. (e) Other relief not affected.-- The operation of subsections (a) and (b) and the time periods set forth in subsection (c) do not affect the availability of relief under applicable law other than this subchapter relating to a defective entity action not predicated on: (1) a failure of authorization under this title relating thereto; (2) a lack of power or authority under section 1521 (relating to authorized shares) or the organic rules resulting in an overissue; or (3) the asserted void or voidable status of the defective entity action. (f) No tolling.-- The operation of subsection (c) is not tolled by reason of any person's unawareness of the failure of authorization of the defective entity action or other grounds, other than, in the case of subsection (c)(1) and (2), active and deliberate fraud, concealment or forgery proven by clear and convincing evidence. (g) Presumptions.-- For purposes of this section, the governors and interest holders of the entity are deemed to have acted in reliance on the defective entity action in authorizing subsequent entity actions unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrates a lack of such reliance. For purposes of subsection (c)(2)(ii) and (iii), a contemporaneous record in record form of the giving of disclosure by a governor, officer or agent of the entity is presumptive evidence of the giving and receipt of such disclosure. (h) Amendment of organic rules following overissue.-- After the expiration of the applicable period applicable to an overissue, the domestic entity may, and within a reasonable period after a request in record form of a holder of formerly putative interests resulting from an overissue must, adopt an amendment to its organic rules: (1) increasing the number of interests of the class or series that includes the formerly putative interests to the minimum number necessary for the entity's organic rules to set forth the power of the entity to have issued the total number of issued interests of the class or series held by all interest holders; or (2) otherwise amending its organic rules to the extent necessary to authorize the creation and issuance of the class or series of formerly putative interests. (i) Effectiveness of section.-- In the case of a defective entity action occurring before January 3, 2023: (1) the operation of subsections (a) and (b) is suspended until January 3, 2024, notwithstanding any expiration of the applicable period set forth in subsection (c); (2) despite any expiration of the applicable period set forth in subsection (c), a person entitled to assert under applicable law that a defective entity action is void or voidable may file an action under subsection (d) if the action is filed on or before January 3, 2024; (3) any action pending on January 3, 2023, seeking relief on the grounds that a defective entity action is void or voidable, including any relief that may be obtained in the action, is not affected by this section; (4) any final judgment relating to the defective entity action that had become no longer subject to appeal before January 3, 2023, is not affected by this section; and (5) this section shall otherwise apply with full retroactive effect to a defective entity action.

The contractor shall also require the subcontractor to make similar payments to his subcontractors. (7) The department shall have the right to engage the services of any architect or consulting or supervising engineer or engineers whom it may deem necessary for the proper designing of or inspection or supervision of projects constructed, altered or enlarged by the department under this section in accordance with the selection procedures of section 905. (8) Changes in scope in the plans or specifications, or both, may be made after their approval only with the consent of the Governor and all of the Commonwealth agencies and State-related institutions whose approval of the original plans or specifications, or both, was necessary under this section.

(a) General rule.-- The commission may, on its own motion and whenever it may be necessary in the performance of its duties, investigate and examine the condition and management of any public utility or any other person or corporation subject to this part. In conducting the investigations the commission may proceed, either with or without a hearing, as it may deem best, but it shall make no order without affording the parties affected thereby a hearing. Any investigation, inquiry or hearing which the commission has power to undertake or hold shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. (b) Assignment of proceedings; powers of chairman.-- All on-the-record proceedings shall be referred to an administrative law judge for decision except that in those proceedings involving a rate determination, safety matters, rulemaking procedures, unprotested applications or matters covered by section 335(a)(1) (relating to initial decisions), the commission may authorize the chairman to assign cases as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3); and, in addition, the commission may authorize the chairman to: (1) Designate the time and place for the conducting of investigations, inquiries and hearings. (2) Assign cases to a commissioner or commissioners for hearing, investigation, inquiry, study or other similar purposes. (3) Assign cases to special agents or administrative law judges for the taking and receiving of evidence. (4) Direct and designate officers and employees of the commission to make investigations, inspections, inquiries, studies and other like assignments for reports to the commission. (5) Be responsible through the secretary for specifically enumerated daily administrative operations of the commission. (c) Requirements for presiding officers.-- There shall preside at the taking of evidence the commission, one or more commissioners, or one or more administrative law judges appointed as provided in this chapter. The functions of all presiding officers shall be conducted in an impartial manner. Any such officer may at any time withdraw from a proceeding if he deems himself disqualified, and, upon the filing in good faith of a timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of any such officer, the commission shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the proceeding. (d) Authority of presiding officers.-- In addition to any administrative rules of procedure contained in this part, the commission may adopt and publish such additional rules of procedure as are not inconsistent with this part. Officers presiding at hearings shall have authority subject to the published rules of the commission and within its powers, to: (1) Administer oaths and affirmations. (2) Issue subpoenas authorized by law. (3) Rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence, take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of justice would be served thereby. (4) Regulate the course of the hearing. (5) Require persons requesting to make a statement at a public input hearing to state their name, occupation and place of employment for the record. (6) Hold conferences for settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties. (7) Dispose of procedural requests or similar matters. (8) Make decisions or recommend decisions in conformity within this part. (9) Take any other action authorized by commission rule. (e) Interlocutory appeals.-- A presiding officer may certify to the commission, or allow the parties an interlocutory appeal to the commission on any material question arising in the course of a proceeding, where he finds that it is necessary to do so to prevent substantial prejudice to any party or to expedite the conduct of the proceeding. The presiding officer or the commission may thereafter stay the proceeding if necessary to protect the substantial rights of any of the parties therein. The commission shall determine the question forthwith and the hearing and further decision shall thereafter be governed accordingly. No interlocutory appeal to the commission shall otherwise be allowed, except as may be allowed by the commission. (f) Declaratory orders.-- The commission, with like effect as in the case of other orders, and in its sound discretion, may issue a declaratory order to terminate a controversy or remove uncertainty. (g) Official notice defined.-- As used in this chapter the term \"official notice\" means a method by which the commission may notify all parties that no further evidence will be heard on a material fact and that unless the parties prove to the contrary, the commission's findings will include that particular fact.

(a) Burden of proof.-- Except as may be otherwise provided in section 315 (relating to burden of proof) or other provisions of this part or other relevant statute, the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof. (b) Admissibility of evidence.-- Any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the commission shall as a matter of policy provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. No sanction shall be imposed or rule or order be issued except upon consideration of the whole record or such portions thereof as may be cited by any party and as supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative and substantial evidence. (c) Submission of evidence.-- Every party is entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The commission may, by rule, adopt procedures for the submission of all or part of the evidence in written form. (d) Record, briefs and argument.-- The transcript of a public input hearing, the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, constitutes the exclusive record for decision, and shall be available for inspection by the public. Briefing and oral argument shall be held in accordance with rules established by the commission. For the purpose of this section, a public input hearing is a hearing held in the service area at which the ratepayers may offer testimony, written or otherwise, relating to any matter which has a bearing on the proceeding. (e) Official notice of facts.-- When the commission's decision rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, upon notification that facts are about to be or have been noticed, any party adversely affected shall have the opportunity upon timely request to show that the facts are not properly noticed or that alternative facts should be noticed. The commission in its discretion shall determine whether written presentations suffice, or whether oral argument, oral evidence, or cross-examination is appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the application by the commission in appropriate circumstances of the doctrine of judicial notice. (f) Actions of parties and counsel.-- Any party who shall fail to be represented at a scheduled conference or hearing after being duly notified thereof, shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to participate in such conference or hearing, and shall not be permitted thereafter to reopen the disposition of any matter accomplished thereat, or to recall for further examination of witnesses who were excused, unless the presiding officer shall determine that failure to be represented was unavoidable and that the interests of the other parties and the public would not be prejudiced by permitting such reopening or further examination. If the actions of a party or counsel in a proceeding shall be determined by the commission, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, to be obstructive to the orderly conduct of the proceeding and inimical to the public interest, the commission may reject or dismiss any rule or order in any manner proposed by the offending party or counsel, and, with respect to counsel, may bar further participation by him in any proceedings before the commission. (g) Decision of administrative law judge.-- In all on-the-record proceedings referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) (relating to powers of commission and administrative law judges), hearings shall be commenced by the administrative law judge within 90 days after the proceeding is initiated, and he shall render a decision within 90 days after the record is closed, unless the commission for good cause by order allows an extension not to exceed an additional 90 days. (h) Exceptions and appeal procedure.-- Any party to a proceeding referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) may file exceptions to the decision of the administrative law judge with the commission, in a form and manner and within the time to be prescribed by the commission. The commission shall rule upon such exceptions within 90 days after filing. If no exceptions are filed, the decision shall become final, without further commission action, unless two or more commissioners within 15 days after the decision request that the commission review the decision and make such other order, within 90 days of such request, as it shall determine. The Office of Trial Staff and the chief counsel shall be deemed to have automatic standing as a party to such proceeding and may file exceptions to any decision of the administrative law judge under this subsection. (i) Review of testimony.-- Any party of record in an investigation or inquiry by or hearing before the commission or its representative whose testimony is recorded electronically and subsequently transcribed shall, upon request, be permitted to review the recording to ensure that it has been transcribed accurately. The commission may impose a fee in an amount not exceeding the actual costs involved for making the recording available. Any request to review the recording must be made within the time prescribed by commission regulation, and such request shall not be used to unreasonably delay commission proceedings. This section shall not be construed to require the electronic recording of testimony. The official record of a proceeding shall be the written transcript.

(a) Conferences.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority to hold one or more prehearing conferences during the course of the proceeding on his own motion or at the request of a party to the proceeding. The presiding officer shall normally hold at least one prehearing conference in proceedings where the issues are complex or where it appears likely that the hearing will last a considerable period of time. In addition to other matters which the commission may prescribe by rule, the presiding officer at a prehearing conference may direct the parties to exchange their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists prior to the hearing. Where good cause exists, the parties may at any time amend, by deletion or supplementation, their evidentiary exhibits and witness lists. (b) Depositions.-- A party to the proceeding shall be able to take depositions of witnesses upon oral examination or written questions for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information, subject to the following conditions: (1) The taking of depositions shall normally be deferred until there has been at least one prehearing conference. (2) The party seeking to take a deposition shall apply to the presiding officer for an order to do so. (3) The party seeking to take a deposition shall serve copies of the application on the other party or parties to the proceedings, who shall be given an opportunity, along with the deponent, to notify the presiding officer of any objections to the taking of the deposition. (4) The presiding officer shall not grant an application to take a deposition if he finds that the taking of the deposition would result in undue delay. (5) The presiding officer shall otherwise grant an application to take a deposition unless he finds that there is not good cause for doing so. (6) The deposing of a commission employee shall only be allowed upon an order of the presiding officer based on a specific finding that the party applying to take the deposition is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. Any such order shall be subject to an interlocutory appeal to the commission. (7) An order to take a deposition shall be enforceable through the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum. (c) Disclosure of information on witnesses.-- At the prehearing conference or at some other reasonable time prior to the hearing, which may be established by commission rule, each party to the proceeding shall make available to the other parties to the proceeding the names of the witnesses he expects to call and the subject matter of their expected testimony. Where good cause exists, the parties shall have the right at any time to amend, by deletion or supplementation, the list of names of the witnesses they plan to call and the subject matter of the expected testimony of those witnesses. (d) Interrogatories.-- Any party to a proceeding may serve written interrogatories upon any other party for purposes of discovering relevant, unprivileged information. A party served with interrogatories may, before the time prescribed either by commission rule or otherwise for answering the interrogatories, apply to the presiding officer for the holding of a prehearing conference for the mutual exchange of evidence exhibits and other information. Each interrogatory which requests information not previously supplied at a prehearing conference or hearing shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for the objections shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections within a reasonable time, unless otherwise specified, upon the party submitting the interrogatories. The party submitting the interrogatories may petition the presiding officer for an order compelling an answer to an interrogatory or interrogatories to which there has been an objection or other failure to answer. The commission shall designate an appropriate official, other than the Director of Trial Staff or any other employee of the Office of Trial Staff, on whom other parties to the proceeding may serve written interrogatories directed to the commission. That official shall arrange for agency personnel with knowledge of the facts to answer and sign the interrogatories on behalf of the commission. Interrogatories directed to the commission shall be allowed only upon an order of the commission based upon a specific finding that the interrogating party is seeking significant, unprivileged information not discoverable by alternative means. When participating in a commission proceeding, the Office of Trial Staff shall be subject to the same rules of discovery applicable to any other party to the case. (e) Requests for admissions.-- A party to a proceeding may serve upon any other party and upon the commission to the same extent permissible in subsection (d) a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding and to conserve hearing time, of any relevant, unprivileged, undisputed facts, the genuineness of any document described in the request, the admissibility of evidence, the order of proof and other similar matters. (f) Subpoena duces tecum.-- A party to a proceeding may obtain in accordance with commission rules a subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of or the making available for inspection, copying or photographing of relevant necessary designated documents at a prehearing conference or other specific time and place. (g) Scheduling.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority to impose schedules on the parties to the proceeding specifying the periods of time during which the parties may pursue each means of discovery available to them under the rules of the commission. Such schedules and time periods shall be set with a view to accelerating disposition of the case to the fullest extent consistent with fairness. (h) Certification of interlocutory appeals.-- Except as provided in subsection (b)(6), an interlocutory appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer on discovery shall be allowed only upon certification by the presiding officer that the ruling involves an important question of law or policy which should be resolved at that time. Notwithstanding the presiding officer's certification, the commission shall have the authority to dismiss summarily the interlocutory appeal if it should appear that the certification was improvident. An interlocutory appeal shall not result in a stay of the proceedings except upon a finding by the presiding officer and the commission that extraordinary circumstances exist. (i) Protective orders.-- The presiding officer shall have the authority, upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, to make any order, subject to the rules of the commission, which justice requires to protect the party or person. (j) Other subpoenas.-- The presiding officer shall have the power in accordance with commission rules to issue subpoenas ad testificandum and duces tecum at any time during the course of the proceeding.

(d) Release of documents.-- In addition to any other requirements imposed by law, including the act of June 21, 1957 (P.L.390, No.212), referred to as the Right-to-Know Law, and the act of July 3, 1986 (P.L.388, No.84), known as the Sunshine Act, whenever the commission conducts an investigation of an act or practice of a public utility and makes a decision, enters into a settlement with a public utility or takes any other official action, as defined in the Sunshine Act, with respect to its investigation, it shall make part of the public record and release publicly any documents relied upon by the commission in reaching its determination, whether prepared by consultants or commission employees, other than documents protected by legal privilege; provided, however, that if a document contains trade secrets or proprietary information and it has been determined by the commission that harm to the person claiming the privilege would be substantial or if a document required to be released under this section contains identifying information which would operate to the prejudice or impairment of a person's reputation or personal security, or information that would lead to the disclosure of a confidential source or subject a person to potential economic retaliation as a result of their cooperation with a commission investigation, or information which, if disclosed to the public, could be used for criminal or terroristic purposes, the identifying information may be expurgated from the copy of the document made part of the public record. For the purposes of this section, \"a document\" means a report, memorandum or other document prepared for or used by the commission in the course of its investigation whether prepared by an adviser, consultant or other person who is not an employee of the commission or by an employee of the commission.

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided in this section, when a division becomes effective, a resulting association is responsible: (1) Individually for the liabilities the resulting association undertakes or incurs in its own name after the division. (2) Individually for the liabilities of the dividing association that are allocated to or remain the liability of that resulting association to the extent specified in the plan of division, but not for liabilities allocated in the plan to another resulting association. (3) Jointly and severally with the other resulting associations for the liabilities of the dividing association that are not allocated by the plan of division. (b) Joint and several liability.-- If the allocation of a liability in a division is determined by the court as defined in section 102 (relating to definitions) to be ineffective or voidable under 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 (relating to voidable transactions) as of the effective date of the division, all of the following apply: (1) The allocation of the liability in the plan of division is ineffective and the liability becomes the liability of all of the resulting associations, jointly and severally. (2) The validity and effectiveness of the division are not affected by the action or proceeding or the determination of the court. (c) Breach of obligation.-- If a division breaches an obligation of the dividing association, all of the resulting associations are liable, jointly and severally, for the breach, but the validity and effectiveness of the division are not affected thereby. (d) Application of voidable transactions law.-- In applying 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 to a division under subsection (b): (1) 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 applies to the dividing association as follows: (i) If it does not survive the division, it is not subject to that chapter. (ii) If it survives the division, it is subject to that chapter only in its capacity as a resulting association. (2) 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 applies to each resulting association as follows: (i) The association is treated as a debtor. (ii) Each liability allocated to the association is treated as an obligation incurred by the debtor. (iii) The association is treated as not having received a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for incurring the obligation. (iv) The property allocated to the association is treated as remaining property. (3) The remedy of joint and several liability under subsection (b)(1) is deemed to be the remedy of avoidance of the transfer or obligation under 12 Pa.C.S. § 5107(a)(1) (relating to remedies of creditor). (e) Distribution tests not applicable.-- (Deleted by amendment). (f) Liens and other charges.-- Liens, security interests and other charges on the property of the dividing association are not impaired by the division, notwithstanding any otherwise enforceable allocation of liabilities of the dividing association. (g) Security agreements.-- If the dividing association is bound by a security agreement governed by 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9 (relating to secured transactions) as enacted in any jurisdiction and the security agreement provides that the security interest attaches to after-acquired collateral, each resulting association is bound by the security agreement. (h) Creditors and guarantors.-- An allocation of a liability does not: (1) Affect the rights under other law of a creditor owed payment of the liability or performance of the obligation that creates the liability, except that those rights are available only against an association responsible for the liability or obligation under this section. (2) Release or reduce the obligation of a surety or guarantor of the liability or obligation. (i) Regulatory approvals.-- The conditions in this section for freeing one or more of the resulting associations from the liabilities of the dividing association and for allocating some or all of the liabilities of the dividing association shall be conclusively deemed to have been satisfied if the plan of division has been approved by the Department of Banking and Securities, the Insurance Department or the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in a final order issued after August 21, 2001, that is not subject to further appeal. (j) Taxes.-- Any taxes, interest, penalties and public accounts of the Commonwealth claimed against the dividing association for periods prior to the effective date of the division that are settled, assessed or determined prior to or after the division shall be the liability of all of the resulting associations and, together with interest thereon, shall be a lien against the franchises and property of each resulting association. Upon the application of the dividing association, the Department of Revenue, with the concurrence of the Department of Labor and Industry, shall release one or more, but less than all, of the resulting associations from liability and liens for all taxes, interest, penalties and public accounts of the dividing association due the Commonwealth for periods prior to the effective date of the division if those departments are satisfied that the public revenues will be adequately secured.

Nothing in this section shall permit or require the commission to establish rates or procedures which are inconsistent with any other section in this title.

(b) Management efficiency investigations.-- In addition to the audits mandated by subsection (a), the commission shall appoint a management efficiency investigator who shall periodically examine the management effectiveness and operating efficiency of all utilities required to be audited under subsection (a) and monitor the utility company responses to the audits required by subsection (a). For the purposes of carrying out the periodic audit required by this subsection and for carrying out the monitoring of audits required by subsection (a), the commission is hereby empowered to direct the management efficiency investigator to conduct such investigations through and with teams made up of commission staff and/or independent consulting firms; further, the commission may designate specific items of management effectiveness and operating efficiency to be investigated. The management efficiency investigator shall provide an annual report to the commission, the affected utility, the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate detailing the findings of such investigations. (c) Use of independent auditing firms.-- The commission may require an audit under subsection (a) or (b) to be performed by an independent consulting firm. When the commission, under either subsection (a) or (b), orders an audit to be performed by an independent consulting firm, the commission, after consultation with the utility, shall select the firm and require the utility to enter into a contract with the firm providing for payment of the firm by the utility.

(a) Removal from normal operation.-- No public utility shall discontinue an electric generating unit from normal operation unless it has petitioned for and obtained the approval of the commission. The commission may, upon its own motion or upon complaint, prohibit a public utility from discontinuing an electric generating unit from normal operation if the commission determines that it would be more cost effective for the utility's ratepayers if the unit were to remain in normal operation, either with or without capital additions or operating improvements, than if the utility were to implement its plan for replacing the power which the unit is, or could be made, capable of producing. (b) Return to normal operation.-- The commission may, upon its own motion or upon complaint, order a public utility to return an electric generating unit to normal operation if the commission determines that it would be more cost effective for the utility's ratepayers if the unit were to be returned to normal operation, with or without capital additions or operating improvements, than if the utility were to implement its plan for providing the power which the unit is, or could be made, capable of producing. (c) Procedure.-- The commission may hold such hearings as it deems necessary in making the determinations required by subsection (a) or (b). The affected public utility shall have the burden of proof in any proceeding pursuant to this section. (d) Regulations.-- The commission may adopt such regulations as it deems necessary to carry out its powers and duties under this section. (e) Exclusion.-- This section shall not apply to a nuclear generating unit or to variations in operation of electric generating units to satisfy economic dispatch requirements or to maintain intrasystem or intersystem stability. (f) Construction costs.-- Notwithstanding section 1315 (relating to limitation on consideration of certain costs for electric utilities) and subject to regulations promulgated by the commission, the commission may allow a portion of the prudently incurred costs of capital additions, determined on a per megawatt basis and not to exceed 50% of the unit's undepreciated original cost per megawatt, to an electric generating unit to be made a part of the rate base or otherwise included in the rates charged by the utility before such capital additions are completed if the commission, acting pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), prohibits the utility from retiring the unit or orders the utility to return the unit to normal operation, provided that: (1) the capital additions would allow the continued or increased use of coal mined in Pennsylvania; and (2) the capital additions would be more cost effective for the utility's ratepayers than other alternatives for meeting the utility's load and capacity requirements. Notwithstanding section 1309 (relating to rates fixed on complaint; investigation of costs of production), the commission, by regulation, shall provide for a utility to remove the costs of capital additions from its rate base and to refund any revenues collected as the result of this subsection, plus interest, which shall be the average rate of interest specified for residential mortgage lending by the Secretary of Banking in accordance with the act of January 30, 1974 (P.L.13, No.6), referred to as the Loan Interest and Protection Law, during the period or periods for which the commission orders refunds, if the commission, after notice and hearing, determines that the capital addition has not been completed within a reasonable time. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section the term \"normal operation\" means the continuing availability of an electric generating unit to meet consumer demand except during: (1) Scheduled outages for repairs, tests or other procedures essential to the unit's further use. (2) Unscheduled outages caused by the unit's physical malfunctioning or breakdown. (3) Reduced levels of generation pending execution of repairs. (4) Reduced levels or complete cessation of generation, on a temporary basis, because of disruptions in fuel supplies, waste disposal or cooling water; or because of compliance with environmental protection limitations or conservation of fuel during periods of, or in anticipation of, scarcity.

(a) General rule.-- The department shall, upon payment of the required fee, issue to every qualified applicant a driver's license indicating the type or general class of vehicles the licensee is authorized to drive and any endorsements or restrictions, which license, except as provided in subsection (j), shall contain a distinguishing number assigned by the department to the licensee, the actual name, date of birth, residence address, a color photograph or photographic facsimile of the licensee, such other information as may be required by the department, and either a facsimile of the signature of the licensee or a space upon which the licensee shall write his usual signature with pen and ink. Program participants in the Address Confidentiality Program under 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 67 (relating to domestic and sexual violence victim address confidentiality) may use a substitute address designated by the Office of Victim Advocate as their address. Personal medical data and other information for use in an emergency may be included as a part of the license. Information other than that required to identify the licensee, the distinguishing number and the class of license issued may be included in microdata form. Except as provided in subsection (f), an applicant shall include his Social Security number on his license application, but the Social Security number shall not be included on the license. No driver's license shall be valid until it has been signed by the licensee. (a.1) Veteran's driver's license designation.-- (1) Beginning as soon as practicable, but no later than 18 months following the effective date of this subsection, the department shall issue a driver's license or identification card that clearly indicates that the person is a veteran of the United States Armed Forces. A qualified applicant is an individual who has served in the United States Armed Forces, including a reserve component or the National Guard, and who was discharged or released from such service under conditions other than dishonorable. (2) Upon receipt of an application from a qualified applicant accompanied by such documentation as the department shall require, the department shall independently validate the documentation and immediately issue to the veteran a driver's license or identification card displaying a veteran designation without submitting the application or documentation to the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs for review, approval or validation. There shall be no fee for the veteran designation, but the qualified applicant must pay any renewal or duplicate driver's license or identification card fees. (3) The department and the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall enter into an agreement whereby the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall reimburse the Motor License Fund for the department's actual costs of the issuance of a veteran's designation on drivers' licenses and identification cards. Reimbursement shall be paid from the Veterans' Trust Fund or such other funds available for this purpose. (4) A person who falsely represents himself as a veteran of the United States Armed Forces on an application for a driver's license or identification card is subject to the penalty under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904(b) (relating to unsworn falsification to authorities). (b) Identification card.-- The department shall, upon payment of the required fee, issue an identification card to any person ten years of age or older who has made application therefor in such manner as the department shall prescribe or whose driver's license has been surrendered to the department because of a suspension or revocation of an operating privilege under this or any other title. Program participants in the Address Confidentiality Program under 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 67 may use a substitute address designated by the Office of Victim Advocate as their address. Except as provided in subsection (j), the identification card shall have substantially the same content as a driver's license but shall clearly indicate that it is not a driver's license. Upon failure of any person to pass any examination required under section 1514 (relating to expiration and renewal of drivers' licenses), the department shall, where appropriate, issue a complimentary identification card as an expression of gratitude for years of safe driving. The card shall only be issued upon receipt of the person's driver's license. (c) Anatomical donors.-- Any person who is registered as an anatomical organ donor and who has in his possession a card issued by the recipient organization may attach the card to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card in such a way as to permit the removal of this card should the person no longer desire to be designated as an anatomical donor. Any person may also attach to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card a symbol provided by the Department of Health designating a person to be an anatomical donor. The department shall distribute such symbols at all photo license centers and shall make such symbols available in quantity to any political subdivision or organization on request. Information concerning registered donor status may be included as a part of the person's personal medical data. (d) Medical history record.-- Any person may attach to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card information relating to his personal medical history. (e) Use of identification cards.-- If a person has an established policy of accepting a driver's license issued pursuant to subsection (a) for the purpose of identification for the acceptance of a check given for payment of purchase or for the cashing of a check, the person shall also accept an identification card issued pursuant to subsection (b) for the same purpose. It shall be a defense to a prosecution under this subsection that the person was not presented with notice of the provisions of this subsection. (f) Waiver.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the department shall issue a driver's license to an otherwise eligible person who has no Social Security number if the person submits a waiver obtained from the Federal Government permitting him not to have a Social Security number. The department may require other identifiers, including, but not limited to, a taxpayer identification number, before issuing the license. (g) Completion of process.-- (1) For purposes of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-31, 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg et seq.), this subsection applies to statutes requiring determination of completion of the licensing process. (2) The process of issuing a driver's license is complete when a license bearing the licensee's photograph, photographic facsimile or image has been issued by the department. (h) Sale of photographs prohibited.-- Neither the department nor any person under contract with the department shall sell photographs of holders of a driver's license or identification card for any commercial purpose. (i) Issuance to noncitizens.-- A license issued in accordance with section 1506(a.1) (relating to application for driver's license or learner's permit) may contain an indication that the license was issued to the person who is not a citizen of the United States and who has credentials or documents issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service or its successor. (j) Undercover credential.-- The department may issue an undercover credential to Federal, State or local law enforcement officials. The department may establish guidelines concerning the issuance of such undercover credentials and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of these licenses and their issuance.

(b) Compliance with restrictions.-- No person shall operate a motor vehicle in any manner in violation of the restrictions imposed.

(a) Eligible applicants.-- The following may apply for financial assistance for operating expenses under this section: (1) The governing body of a municipality or an instrumentality of a municipality. (2) A Commonwealth agency or instrumentality. (3) A local transportation organization. (b) Applications.-- In addition to information required under section 1507 (relating to application and approval process), an application for financial assistance under this section shall include the applicant's reasonable estimates of operating revenue and government subsidies sufficient to cover all projected operating expenses. (c) Distribution formula.-- (1) No later than 15 business days after the effective date of this section, the department shall forward to the Legislative Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin the base operating allocation for each local transportation organization. (1.1) For purposes of determining the amount of assistance available for distribution under this subsection, in addition to the amounts allocated under section 1506(e)(1)(relating to fund), an amount equal to the revenue in the Public Transportation Assistance Fund dedicated pursuant to law shall be included. (2) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, each qualifying local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance which shall consist of the following: (i) Its base operating allocation multiplied by 1.0506. (ii) An additional amount which shall be allocated based on the following distribution formula: (A) Twenty-five percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of passengers. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.25. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of passengers. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of passengers for all local transportation organizations. (B) Ten percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of senior passengers to offset free fares for senior passengers. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.10. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of senior passengers. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of senior passengers for all local transportation organizations. (C) Thirty-five percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of revenue vehicle hours. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.35. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of revenue vehicle hours. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total of the revenue vehicle hours for all local transportation organizations. (D) Thirty percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of revenue vehicle miles. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.30. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of revenue vehicle miles. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of revenue vehicle miles for all local transportation organizations. (3) For the 2007-2008 fiscal year, no local transportation organization shall receive total financial assistance under this subsection that would be more than 50% higher than the amount it receives under paragraph (2)(i). For each subsequent fiscal year, the increase in the total financial assistance provided to each local transportation organization shall not exceed 20% of the prior year allocation. (c.1) Minimum.-- No local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance under this section in an amount less than the amount received in the previous fiscal year. (d) Local match requirements.-- (1) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, except as provided under paragraph (2), financial assistance provided under this section shall be matched by local or private cash funding in an amount not less than the greater of: (i) 15% of the amount of the financial assistance being provided; or (ii) the amount required under former section 1311(d) (relating to use of funds distributed) for fiscal year 2006-2007. (2) Beginning in fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, if the local matching funds provided are less than 15% of the amount of financial assistance received, the local transportation organization's required local matching funds shall increase annually in order to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). The local matching funds shall be increased annually by a minimum of 5% above the amount of local matching funds provided in the previous fiscal year unless a lesser amount is necessary to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). (3) Eligible local matching funds shall consist only of cash contributions provided by one or more municipalities or counties. The amount of the match and the time period during which the match must continue to be available shall be specified in the financial assistance agreement. Funding provided by local and private entities, including advertising or naming rights, may qualify as local matching funds to the extent they provide for the cost of transit service that is open to the public. The following shall not be considered local matching funds: (i) Any form of transit operating revenue or other forms of transit income provided by the local transportation organization. (ii) Funds used to replace fares. (4) A municipality in a metropolitan area which is a member of a local transportation organization is authorized to provide annual financial assistance from current revenues to the local transportation organization of which it is a member or enter into a long-term agreement for payment of money to assist in defraying the costs of operation, maintenance and debt service of the local transportation organization or of a particular public transportation project of a local transportation organization. The obligation of a municipality under an agreement pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered to be a part of the indebtedness of the municipality, nor shall the obligation be deemed to impair the status of any indebtedness of the municipality which would otherwise be considered self-sustaining. (e) Performance reviews.-- (1) The department may conduct performance reviews of an award recipient under this section to determine the effectiveness of the financial assistance. Reviews shall be conducted at regular intervals as established by the department in consultation with the management of the award recipient. After completion of a review, the department shall issue a report that: (i) highlights exceptional performance and identifies any problems that need to be resolved; (ii) assesses performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of the financial assistance; (iii) makes recommendations on follow-up actions required to remedy any problem identified; and (iv) provides an action plan documenting who should perform the recommended actions and a time frame within which they should be performed. (2) The department shall deliver the report to the Governor, to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the Senate and to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives. The department's regulations shall contain a description of the impact on both the amount of, and future eligibility for, financial assistance under this chapter based upon the degree to which the local transportation organization complies with the recommendations in the report. The department shall develop a list of best practices revealed by the reports issued under this subsection and shall post them on the department's Internet website. (f) Performance criteria.-- Criteria used for the reviews conducted under subsection (e) shall consist of passengers per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per revenue vehicle hour, operating revenue per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per passenger and other items as the department may establish. The department's regulations shall set forth the minimum system performance criteria based upon comparison of the award recipient to its past performance and to its peers that an award recipient must satisfy. (g) Failure to satisfy minimum performance criteria.-- (1) If a performance review conducted under subsection (e) reveals that the performance of an award recipient's transportation system has decreased compared to performance determined through a prior review, the department may, upon the written request of an award recipient, waive any requirement for a reduction in the amount of financial assistance to be awarded under this section for a reasonable time period to allow the award recipient to bring the system back to the required performance level. The award recipient shall provide written justification for providing a time period longer than two years. In order to obtain the waiver for the period requested, the award recipient must do all of the following: (i) Develop an action plan to improve system performance that contains key measurable milestones. The action plan must be acceptable to the department and must be approved by the department in writing. (ii) Submit quarterly progress reports on the action plan to the department. (2) The department shall review and evaluate the award recipient's progress to determine if the system has improved. If the system has improved, the award recipient will remain eligible for full formula funding as determined under subsection (c). If the system has not improved by the end of the waiver period, the waiver will be withdrawn. Expenses incurred by the award recipient as a result of the failure of the award recipient's system to meet the minimum performance criteria shall be borne by the award recipient. (h) Adjustments to minimum performance criteria.-- Upon written request of an award recipient, the department may adjust the minimum performance criteria described in subsection (g) in a given year if the performance of the award recipient's system is adversely affected by circumstances which are beyond the award recipient's control. Examples are labor strikes, infrastructure failures and natural disasters. The request must include the award recipient's reasons for seeking the adjustment. Cross References.

(a) Application for continued service.-- At any time before or after service is terminated by a public utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer, the affected tenants may apply to the utility to have service continued or resumed. (b) Payment of charges by tenants.-- A public utility shall not terminate service or shall promptly resume service previously terminated if it receives from the tenants an amount equal to the bill for the affected account of the landlord ratepayer for the billing month preceding the notice to the tenants. Thereafter, the utility shall notify each tenant of the total amount of the bill for the second and each succeeding billing month and, if the tenants fail to make payment of any bill within 30 days of the delivery of the notice to the tenants, the utility may commence termination of service, except that no termination may occur until 30 days after each tenant has been furnished notice of the proposed termination as prescribed in section 1528 (relating to delivery and contents of subsequent termination notice to tenants). The tenant or tenants shall make payment to the utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer by check or money order drawn by the tenant to the order of the utility or by cash. In all cases, the tenant shall provide, upon request, reasonable identification to the utility. For the purposes of this section, \"reasonable identification\" shall include, but not be limited to, a driver's license, photo identification, medical assistance or food stamp identification or any similar document issued by any public agency which contains the name and address of the tenant. (c) Disposition of payment by utility.-- Upon receiving any payment, the utility shall notify the landlord ratepayer who is liable for the utility service of the amount or amounts paid by any tenant and the amount or amounts credited to the landlord's bill for each tenant pursuant to this section. Tenants requesting continued utility service under this section, except those individually subscribing for service under subsection (d), shall not be considered utility customers but shall be considered to be acting on behalf of the landlord ratepayer, who shall remain liable to the utility for service provided after notice to tenants. In the event that the tenants fail to satisfy the requirements of subsection (b) with regard to the first billing month period preceding notice to the tenant, the utility shall refund any moneys received from a tenant to that tenant. Any payments made by the tenants shall be applied first against the bill for the billing month preceding notice to the tenants and then against bills for service rendered subsequent to the bill. Upon termination of service to the tenants for failure to pay the utility bill for service in full for any subsequent month or upon voluntary discontinuance of service at the request of the tenants, the utility shall immediately refund to the tenants any amounts paid to the utility for the billing period for which payment in full was not remitted. (d) Agreement for individual service.-- Any tenant of a residential building or mobile home park who has been notified of a proposed discontinuance of utility service pursuant to section 1523 (relating to notices before service to landlord discontinued) shall have the right to agree to subscribe for future service individually if this can be accomplished without a major revision of distribution facilities or additional right-of-way acquisitions.

(b) Mandatory joinder of dissenters.-- All dissenters, wherever residing, whose demands have not been settled shall be made parties to the proceeding as in an action against their shares. A copy of the application shall be served on each such dissenter. If a dissenter is a nonresident, the copy may be served on him in the manner provided or prescribed by or pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 53 (relating to bases of jurisdiction and interstate and international procedure). (c) Jurisdiction of the court.-- The jurisdiction of the court shall be plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint an appraiser to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the issue of fair value. The appraiser shall have such power and authority as may be specified in the order of appointment or in any amendment thereof. (d) Measure of recovery.-- Each dissenter who is made a party shall be entitled to recover the amount by which the fair value of his shares is found to exceed the amount, if any, previously remitted, plus interest. (e) Effect of corporation's failure to file application.-- If the corporation fails to file an application as provided in subsection (a), any dissenter who made a demand and who has not already settled his claim against the corporation may do so in the name of the corporation at any time within 30 days after the expiration of the 60-day period. If a dissenter does not file an application within the 30-day period, each dissenter entitled to file an application shall be paid the corporation's estimate of the fair value of the shares and no more, and may bring an action to recover any amount not previously remitted.

      "text": "§ 1705. Election of tort options. (a) Financial responsibility requirements.-- (1) Each insurer, not less than 45 days prior to the first renewal of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall notify in writing each named insured of the availability of two alternatives of full tort insurance and limited tort insurance described in subsections (c) and (d). The notice shall be a standardized form adopted by the commissioner and shall include the following language: NOTICE TO NAMED INSUREDS A. \"Limited Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania give you the right to choose a form of insurance that limits your right and the right of members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses, but not for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages unless the injuries suffered fall within the definition of \"serious injury\" as set forth in the policy or unless one of several other exceptions noted in the policy applies. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"limited tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. B. \"Full Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also give you the right to choose a form of insurance under which you maintain an unrestricted right for you and the members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses and may also seek financial compensation for pain and suffering and other nonmonetary damages as a result of injuries caused by other drivers. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"full tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. C. You may contact your insurance agent, broker or company to discuss the cost of other coverages. D. If you wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A, you must sign this notice where indicated below and return it. If you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date E. If you wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B, you may sign this notice where indicated below and return it. However, if you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date (2) Insurers shall print the above notice containing both options on one sheet in prominent type and place in a prominent location. Any person signing, or otherwise bound by, a document containing such terms is bound by such election and is precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed in making the election between full tort or limited tort alternatives. Where there are two or more named insureds on a policy, any named insured may make the full or limited tort election provided for in this section for all named insureds on the policy. (3) If a named insured who receives a notice under paragraph (1) does not indicate a choice within 20 days, the insurer shall send a second notice. The second notice shall be in a form identical to the first notice, except that it shall be identified as a second and final notice. If a named insured has not responded to either notice ten days prior to the renewal date, the named insured and those he is empowered by this section to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. All notices required by this section shall advise that if no tort election is made, the named insured and those he is empowered to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. Any person subject to the limited tort option by virtue of this section shall be precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed. (4) Each insurer, prior to the first issuance of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall provide each applicant with the notice required by paragraph (1). A policy may not be issued until the applicant has been provided an opportunity to elect a tort option. (5) An owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle who does not have financial responsibility shall be deemed to have chosen the limited tort alternative. (6) Nothing in this section changes or modifies the existing requirement that owners of registered vehicles maintain bodily injury and property damage liability insurance arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. (b) Application of tort options.-- (1) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all private passenger motor vehicle policies of the named insured issued by the same insurer and shall continue in force as to all subsequent renewal policies, replacement policies and any other private passenger motor vehicle policies under which the individual is a named insured until the insurer, or its authorized representative, receives a properly executed form electing the other tort option. (2) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all insureds under the private passenger motor vehicle policy who are not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy. In the case where more than one private passenger motor vehicle policy is applicable to an insured and the policies have conflicting tort options, the insured is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the private passenger motor vehicle in which the insured is an occupant at the time of the accident if he is an insured on that policy and bound by the full tort option otherwise. (3) An individual who is not an owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle and who is not a named insured or insured under any private passenger motor vehicle policy shall not be precluded from maintaining an action for noneconomic loss or economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (c) Full tort alternative.-- Each person who is bound by the full tort election remains eligible to seek compensation for noneconomic loss claimed and economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (d) Limited tort alternative.-- Each person who elects the limited tort alternative remains eligible to seek compensation for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. Unless the injury sustained is a serious injury, each person who is bound by the limited tort election shall be precluded from maintaining an action for any noneconomic loss, except that: (1) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election who sustains damages in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person may recover damages as if the individual damaged had elected the full tort alternative whenever the person at fault: (i) is convicted or accepts Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in that accident; (ii) is operating a motor vehicle registered in another state; (iii) intends to injure himself or another person, provided that an individual does not intentionally injure himself or another person merely because his act or failure to act is intentional or done with his realization that it creates a grave risk of causing injury or the act or omission causing the injury is for the purpose of averting bodily harm to himself or another person; or (iv) has not maintained financial responsibility as required by this chapter, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall affect the limitation of section 1731(d)(2) (relating to availability, scope and amount of coverage). (2) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights with respect to claims against a person in the business of designing, manufacturing, repairing, servicing or otherwise maintaining motor vehicles arising out of a defect in such motor vehicle which is caused by or not corrected by an act or omission in the course of such business, other than a defect in a motor vehicle which is operated by such business. (3) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights if injured while an occupant of a motor vehicle other than a private passenger motor vehicle. (e) Nondiscrimination.-- No insurer shall cancel, refuse to write or refuse to renew a motor vehicle insurance policy based on the tort option election of the named insured. Any violation of this subsection shall be deemed a violation of the Automobile Insurance Policy Act. (f) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases when used in this section shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Insured.\" Any individual residing in the household of the named insured who is: (1) a spouse or other relative of the named insured; or (2) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured. \"Named insured.\" Any individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.

Purchases shall be made from or the contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder. Sales shall be made to the highest responsive, responsible bidder. No purchase of any unique article or other articles which cannot be obtained in the open market shall be made without express approval of the board where the amount involved is in excess of $25,000.

Bids shall be publicly opened and read aloud at a date, time and place designated in the invitation to bid.

(e) Waiver.-- Competitive bidding requirements may be waived if it is determined by the general manager, or in such other manner as the board may provide, that an emergency directly and immediately affecting customer service or public health, safety or welfare requires immediate delivery of supplies, materials, equipment or services. A record of circumstances explaining the emergency shall be submitted to the board at its next regular meeting and thereafter kept on file. (f) Sale or lease of real property.-- Contracts for the sale or lease of real property owned by the authority shall be awarded after competitive bidding as shown in subsection (b), except as provided in section 1741(a)(22) where the contract is entered into with the Commonwealth or any government agency or with the United States government or any agency or instrumentality thereof or as provided in section 1741(a)(24). (g) Property management contracts.-- Contracts for the management of authority-owned property, such as bus routes or subway systems, may be negotiated and awarded by an affirmative vote of one more than a majority of all members of the board.

(i) Rejection of bids.-- The authority shall have the right to reject any or all bids or parts of any or all bids, whenever, in the opinion of the board, rejection is necessary for the protection of the interests of the authority. In every case, a record shall be made setting forth the reason for the rejection, which record shall thereafter be kept on file. (j) Rules and regulations.-- The board may by resolution adopt policies to effectuate the provisions of this section. (k) Concessions.-- All concessions granted by the authority for the sale of products or the rendition of services for a consideration on authority property shall be awarded only under written specifications after competitive bidding and to the highest responsive, responsible bidder in a manner similar to that required by subsection (b). This requirement for competitive bidding shall not apply to any concession which has been granted by a transportation system acquired by the authority and which by the terms of the agreement granting it will terminate within one year from date of the acquisition of the transportation system by the authority nor to any concession involving the estimated receipt by the authority of less than the base amount of $18,500, subject to adjustment under subsection (l), over the period for which the concession is granted. (l) Adjustments.-- Adjustments to the base amounts specified under subsections (b), (d) and (k) shall be made as follows: (1) The Department of Labor and Industry shall determine the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPI-U) for the United States City Average as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2012, and for each successive 12-month period thereafter. (2) If the department determines that there is no positive percentage change, then no adjustment to the base amounts shall occur for the relevant time period provided for in this subsection. (3) (i) If the department determines that there is a positive percentage change in the first year that the determination is made under paragraph (1), the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by each base amount, and the products shall be added to the base amounts, respectively, and the sums shall be preliminary adjusted amounts. (ii) The preliminary adjusted amounts shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (b), (d) and (k). (4) In each successive year in which there is a positive percentage change in the CPI-U for the United States City Average, the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by the most recent preliminary adjusted amounts, and the products shall be added to the preliminary adjusted amount of the prior year to calculate the preliminary adjusted amounts for the current year. The sums thereof shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the new final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (b), (d) and (k). (5) The determinations and adjustments required under this subsection shall be made in the period between October 1 and November 15 of the year following the effective date of this subsection and annually between October 1 and November 15 of each year thereafter. (6) The final adjusted base amounts and new final adjusted base amounts obtained under paragraphs (3) and (4) shall become effective January 1 for the calendar year following the year in which the determination required under paragraph (1) is made. (7) The department shall publish notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin prior to January 1 of each calendar year of the annual percentage change determined under paragraph (1) and the unadjusted or final adjusted base amounts determined under paragraphs (3) and (4) at which competitive bidding is required under subsection (b) or (k) and the amount at which competitive bidding may apply to purchase sales under subsection (d), for the calendar year beginning the first day of January after publication of the notice. The notice shall include a written and illustrative explanation of the calculations performed by the department in establishing the unadjusted or final adjusted base amounts under this subsection for the ensuing calendar year. (8) The annual increase in the preliminary adjusted base amounts obtained under paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not exceed 3%. (Nov. 3, 2011, P.L.367, No.90, eff. imd.) 2011 Amendment.

(b) Procedures for election of directors.-- The following apply to the election of directors: (1) Unless otherwise restricted in the bylaws, in elections for directors at a meeting of shareholders held at a geographic location, voting need not be by ballot unless required by vote of the shareholders before the voting for election of directors begins. The shareholders do not have the right to vote by ballot at a meeting that is not held at a geographic location pursuant to section 1708(c) (relating to use of conference telephone or other electronic technology). (2) Unless otherwise provided in a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, the candidates for election as directors receiving the highest number of votes from each class or group of classes, if any, entitled to elect directors separately up to the number of directors to be elected by the class or group of classes shall be elected. This paragraph applies retroactively, and a bylaw described in this paragraph shall be valid if it was adopted after January 1, 2000. (3) If at any meeting of shareholders, directors of more than one class are to be elected, each class of directors shall be elected in a separate election. (c) Cumulative voting.-- (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) or in the articles, in each election of directors every shareholder entitled to vote shall have the right to multiply the number of votes to which he may be entitled by the total number of directors to be elected in the same election by the holders of the class or classes of shares of which his shares are a part and he may cast the whole number of his votes for one candidate or he may distribute them among any two or more candidates. (2) The shareholders of a corporation not incorporated under the Business Corporation Law of 1933 or this subpart, the shareholders of which were not entitled to cumulate their votes for the election of directors at the date the corporation became subject to the provisions of the Business Corporation Law of 1933 or became or becomes subject to the provisions of this subpart, shall be entitled so to cumulate their votes only if and to the extent its articles so provide. (d) Redeemable shares.-- Unless otherwise provided in the articles, redeemable shares that have been called for redemption shall not be entitled to vote on any matter and shall not be deemed outstanding shares after written notice has been mailed to holders thereof that the shares have been called for redemption and that a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a specified financial institution with irrevocable instruction and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders of the shares on the redemption date, in the case of uncertificated shares, or upon surrender of certificates therefor in the case of certificated shares, and the sum has been so deposited.

An unrevoked proxy shall not be valid after three years from the date of its signature, authentication or transmission unless a longer time is expressly provided therein.

(b) Nonresident.-- The nonresident owner of a motor vehicle not registered in this Commonwealth may give proof of financial responsibility by filing with the department a written certificate or certificates of an insurance company authorized to transact business in the state in which the motor vehicle or motor vehicles described in the certificate are registered or, if the nonresident does not own a motor vehicle, then evidence satisfactory to the department that the person does not own a motor vehicle. The department shall accept the certificate upon condition that the insurance company complies with the following provisions with respect to the policies so certified: (1) The insurance company shall execute a power of attorney authorizing the department to accept service on its behalf or process in any action arising out of a motor vehicle accident in this Commonwealth. (2) The insurance company shall agree in writing that the policies shall be deemed to conform with the laws of this Commonwealth relating to the terms of motor vehicle liability policies issued in this Commonwealth. (c) Default by foreign insurance company.-- If any insurance company not authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth, which has qualified to furnish proof of financial responsibility, defaults in any undertakings or agreements, the department shall not thereafter accept as proof any certificate of the company whether theretofore filed or thereafter tendered as proof as long as the default continues. (d) Financial responsibility identification cards.-- Insurers shall provide financial responsibility identification cards to insureds which shall be valid only for the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured. If the insured and insurer both agree, the insurer may issue the financial responsibility identification card solely in electronic format. Financial responsibility identification cards shall disclose the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured and shall contain such other information as required by the Insurance Department. In such instance where the insured has financed premiums through a premium finance company or where the insured is on an insurer-sponsored or agency-sponsored payment plan, financial responsibility identification cards may be issued for periods of six months even though such payment by the insured may be for a period of less than six months. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the immediate issuance of financial responsibility identification cards where an insured replaces an insured vehicle, adds a vehicle or increases coverages under an existing policy for which a premium adjustment is required. (e) Immunity.-- If an insured chooses to provide proof of financial responsibility to be viewed in an electronic format on an electronic device pursuant to section 1786 (relating to required financial responsibility), a police officer administering in good faith this subchapter shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability which arises from the insured's choice, including the inadvertent viewing of materials on the device other than the proof of financial responsibility, inadvertent deletion of information from the device, inadvertent interception of a communication while in possession of the device and breakage which occurs to the device.

(d) Partial payment for shares.-- The controlling person or group shall then make a partial payment for the shares so surrendered or transferred to the court, within ten business days of receipt of the notice from the court, at a per-share price equal to the partial payment amount. The court shall then make payment as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten business days, to the shareholders who so surrender or transfer their shares to the court of the appropriate per-share amount received from the controlling person or group.

(f) Appraisal procedure.-- The appraiser so appointed by the court shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, determine the fair value of the shares subject to its appraisal and the appropriate market rate of interest on the amount then owed by the controlling person or group to the holders of the shares. The determination of any appraiser so appointed by the court shall be final and binding on both the controlling person or group and all shareholders who so surrendered their share certificates or transferred their shares to the court, except that the determination of the appraiser shall be subject to review to the extent and within the time provided or prescribed by law in the case of other appointed judicial officers. See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5105(a)(3) (relating to right to appellate review) and 5571(b) (relating to appeals generally).

(a) General rule.-- The purpose of this subchapter is to protect certain registered corporations and legitimate interests of various groups related to such corporations from certain manipulative and coercive actions. Specifically, this subchapter seeks to: (1) Protect registered corporations from being exposed to and paying \"greenmail.\" (2) Promote a stable relationship among the various parties involved in registered corporations, including the public whose confidence in the future of a corporation tends to be undermined when a corporation is put \"in play.\" (3) Ensure that speculators who put registered corporations \"in play\" do not misappropriate corporate values for themselves at the expense of the corporation and groups affected by corporate actions. (4) Discourage such speculators from putting registered corporations \"in play\" through any means, including, but not limited to, offering to purchase at least 20% of the voting shares of the corporation or threatening to wage or waging a proxy contest in connection with or as a means toward or part of a plan to acquire control of the corporation, with the effect of reaping short-term speculative profits. Moreover, this subchapter recognizes the right and obligation of the Commonwealth to regulate and protect the corporations it creates from abuses resulting from the application of its own laws affecting generally corporate governance and particularly director obligations, mergers and related matters. Such laws, and the obligations imposed on directors or others thereunder, should not be the vehicles by which registered corporations are manipulated in certain instances for the purpose of obtaining short-term profits. (b) Limitations.-- The purpose of this subchapter is not to affect legitimate shareholder activity that does not involve putting a corporation \"in play\" or involve seeking to acquire control of the corporation. Specifically, the purpose of this subchapter is not to: (1) curtail proxy contests on matters properly submitted for shareholder action under applicable State or other law, including, but not limited to, certain elections of directors, corporate governance matters such as cumulative voting or staggered boards, or other corporate matters such as environmental issues or conducting business in a particular country if, in any such instance, such proxy contest is not utilized in connection with or as a means toward or part of a plan to put the corporation \"in play\" or to seek to acquire control of the corporation; or (2) affect the solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of the corporation in connection with shareholder meetings or actions of the corporation.",

(3) Regulate or impose any conditions upon any activity or use not currently authorized under applicable State statutes and regulations. (b) Limitations on water allocation authority.-- The General Assembly reiterates the declarations of other statutes reflecting the need to manage water resources on a watershed basis without respect to political boundaries and the understanding that water management programs should be based upon an accurate and current State water plan. Accordingly, no political subdivision shall have any power to allocate water resources or to regulate the location, amount, timing, terms or conditions of any water withdrawal by any person. (c) Limitations on municipalities.-- Nothing in subsection (b) shall affect the power of any municipality to adopt and enforce ordinances pursuant to 35 Pa.C.S. Pt.

(d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart. (2) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made pursuant to this subpart.

If a planned community is subject to the provisions of this paragraph, a declarant shall: (i) include provisions in any sales agreement for a unit of such planned community which states that an association exists or may be created to own and manage certain generally described common elements or limited common elements and that there may be imposed by the association assessments upon unit owners for expenses related to the ownership, management, administration or regulation of such elements; and (ii) prepare and record a declaration in the manner set forth in section 5205 (relating to contents of declaration; all planned communities) or 5206 (relating to contents of declaration for flexible planned communities) or covenants and restrictions as may be appropriate for the planned community. The declarant shall provide to the purchaser copies of the proposed or recorded declaration or covenants and restrictions, an actual or proposed budget of the planned community in accordance with the provisions of section 5402(a)(7) (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) and the actual or proposed bylaws of the association, provided that the purchaser has the right, before conveyance, to cancel the agreement within seven days of the date of receiving a copy of the proposed or recorded declaration or covenants and restrictions, the actual or proposed budget and the actual or proposed bylaws. As used in this paragraph, the term \"open space\" shall include an area of land or an area of water or a combination of land and water within a planned community intended for the use or enjoyment of residents, including, but not limited to, ball fields and courts, parks, walking, hiking or biking trails, wetlands, wooded areas and walkways and driveways providing access thereto or parking intended for users of such open space. The term does not include streets, utility lines or facilities or swimming pools or clubhouses owned or leased and maintained by the association. (b) Retroactivity.-- Except as provided in subsection (c), sections 5105, 5106, 5107, 5203 (relating to construction and validity of declaration and bylaws), 5204 (relating to description of units), 5218, 5219 (relating to amendment of declaration), 5223 (relating to merger or consolidation of planned community), 5302(a)(1) through (6) and (11) through (15) (relating to power of unit owners' association), 5311 (relating to tort and contract liability), 5315 (relating to lien for assessments), 5316 (relating to association records), 5407 (relating to resales of units) and 5412 (relating to effect of violations on rights of action) and section 5103 (relating to definitions), to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all planned communities created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart; but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subpart and do not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those planned communities. (b.1) Retroactivity.-- (1) Sections 5103, 5108, 5113, 5220(i) (relating to termination of planned community), 5222 (relating to master associations), 5302(a)(8)(i), (16) and (17) (relating to power of unit owners' association), 5303(a) and (b) (relating to executive board members and officers), 5307 (relating to upkeep of planned community), 5314 (relating to assessments for common expenses) and 5319 (relating to other liens affecting planned community), to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all planned communities created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those planned communities. (2) Section 5303(c) and (d), to the extent necessary in construing any of those subsections, apply to all planned communities created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those subsections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring 180 days after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those planned communities. (c) Nonflexible planned communities.-- If a planned community created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains no more than 12 units and is not a flexible planned community, it is subject only to sections 5105, 5106, 5107 and 5218 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that planned community. (d) Amendments to declarations, bylaws, plats and plans.-- (1) In the case of amendments to the declaration, bylaws and plats and plans of any planned community created before the effective date of this subpart: (i) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made under this subpart. (ii) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made under this subpart. (2) An amendment to the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the document being amended. If any such amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this subpart, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in this subpart also apply to that person. (e) Nonresidential units.-- This subpart does not apply to a planned community in which all units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use unless the declaration provides that the subpart does apply to that planned community. This subpart applies to a planned community containing both units which are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use and other units which are not so restricted only if the declaration so provides or if the real estate comprising the units which may be used for residential purposes would be a planned community in the absence of the units which may not be used for residential purposes. (f) Planned communities outside Commonwealth.-- This subpart does not apply to planned communities or units located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions under sections 5402 (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) through 5405 (relating to public offering statement; planned community securities) shall apply to all contracts for the disposition thereof signed in this Commonwealth by any purchaser unless exempt under section 5401(b)(2) (relating to applicability; waiver).

(c) Acquisition of part of common facilities.-- If part of the common facilities is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the award attributable to the interest of the association in the common facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining common facilities among the unit owners in proportion to the common expense liability attributable to the units before the taking, but any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common facility shall be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that limited common facility was allocated at the time of acquisition or in any manner as provided in the declaration. (d) Acquisition of part of controlled facilities.-- If, as part of a unit acquired by eminent domain, controlled facilities are taken which benefit other units, that portion of the award attributable to the interest of the other units in the controlled facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining controlled facilities equally among the unit owners whose units were benefited by the controlled facilities that have been taken.

The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service credit in that county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous county employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer, by the member, county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's county or municipal pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the county or municipal pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by December 31, 1987, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by December 31, 1987.

Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service in accordance with county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system benefit provisions, multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members. The Public Employee Retirement Study Commission shall determine the appropriate amount of employer contributions to be transferred to the system by the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems. (2) If the member died prior to the effective date of this subsection, the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1). In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by December 31, 1987. If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before January 1, 1988, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by March 31, 1988. If the member dies after December 31, 1987, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), neither the member or his estate shall receive credit for the prior service.

(2) The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service in the \"predecessor corporation\" transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, the provisions of section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer by the member or the \"predecessor corporation\" to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the member's pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by June 30, 1992, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the \"predecessor corporation\" pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by June 30, 1992. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall pay as pick-up contributions the difference between the amount credited to the member's account and the amount otherwise due under section 5504. Such additional contributions paid by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall not be considered compensation for the purposes of this part. If the amount transferred to the system by the member is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members so long as the amount to be transferred is equal to or less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee. In the event that the amount required to be transferred is greater than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee shall be transferred to the system, and the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system the additional funds needed to satisfy the requirements of the calculation in this paragraph. If the amount required to be transferred is less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority may retain the amount not needed for transfer. (3) If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before July 1, 1992, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or may request that the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by September 30, 1992. If the member dies after June 30, 1992, without making the transfer or without requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), neither the member nor his estate shall receive credit for the prior service.

(2) The employee shall elect to receive the credit by filing an application with the board while an active member no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act. (3) Contributions to be paid by an active member for credit for New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be sufficient to provide an amount equal to the regular and additional accumulated deductions which would have been standing to the credit of the member for such service had regular and additional member contributions been made to the board with full coverage as a Class A member during the period of New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and had these regular and additional accumulated deductions been credited with statutory interest up to the date of purchase. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account.

(9) In the event the member is or was an annuitant, any annuity paid or payable during the period of such service with the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network shall be canceled retroactive to the date the member began service with the New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network, any such annuity payments made to the member shall be repaid by the member, and the provisions of section 5706 (relating to termination of annuities) shall apply if applicable. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account. The amount of annuity repayments so determined by the board shall be the obligation of the member who requested credit for New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service, and in no event shall such amount be an obligation of the Office of Attorney General and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network.

Additionally, all creditable State service and nonstate service reinstated or purchased while an employee of the Juvenile Court Judges' Commission shall be canceled.

(a) Action authorized.-- An action to enjoin or abate a violation of this chapter may be brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by the Attorney General, the district attorney of the county concerned or the solicitor of the municipality in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. The action shall be brought and tried as an action in equity in the court of common pleas of the county in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. (b) Procedure.-- (1) If it is made to appear, by affidavits or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court that a violation exists, a temporary writ of injunction shall forthwith issue, directed to the operator of the adult entertainment establishment or the owner of the premises, or both, restraining the operator or owner from continuing or permitting the continuation of any violation or violations of this chapter until the conclusion of the hearing and a decision by the court. No bond shall be required in instituting such proceedings. This chapter, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity. (2) It shall not be necessary for the court to find the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but, on finding that the material allegations of the petition are true, the court shall order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises be used in violation of this chapter. Upon judgment of the court ordering the violations to be abated, the court may order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises shall be occupied or used for any purpose for up to one year following the date of the court's order, but the court may, in its discretion, permit the premises to be occupied or used by the operator or owner if the operator or owner, or both, posts a bond or a joint bond in the discretion of the court with sufficient surety to be approved by the court in the penal and liquidated sum of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and conditioned that neither the building nor a part of the building be used in violation of this chapter and that the operator will pay all fines, costs and damages that may be assessed for any violation of this chapter upon the premises. (3) Service of any preliminary or permanent injunction shall be made personally upon the operator and owner of the premises if such persons can be found in the county. If the operator or owner cannot be found, a copy of the order shall be delivered to any employee of the operator on the establishment premises or, in the case of the owner, upon an agent, if any. If no employee or agent can be found or service cannot be made on an employee or agent of the owner, then service shall be made as the court may direct. Any person other than the operator or owner who shall be served with any notice of an injunction shall within 24 hours thereafter deliver the notice to the operator or owner, as the case may be, or mail it to the operator or owner by registered mail if the address of the operator or owner, as the case may be, is known to the person served. Suspension by Court Order. Subsec. (b)(1) was suspended July 31, 1997, S.Ct.

(a) Employer contribution rate on behalf of active members.-- For each fiscal year, the amount of the Commonwealth and other employer contributions on behalf of all active members shall be computed by the actuary as a percentage of the total compensation of all active members during the period for which the amount is determined and shall be so certified by the board. The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall consist of the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b), and the accrued liability contribution rate as defined in subsection (c). The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall be modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in subsection (f). (b) Employer normal contribution rate.-- The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined after each actuarial valuation on the basis of an annual interest rate and such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the board in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined as follows: (1) From the effective date of this paragraph through fiscal year 2021-2022, as a level percentage of the compensation of the average new active member, which percentage, if contributed on the basis of his prospective compensation through his entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to him in excess of that portion funded by his prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (2) For fiscal year 2022-2023 and each fiscal year thereafter, as a level percentage of the compensation of all active members, which percentage, if contributed from the start of their employment on the basis of their prospective compensation through their entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to them in excess of that portion funded by their prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (c) Accrued liability contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2003, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits, except for the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708 (relating to supplemental annuities), 5708.1 (relating to additional supplemental annuities), 5708.2 (relating to further additional supplemental annuities), 5708.3 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1994), 5708.4 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment), 5708.5 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1998), 5708.6 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2002), 5708.7 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2003) and 5708.8 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002), in excess of the total assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all investment gains and losses over a five-year period), excluding the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members on December 31, 2001, and excluding contributions to be transferred by county retirement systems or pension plans pursuant to section 5507(c) (relating to contributions to the system by the Commonwealth and other employers). The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002, except that, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2002, but before July 1, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded over a period of ten years from the first day of July, coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution for such additional legislative liabilities shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the first annual payment. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, the outstanding balance of the increase in accrued liability due to the change in benefits enacted in 2001 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2002, and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in calendar year 2002 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2003. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2003, but before January 1, 2009, such additional liability shall be funded in equal dollar annual contributions over a period of ten years from the first day of July coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. (3) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund in equal dollar installments over a period of 30 years from July 1, 2010, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits calculated as of the immediately prior valuation date, including the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8, but excluding the benefits payable from the retirement benefit plan established pursuant to section 5941 (relating to benefits completion plan), in excess of the actuarially calculated assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses each year in level annual installments over five years), including the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer will receive for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members, inactive members on leave without pay, vestees and special vestees on December 31, 2009. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (4) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as provided for under this section, except that the rate shall be computed as a rate of total compensation of all active members and active participants for the applicable period and the accrued liability shall be determined and the rate shall be computed without regard to the portion of any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h) for which an annual setoff has not been credited or recognized in a prior fiscal year. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2016, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. In addition to any employer defined contributions made to the trust, the Commonwealth and other employers of participants shall make the accrued liability contributions to the fund certified by the board. (d) Special provisions on calculating contributions.-- In calculating the contributions required by subsections (a), (b) and (c), the active members of Class C shall be considered to be members of Class A. In addition, the actuary shall determine the Commonwealth or other employer contributions required for active members of Class C and officers of the Pennsylvania State Police and enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board who are members of Class A to finance their benefits in excess of those to which other members of Class A are entitled. Such additional contributions shall be determined separately for officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police and for enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. Such contributions payable on behalf of officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police shall include the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of May 12, 1943 (P.L.259, No.120), referred to as the Foreign Casualty Insurance Premium Tax Allocation Law, and on behalf of enforcement officers or investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of April 12, 1951 (P.L.90, No.21), known as the Liquor Code. (e) Supplemental annuity contribution rate.-- (1) For the period July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4 and 5708.5 shall be paid over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002. The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2002 provided for in section 5708.6 shall be as provided in section 5708.6(f). The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2003 provided for in section 5708.7 shall be as provided in section 5708.7(f). The funding for the special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002 under section 5708.8 shall be as provided in section 5708.8(g). The amount of each annual supplemental annuities contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002. (2) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8 shall be paid as part of the accrued liability contribution rate as provided for in subsection (c)(3), and there shall not be a separate supplemental annuity contribution rate attributable to those supplemental annuities. In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (f) Experience adjustment factor.-- (1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability and any increase or decrease in the liabilities and funding for supplemental annuities, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience (recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses over a five-year period), changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, State employees making shared-risk member contributions or having shared-gain adjustments to their regular member contributions, payment of additional accrued liability contributions under section 5507(g), changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of 30 years beginning with the July 1 succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases. The experience adjustment factor calculated under this paragraph shall be determined without regard to any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h). (2) The actuarially required contribution rate shall be the sum of the normal contribution rate, the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate, modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in paragraph (1). (g) Determination of liability for special vestee.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or other law, the total additional accrued actuarial liability resulting from eligibility of special vestees for benefits upon the attainment of superannuation age shall be determined by the actuary as part of the first annual valuation made after June 30, 1997. The resulting additional accrued actuarial liability shall be paid by The Pennsylvania State University to the board in one lump sum payment within 90 days of the board's certification of the amount to The Pennsylvania State University. (h) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.-- The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation to the prior year's final contribution rate. If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by the respective percentage above of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all subsequent fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not apply. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of total compensation of all active members. (i) Final contribution rate.-- For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate shall be 5% of total compensation of all active members. For each subsequent fiscal year for which the collared contribution rate is applicable, the final contribution rate shall be the collared contribution rate plus the costs added by legislation. For all other fiscal years, the final contribution rate shall be the actuarially required contribution rate, provided that the final contribution rate shall not be less than the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b).

If the sum of the products of the number of years and fractional part of a year of credited service in each class and the appropriate class of service multiplier is greater than 16.667, the disability annuity shall be a single life annuity that is equal to the sum of the standard single life annuities determined separately for each class of service multiplied by the appropriate class of service multiplier, otherwise each standard single life annuity shall be multiplied by the lesser of the following ratios: MY*/Y or 16.667/Y Where Y = total number of years of credited service; Y* = total years of credited service if the member were to continue as a State employee until attaining superannuation age as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, or if the member has attained superannuation age, as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, then the number of years of credited service and M = the class of service multiplier as applicable to that class of service at the effective date of disability.

(c) Reduction on account of earned income.-- Subsequent to January 1, 1972, payments on account of disability shall be reduced by that amount by which the earned income of the annuitant, as reported in accordance with section 5908(b) (relating to rights and duties of annuitants), for the preceding calendar year together with the disability annuity payments provided in this section other than subsection (b), for the year, exceeds the product of: (1) the last year's salary of the annuitant as a member of the system; and (2) the ratio of the current monthly payment to the monthly payment at the effective date of disability; Provided, That the annuitant shall not receive less than his member's annuity or the amount to which he may be entitled under section 5702 whichever is greater. (d) Reduction on account of ineligibility.-- Payment of that portion of the disability annuity in excess of the annuity to which the annuitant was entitled at the effective date of disability calculated in accordance with section 5702 shall cease if the annuitant is no longer eligible under the provisions of sections 5905(c)(2) or 5908(b) or (c). (e) Termination of State service.-- Upon termination of disability annuity payments in excess of an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702, a disability annuitant who does not return to State service may file an application with the board for an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of the shared-risk accumulated deductions plus the regular and additional accumulated deductions standing to his credit at the effective date of disability over one-third of the total disability annuity payments received.

Such supplement shall continue as long as he is determined to be disabled and is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits on account of his service connected disability in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act or The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act. If the member has received a lump sum workers' compensation payment in lieu of future weekly compensation payments, the length in weeks and calculation of the service connected disability supplement shall be determined by dividing the lump sum payment by the average weekly wage as determined by the Workers' Compensation Board. (2) For a member who does not have Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be 70% of the member's final average salary. For a member who has Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be calculated according to the following formula: A = .7[(Y W MULTIPLIED BY FAS W )+(Y P MULTIPLIED BY FAS P )] Y T Y T (3) The following apply to the formula in paragraph (2): (i) A equals the amount used to determine the supplement; (ii) Y T equals total years of credited service; (iii) Y W equals years of credited service that are not Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (iv) FAS W equals final average salary calculated for credited service other than Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (v) Y P equals years of service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; and (vi) FAS P equals final average salary calculated for service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service.

      "text": "§ 5706. Termination of annuities. (a) General rule.-- (1) If the annuitant returns to State service or enters or has entered school service and elects multiple service membership, any annuity payable to him under this part shall cease effective upon the date of his return to State service or entering school service without regard to whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member of the system or participant in the plan or, if a multiple service member, whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member or participant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System or School Employees' Defined Contribution Plan; and, in the case of an annuity other than a disability annuity the present value of such annuity, adjusted for full coverage in the case of a joint coverage member who makes the appropriate back contributions for full coverage, shall be frozen as of the date such annuity ceases. An annuitant who is credited with an additional 10% of Class A and Class C service as provided in section 5302(c) (relating to credited State service) and who returns to State service shall forfeit such credited service and shall have his frozen present value adjusted as if his 10% retirement incentive had not been applied to his account. In the event that the cost-of-living increase enacted December 18, 1979 occurred during the period of such State or school employment, the frozen present value shall be increased, on or after the member attains superannuation age, by the percent applicable had he not returned to service. (2) This subsection shall not apply in the case of any annuitant who: (i) may render services to the Commonwealth in the capacity of an independent contractor; or (ii) is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year and who may render service to the Commonwealth: (A) as a member of an independent board or commission or as a member of a departmental administrative or advisory board or commission when such members of independent or departmental boards or commissions are compensated on a per diem basis for not more than 150 days per calendar year; or (B) as a member of an independent board or commission requiring appointment by the Governor, with advice and consent of the Senate, where the annual salary payable to the member does not exceed $35,000 and where the member has been an annuitant for at least six months immediately preceding the appointment. (a.1) Return to State service during emergency.-- When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public, an annuitant who is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year may be returned to State service for a period not to exceed 95 days in any calendar year without loss of his annuity. In computing the number of days an annuitant has returned to State service, any amount of time less than one-half of a day shall be counted as one-half of a day. For agencies, boards and commissions under the Governor's jurisdiction, the approval of the Governor that an emergency exists shall be required before an annuitant may be returned to State service. (a.2) Return of benefits.-- In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 5705 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to State service or entering school service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member or school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid. (a.3) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.-- In the event that a former State employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount so received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board, but not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave, with the repayment period not to exceed five years or such longer time as may be agreed to between the board and the member. (a.4) Return to service as a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of the act of September 30, 1983 (P.L.160, No.39), known as the Public Official Compensation Law, 42 Pa.C.S. (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure) or any other provision of law or rule of court providing for or allowing a member of the judiciary to return to service as a senior judge, senior justice, senior magisterial district judge or in any administrative, fact finding, adjudicative, appellate or other capacity with any court or tribunal or in any other capacity for which compensation is received and to receive such compensation, whether paid on a per diem, hourly, salaried or other basis, in addition to any annuity payable under this part, any such member of the judiciary who returns to State service shall be subject to the provision of this section and section 5301 (relating to mandatory and optional membership) unless that member of the judiciary is over normal retirement age or has been an annuitant for more than one year. (a.5) No contributions or credited service.-- The service of an annuitant whose annuity does not cease upon his return to State or school service shall not be subject to member contributions or eligible for qualification as creditable State service and shall not be eligible for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions, voluntary contributions or employer defined contributions. (b) Subsequent discontinuance of service.-- Upon subsequent discontinuance of service, such terminating State employee other than a former annuitant who had the effect of his frozen present value eliminated in accordance with subsection (c) or a former disability annuitant shall be entitled to an annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the present value as determined under subsection (a) to which shall be added, if the service after reemployment was as a member of the system, the present value of a maximum single life annuity based on years of service credited subsequent to reentry in the system and his final average salary computed by reference to his compensation as a member of the system or as a member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System during his entire period of State and school service. (c) Elimination of the effect of frozen present value.-- (1) An annuitant who returns to State service as an active member of the system and earns three eligibility points as a member of the system by performing credited State service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, or an annuitant who enters school service other than as a Class DC participant and: (i) is a multiple service member; or (ii) who elects multiple service membership, and earns three eligibility points by performing credited State service as a member of the system or credited school service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, and who had the present value of his annuity frozen in accordance with subsection (a), shall qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value resulting from all previous periods of retirement eliminated, provided that all lump sum payments under Option 4 or under section 5705(a.1) and annuity payments payable during previous periods of retirement plus interest as set forth in paragraph (3) shall be returned to the fund in the form of an actuarial adjustment to his subsequent benefits or in such form as the board may otherwise direct. (2) Upon subsequent discontinuance of service and the filing of an application for an annuity, a former annuitant who qualifies to have the effect of a frozen present value eliminated under this subsection shall be entitled to receive the higher of either: (i) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the freezing of the former annuitant's account pursuant to subsection (a) had not occurred, adjusted by crediting Class A State service as Class AA service as provided for in section 5306(a.1) (relating to classes of service) and further adjusted according to paragraph (3), provided that a former annuitant of the system or a former annuitant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System who retired under a provision of law granting additional service credit if termination of State or school service or retirement occurred during a specific period of time shall not be permitted to retain the additional service credit under the prior law when the annuity is computed for his most recent retirement; or (ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value eliminated, unless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity. (3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement. The interest for each year shall be calculated based upon the annual interest rate adopted for that fiscal year by the board for the calculation of the normal contribution rate pursuant to section 5508(b) (relating to actuarial cost method).

For purposes of this subsection, a member with Class A-5 service or Class A-6 service who has ten or more eligibility points shall be considered eligible for an annuity based on Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, subject to a reduction factor calculated to provide benefits actuarially equivalent to an annuity starting at superannuation age, even if the member had not attained age 62.

(a) Vehicles generally.-- (1) A vehicle may not be operated as a taxicab with citywide call or demand rights in cities of the first class unless a certificate of public convenience is issued by the authority authorizing the operation of the taxicab and a medallion is attached to the hood of the vehicle. Prior to the issuance of a medallion, the certificate holder shall have its vehicle inspected by the authority. (2) The authority shall require, by order or regulation, that each vehicle within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter submit to periodic inspections by authority personnel to ensure that the vehicle meets the requirements of this subchapter and authority regulations. (3) Authority inspection requirements for vehicles within its jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to the vehicle requirements set forth in Title 75 (relating to vehicles) and may include vehicle age and mileage limitations. Authority inspection and recording requirements shall be established by regulations. (4) No vehicle which is more than eight years old shall continue in operation as a taxicab. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority may authorize the operation of antique vehicles in call or demand service in such circumstances as the authority may deem appropriate. (5) Each taxicab certificate holder's tariff rates shall be clearly and visibly displayed in each taxicab. (6) A medallion shall not be removed from a vehicle without prior notification to and permission of the authority. (7) A medallion authorizes operation of a vehicle as a taxicab only for the fiscal year for which the medallion is issued. (b) Driver security devices.-- Each vehicle authorized to provide taxicab service shall be equipped with such security devices as the authority may, in its discretion, require by order or regulation. (c) Service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon call or demand and parcels, packages and property at the same basic metered rates charged to passengers: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its centralized dispatch system; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as a continuous part of a trip. (d) Other vehicles.-- (1) A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate to provide call or demand service within cities of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission authorizing call or demand service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and property: (i) to cities of the first class in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (ii) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond that city of the first class if the request for service for such transportation is received by call to its radio dispatch service.

The authority shall not grant additional rights to new or existing carriers to serve designated areas within cities of the first class on a non-citywide basis. (e) Penalties involving certificated taxicabs.-- Operating a certificated taxicab in violation of subsections (a) and (b) or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders of subsections (a) and (b) may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725 (relating to civil penalties). (f) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a taxicab, or giving the appearance of offering call or demand service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience and a medallion is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each offense thereafter. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as or appearing as a taxicab without a certificate of public convenience and a medallion are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (g) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) The authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles, medallions and equipment which are utilized to provide call or demand service in cities of the first class without a proper certificate of public convenience issued by the authority or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and payment of the costs of the authority associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle, medallion and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment.

      "text": "§ 5741. Certificate of public convenience required. (a) General rule.-- In order to operate a limousine service within a city of the first class, the limousine service must have a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority under section 5741.1 (relating to power of authority). The authority may grant a certificate of public convenience to provide limousine service if the authority determines that the applicant is capable of providing safe, adequate, lawful and dependable service to the public. The authority may by regulation define categories of limousine service. The authority may separately grant certificates of public convenience for each category of limousine service and specify the rights associated with the certificates of public convenience by category of limousine service. (a.1) Advance reservation limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service within a city of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon advance reservation: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate issued; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as part of a continuous trip. (a.2) Other limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide nonexclusive, scheduled limousine service may transport persons and their baggage to or from any airport, railroad station or hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class without advance reservation in accordance with rules and regulations established by the authority. (a.3) Commission limousine certificate holders.-- A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service in a city of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the commission authorizing limousine service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and their baggage: (1) to a city of the first class upon advance reservation and in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (2) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond the city of the first class upon advance reservation in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience, excluding service from any airport, railroad station and hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class. (b) Enforcement.-- (1) The provisions of this subchapter and the rules and regulations promulgated by the authority pursuant to this subchapter shall be enforced within cities of the first class by authority personnel. (2) The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission may initiate actions before the authority. (c) Restrictions.-- (1) Certificates issued pursuant to this subchapter shall be nontransferable unless a transfer is approved by the authority. (2) A limousine service provider operating pursuant to an authority-issued certificate of public convenience and a filed tariff permitting the limousine service provider to charge mileage-based rates on the effective date of this paragraph shall be permitted to continue to charge mileage-based rates and to be regulated in the same manner as traditional limousine service providers. (d) Penalties involving certified limousines.-- Operating a certificated limousine in violation of this subchapter and authority regulations with regard to limousine service in a city of the first class or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745 (relating to civil penalties). (e) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a limousine or giving the appearance of offering limousine service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience, is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each subsequent offense. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as a limousine without a certificate of public convenience are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (f) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) In addition to penalties provided for in subsections (d) and (e), the authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles and equipment which are utilized to provide limousine service without a proper certificate of public convenience in a city of the first class or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and equipment and payment of the authority's costs associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction. (ii) To all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner and operator of the confiscated property. (iii) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the lien of any registered lienholder of the confiscated property upon demand. (iv) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the registered owner of the confiscated property upon demand. (v) When not claimed by any registered lienholder or registered owner within one year of the auction date, remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the fund. (f.1) Assessment.-- After application of the proceeds from the sale of confiscated property under subsection (f), the uncompensated costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction and all outstanding penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property may be assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property as the authority may prescribe by regulation.

(4) A civil penalty may not be assessed and a license suspension or revocation may not be imposed against a third-party surety for any of the following: (i) Failure to report a known violation under subsection (a), if the third-party surety provides evidence that the violation was reported to a law enforcement agency under subsection (b). (ii) Lack of knowledge of the bail conditions, if the third-party surety provides evidence that the third-party surety attempted to obtain information about the bail conditions which went unanswered or refused or that the bail conditions were altered subsequent to the defendant's release and the third-party surety lacked information about the amended conditions. (iii) Willful disregard to the safety of a witness, victim or the general public, if: (A) the third-party surety provides evidence that the third-party surety reviewed the bail conditions with the defendant within 24 hours of release and during instances of contact between the third-party surety and the defendant; and (B) if the defendant indicated a willingness to commit a violation under subsection (a), the third-party surety reported the risk to the attorney for the Commonwealth or the law enforcement agency, if the attorney for the Commonwealth is unavailable.

(a) General rule.-- If a nonprofit corporation or the board of directors receives a demand to bring an action to enforce a right of the corporation, or if a derivative action is commenced before demand has been made on the corporation or the board, the board may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the demand or action and to determine on behalf of the corporation or recommend to the board whether pursuing any of the claims asserted is in the best interests of the corporation. The corporation must deliver a notice in record form to the person making the demand, or to the plaintiff if a derivative action has been commenced, promptly after the appointment of a committee under this section notifying the person making the demand or the plaintiff that a committee has been appointed and identifying by name the members of the committee. (b) Discovery stay.-- If the board of directors appoints a special litigation committee and an action is commenced before a determination has been made under subsection (e): (1) On motion by the nonprofit corporation, or the committee made in the name of the corporation, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to complete its investigation, except for good cause shown. (2) The time for the defendants to plead shall be tolled until the process provided for under subsection (f) has been completed. (c) Composition of committee.-- A special litigation committee shall be composed of two or more individuals who: (1) are not interested in the claims asserted in the demand or action; (2) are capable as a group of objective judgment in the circumstances; and (3) may, but need not, be members, directors or members of an other body. (c.1) Committee members who are not directors or members of an other body.-- A member of a special litigation committee who is not a director or member of an other body, when acting as a member of the committee, is subject to the liabilities imposed, and entitled to the rights and immunities conferred by Subchapters B (relating to fiduciary duty) and D (relating to indemnification) and other provisions of law upon directors of a corporation. (d) Appointment of committee.-- A special litigation committee may be appointed: (1) by a majority of the directors not named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action; or (2) if all the directors are named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action, by a majority of: (i) the members of an other body not named as parties in the proceeding if the other body has the authority to appoint a special litigation committee; or (ii) the directors so named. (e) Determination.-- After appropriate investigation by a special litigation committee, the committee may determine, or the committee may recommend to the board of directors that the board determine that it is in the best interests of the nonprofit corporation that: (1) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand not be brought by the corporation but that the corporation not object to an action being brought by the party that made the demand; (2) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be brought by the corporation; (3) some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; (4) an action not be brought based on any of the claims asserted in the demand; (5) an action already commenced continue under the control of: (i) the plaintiff; (ii) the corporation; or (iii) the committee; (6) some or all the claims asserted in an action already commenced be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; or (7) an action already commenced be dismissed. (f) Court review and action.-- If a special litigation committee is appointed and a derivative action is commenced before or after the committee makes a determination under subsection (e) or the board of directors determines under subsection (e) to accept the recommendation of the committee: (1) The nonprofit corporation or the committee shall file with the court after a determination is made under subsection (e) a statement of the determination and a report of the committee supporting the determination. The corporation or the committee shall serve each party with a copy of the determination and report. If the corporation or the committee moves to file the report under seal, the report shall be served on the parties subject to an appropriate stipulation agreed to by the parties or a protective order issued by the court. (2) The corporation or the committee shall file with the court a motion, pleading or notice consistent with the determination under subsection (e). (3) If the determination is one described in subsection (e)(2), (3), (4), (5)(ii), (6) or (7), the court shall determine whether the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its determination or recommendation in good faith, independently and with reasonable care. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the committee did not meet those qualifications or act in the required manner. If the court finds that the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and that the committee acted in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee or the board. Otherwise, the court shall: (i) dissolve any stay of discovery entered under subsection (b); (ii) allow the action to continue under the control of the plaintiff; and (iii) permit the defendants to file preliminary objections, other appropriate pleadings and motions. (g) Attorney General.-- Nothing in this section limits the rights, powers and duties of the Attorney General under other applicable law with respect to a nonprofit corporation. (h) Interest of a defendant.-- The fact that a person is named as a defendant does not make the person interested in the claims asserted in a demand or action for purposes of subsection (c)(1) if the claims against the person: (1) are based only on an allegation that the person approved of or acquiesced in the transaction or conduct that is the subject of the claims; and (2) do not otherwise allege with particularity facts that, if true, raise a significant prospect that the person would be adjudged liable.

Each joint airport zoning board shall have as members two representatives appointed by each municipality participating in its creation and, in addition, a chairman elected by a majority of the members so appointed.

Any variance may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions that the board may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter. (c) Hazard marking and lighting.-- In granting any permit or variance under this section, the board shall, if it deems the action advisable to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter and reasonable in the circumstances, so condition the permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person or persons requesting the permit or variance, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be required by guidelines or regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States Department of Transportation.

(2) (i) Rights under this part shall be subject to forfeiture as provided by the act of July 8, 1978 (P.L.752, No.140), known as the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act, and by or pursuant to section 16(b) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. Forfeitures under this subsection or under any other provision of law may not be applied to increase the benefits that any member would otherwise receive under this part. (ii) In accordance with section 16(b) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and notwithstanding this paragraph, the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act, or 42 Pa.C.S. § 3352 (relating to pension rights), the accumulated mandatory participant contributions and accumulated voluntary contributions standing to the credit of a participant shall not be forfeited but shall be available for payment of fines and restitution as provided by law. In accordance with section 16(b) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, amounts in the trust that have been ordered to be distributed to an alternate payee as the result of an equitable distribution of marital property as part of an approved domestic relations order entered before the date of the order or action in a court or other tribunal resulting in a forfeiture of a participant's interest in the trust shall not be subject to the provisions of the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act or 42 Pa.C.S. § 3352.

(3) Rights under this part shall be subject to attachment in favor of an alternate payee as set forth in an approved domestic relations order. (4) Effective with distributions made on or after January 1, 1993, and notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan by way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this paragraph, a \"distributee\" includes a member, a participant, a member's surviving spouse, a participant's surviving spouse, a member's former spouse who is an alternate payee under an approved domestic relations order, a participant's former spouse who is an alternate payee under an approved domestic relations order and anyone else authorized under the IRC and the plan terms approved by the board to have an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan by way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"eligible rollover distribution\" has the meaning given such term by IRC § 402(f)(2)(A), and \"eligible retirement plan\" has the meaning given such term by IRC § 402(c)(8)(B), except that a qualified trust shall be considered an eligible retirement plan only if it accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution; however, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an \"individual retirement account\" or an \"individual retirement annuity\" as those terms are defined in IRC § 408(a) and (b). (b) Authorized payments from fund and trust.-- (1) The board shall be authorized to pay from the fund and the trust in the case of a member or participant who is terminating service, the amount determined after certification by the head of the department that the member or participant is so obligated, and after review and approval by the department or agency's legal representative or upon receipt of an assignment from the member or participant in the amount so certified, except that no payment shall be made from the individual investment account of a participant until the participant otherwise applies for and receives a distribution and shall not exceed the amount of the distribution. (2) In the case of a participant whose former spouse is an alternate payee of an equitable distribution of marital assets under an approved domestic relations order, a lump sum of the alternate payee's interest in the participant's vested accumulated total defined contributions. This paragraph shall apply without regard to whether the participant has not terminated, is terminating or has terminated State service.

(2) Any service other than service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police performed by a State employee eligible for a benefit under the binding arbitration under paragraph (1) shall be used to determine benefits as provided in this part in addition to any benefit an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police is eligible to receive under the binding arbitration award as set forth in this subsection. (3) The following shall apply: (i) The eligibility for and calculation of pension or retirement benefits or rights under the binding arbitration award of a State employee who first becomes a State police officer on or after January 1, 2019, and before the effective date of section 5306.6 and who makes the election under section 5306.6, or who first becomes a State police officer on or after the effective date of section 5306.6, shall be determined using only service performed and compensation and eligibility points earned: (A) as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police; (B) while on USERRA leave from service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police; or (C) from creditable nonstate service purchased under section 5304(c)(2) (relating to creditable nonstate service) while an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police. (ii) Service credit and eligibility points for service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police shall be adjusted for any other concurrent service as a State employee. (iii) Any service, other than the following, purchased or performed by a State employee eligible for a benefit under the binding arbitration award shall be used to determine benefits as provided under this part in addition to any benefit an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police is eligible to receive under the binding arbitration award as provided under this subsection: (A) Creditable nonstate service purchased under section 5304(c)(2) while an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police. (B) Service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police. (4) A State employee who meets either of the following and who terminates State service on or after January 1, 2019, shall be eligible to receive a maximum single life annuity before optional modification under section 5705 (relating to member's options) equal to the maximum single life annuity that the State employee is eligible to receive under this part attributable to all credited service, compensation and eligibility points: (i) First becomes a State police officer on or after January 1, 2019, and before the effective date of section 5306.6 and who did not make the election under section 5306.6 who does not have 20 or more eligibility points as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police or from USERRA leave from service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police. (ii) First becomes a State police officer on or after January 1, 2019, and who made the election under section 5306.6, or who first becomes a State police officer on or after the effective date of section 5306.6 who does not have 20 or more eligibility points as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police or from USERRA leave from service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police or from creditable nonstate service purchased under section 5304(c)(2). (5) Except as otherwise provided under this part, service as a State police officer credited in the system shall not operate to prevent any State employee from being a participant in the plan for any State service that is not service as a Class A-5 exempt employee that would otherwise result in participation in the plan. Any benefit resulting from participation in the plan shall be in addition to any benefit a State police officer may be eligible to receive as a member of the system. (6) As used in this subsection, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this paragraph unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Binding arbitration award.\" A binding arbitration award issued before July 1, 1989, under the Policemen and Firemen Collective Bargaining Act, and implemented by the board.

(1) Local authorities shall obtain approval of the department prior to erecting an official traffic-control device on a State-designated highway except where department regulations provide otherwise. (2) Local authorities shall obtain approval of the department prior to erecting any traffic signal except in a municipality with a traffic engineer qualified in accordance with department regulations. (b) Standards for department approval.-- The department shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth minimum standards and factors to be considered in determining whether approval shall be given by the department for the installation and maintenance of official traffic-control devices. The factors shall include, but not be limited to, the volume of traffic and the number of accidents that occurred in each of the three preceding years. (c) Agreements to waive department approval.-- The department may enter into agreements with local authorities transferring to them the authority to install official traffic-control devices without specific State approval provided they conduct traffic and engineering investigations which conform with the rules and regulations promulgated by the department. (d) Signals on municipal boundaries.-- Whenever the need arises for the installation of a traffic-control signal on or near the boundary of two political subdivisions adjoining each other so as to be beneficial to both, either may petition the department for authority to install the signal. If the political subdivisions cannot amicably agree upon an allocation of the costs of installation and maintenance of the signal, either may petition the court of common pleas of the county in which the traffic-control signal is to be installed within 90 days after receiving the approval of the department and the court shall determine the proper allocation of the expenses to be incurred. The political subdivision that originated the request to the department shall install the traffic-control signal within 90 days of the date of the court order or of an amicable agreement between the political subdivisions.",

(a) Imposition.-- There is hereby imposed, effective July 1, 1984, a State tax of 1.1¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, on all fuels used or sold and delivered by distributors within this Commonwealth for use as fuel in turbine-propeller jet, turbojet and jet-driven aircraft and aircraft engines. The tax shall be increased by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective January 1, 1985, and by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective July 1, 1985. Distributors shall be liable to the Commonwealth for the collection and payment of the tax imposed by this section. The tax shall be collected by the distributor and shall be paid to the Commonwealth only once with respect to any fuels. (b) Annual adjustment.-- Beginning on January 1, 1986, and each January 1 thereafter, the tax imposed under this section shall be adjusted annually and shall be set for that calendar year. The adjustment shall be based upon the percentage change of the Producer Price Index for Jet Fuel, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States Department of Labor, for the most recent 12-month period available as of the immediately preceding November 1. For every 10% increase or decrease in the Producer Price Index, as determined by comparing the index for the first month of the 12-month period with the index for the last month of the period, there shall be a 0.1¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, increase or decrease in the rate of tax. The rate of tax shall be determined by the Secretary of Revenue, who shall cause such rate to be published as a notice pursuant to 45 Pa.C.S. § 725(a)(3) (relating to additional contents of Pennsylvania Bulletin) in the Pennsylvania Bulletin on or before December 15 of each year. The tax, as adjusted, shall never exceed 2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, nor shall it be less than 1.5¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof. (c) Construction of section.-- This section shall be construed in conjunction with the act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, as if jet fuels were liquid fuels as defined in that act, and all of the provisions of that act, except for section 4 thereof to the extent it imposes any tax, shall apply to the collection, administration and enforcement of the tax imposed under this section. Upon the effective date of the tax imposed by this section upon jet fuels, such jet fuels shall not be subject to the tax imposed by the act of January 14, 1952 (1951 P.L.1965, No.550), known as the Fuel Use Tax Act, except that dealer-users shall remain liable to report and pay the fuel use tax on any jet fuels used thereafter upon which the tax provided by this section has not been imposed. (d) Disposition of taxes.-- All moneys collected under this section shall be deposited by the State Treasurer in the Aviation Restricted Account. Effective Date of Tax. Section 4 of Act 164 of 1984 provided that, if Act 164 was not finally enacted on or before July 1, 1984, the tax imposed under section 6131 shall not be effective as of July 1, 1984, but shall be effective on the first day of the first month following final enactment (November 1, 1984). References in Text. The act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, referred to in subsec. (c), was repealed by the act of April 17, 1997 (P.L.6, No.3). The subject matter is now contained in Chapter 90 of Title 75 (relating to liquid fuels and fuels tax). The act of January 14, 1952 (1951 P.L.1965, No.550), known as the Fuel Use Tax Act, referred to in subsec. (c), was repealed by the act of April 17, 1997 (P.L.6, No.3).

The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had.

(d) \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution. (e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including, but not limited to, a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined. ARTICLE III Contracts (a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration. 2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance. 3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any, the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom. 4. Delivery and retaking of inmates. 5. Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states. (b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith. ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights (a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. (b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. (c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III. (d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state. (e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state. (f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. (g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory. (h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state. (i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact. ARTICLE V Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition (a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference. (b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VI Federal Aid Any state party to this compact may accept Federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such Federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provisions, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor. ARTICLE VII Entry into Force This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states.

ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact. ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements. ARTICLE X Construction and Severability The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",

The following interpleader compact is hereby approved, ratified, adopted and entered into by this Commonwealth as a party to take effect between this Commonwealth and any other state of the United States of America when entered into in accordance with the terms of the compact by the other state and not disapproved by the Governor under paragraph (c) of Article 7 of the compact: The Interpleader Compact The contracting states solemnly agree: Article 1. Purpose.--The aims of this compact are to promote comity and judicial cooperation among the states party thereto; and to relieve from undue risk and uncertainty, a person who may be subject to double or multiple liability because of the existence of adverse claimants, one or more of whom in the absence of this compact may not be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudicating court, when such person makes all reasonable efforts to secure judicial determination and discharge of his liability. Article 2. Definitions.--For the purpose of this compact the following definitions shall apply: (a) A state shall mean (1) a state of the United States or any territory or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia acting under Article 1, section 10, clause 3, of the Constitution of the United States in entering this compact with an American or a foreign jurisdiction, or (2) a state of the community of nations and any component governmental unit of such a state which under the laws thereof may validly become party to this compact. (b) A person shall include any entity capable of suing or being sued in the state in which the interpleader is pending. (c) Interpleader shall mean a judicial procedure by which two or more persons who have adverse claims against a third person may be required to litigate these claims in one proceeding. Article 3. Service of process.--(a) Service of process sufficient to acquire personal jurisdiction may be made within a state party to this compact, by a person who institutes an interpleader proceeding or interpleader part of a proceeding in another state, party to this compact, provided that such service shall fulfill the requirements for service of process of the state in which the service is made and provided further that such service shall meet the minimum standards for service of the jurisdiction where the proceeding is pending. (b) No such service of process shall be valid unless either: (1) The subject matter of the proceeding is specific real property or tangible personal property situated within the state in which the proceeding is pending; or (2) One or more of the claimants shall be either a permanent resident or domiciliary of the state in which the proceeding is pending; or (3) A significant portion of the transaction out of which the proceeding shall have arisen shall have taken place in the state in which the proceeding is pending; or (4) One of the claimants shall have initiated the action. Article 4. Scope of interpleader unaffected.--Nothing in this compact shall be construed to change any requirement or limitation on the scope of interpleader of the state in which the interpleader proceeding is pending except in relation to acquisition of personal jurisdiction. Article 5. Finality of judgment.--No judgment obtained against any person in any proceeding to which he had become a party by reason of service of process effected pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be subject to attack on the ground that the adjudicating court did not have personal jurisdiction over such person. Article 6. Enactment.--(a) This compact shall enter into force and effect as to a state one year from the date it has taken whatever action may be necessary pursuant to its required processes to make this compact part of the laws of such state and the appropriate authority of such state shall have deposited a duly authenticated copy of its statute, proclamation, order, or similar official pronouncement having the force of law and embodying this compact as law with the appropriate officer or agency of each of the states party thereto. In the statute, proclamation, order, or similar act by which a state adopts this compact, it shall specify the officer or agency with whom the documents referred to in this article shall be deposited. (b) Unless the statute, proclamation, order, or similar act by which a state adopts this compact shall specify otherwise, and name the states with which the state intends to compact, such adoption shall apply to all other states then party to or who may subsequently become party to this compact. In the event that a state shall enter this compact with some states but not with others, the deposit of documents required by paragraph (a) of this article shall be effected only with those states to which the adopting state specifies an intention to be bound. Article 7. Withdrawal.--(a) This compact shall continue in force and remain binding on a party state until such state shall withdraw therefrom. To be valid and effective, any withdrawal must be preceded by a formal notice in writing of one year from the appropriate authority of that state. Such notice shall be communicated to the same officer or agency in each party state with which the notice of adoption was deposited pursuant to Article 6 of this compact. In the event that a state wishes to withdraw with respect to one or more states, but wishes to remain a party to this compact with other states party thereto, its notice of withdrawal shall be communicated only to those states with respect to which withdrawal is contemplated. (b) Withdrawal shall not be effective as to service of process accomplished pursuant to this compact prior to the actual date of withdrawal. (c) Any state receiving a notice of adoption from another state may by action of its executive head within a year from the receipt of such notice in the manner provided for withdrawal in paragraph (a) of this article specify its intention not to be bound to the state depositing such notice and such adoption thereupon shall not be binding upon the state so acting. Article 8. Severability and construction.--The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, or in the case of a component governmental unit, to the constitution of the state of which it is a part, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby; provided that if this compact shall be held invalid or contrary to the constitution of any government participating therein the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining governments and in full force and effect as to the government affected as to all severable matters. It is the intent that the provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed.",

An electric cooperative corporation may only supply retail broadband services through one or more affiliates. (2) Except as provided for under subsection (b), the attachment of broadband facilities shall not constitute a change to the physical use of the easement, interfere with or impair any vested rights of the property owner subject to the easement or place an additional burden on the property or interests of the owner. (3) A broadband service supplier that is not an electric cooperative corporation may access and attach broadband facilities within an electric cooperative corporation's easement: (i) if an electric cooperative corporation or its affiliates have attached broadband facilities to provide retail or wholesale broadband services or if an electric cooperative corporation, in its sole discretion, gives express written permission to a broadband service supplier to utilize an existing electric easement; and (ii) subject to the terms of applicable safety standards, the structural integrity of the electric infrastructure and the electric cooperative corporation's rules and fees for the attachments. (4) An electric cooperative corporation that elects to provide retail broadband services, through an affiliate, as a broadband service supplier shall permit other suppliers of such services nondiscriminatory access to attach to electric infrastructure, owned or controlled by the electric cooperative corporation, pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions comparable to and no less favorable than those offered to an affiliate of an electric cooperative corporation engaged in the provision of retail broadband services. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit, amend, supersede or otherwise alter the rates, terms and conditions established under existing written attachment agreements for the term of such agreements except as provided under subparagraph (iii). The following shall apply: (i) Except as provided under subparagraph (ii), an electric cooperative corporation shall provide written notice, by first class mail, to any broadband service supplier with which it has an existing written agreement governing the broadband service supplier's attachments to electric infrastructure owned or controlled by the electric cooperative corporation within 90 days of the date on which an electric cooperative corporation's affiliate begins offering retail broadband services over broadband facilities. (ii) An electric cooperative corporation that is providing retail broadband service through an affiliate as of the effective date of this section shall not be required to send the notice required under subparagraph (i). (iii) For a period of five years from receipt of the notice required under subparagraph (i), or from the effective date of this section if subparagraph (ii) applies, a broadband service supplier that has an existing written attachment agreement with an electric cooperative corporation shall have the right to attach to the poles of that electric cooperative corporation at rates that shall not exceed the then-effective rates in the existing agreement, subject to permissible periodic rate adjustments provided in the existing agreement. (5) An electric cooperative corporation may not do any of the following: (i) require a person to purchase broadband services from an affiliate of the electric cooperative corporation as a condition of receiving or continuing to receive electric energy from the electric cooperative corporation; or (ii) disconnect, or threaten to disconnect, electric service to a customer due to the customer's failure to pay for broadband services provided to the customer by the electric cooperative corporation or an affiliate. (b) Applicability.-- Except for the replacement or relocation of existing poles or as otherwise provided by law, subsection (a)(2) shall not apply to the attachment of broadband facilities that are additional freestanding or ground-based structures within the easement. (c) Cross-subsidization.-- The following shall apply: (1) An electric cooperative corporation that supplies retail broadband services through an affiliate shall ensure that the rates charged for the provision of electric service do not include any of its affiliate's retail broadband service costs and shall not use its electric service revenues to subsidize the provision of retail broadband services to the public by an affiliate. (2) An electric cooperative corporation may make capital investments in an affiliate, make loans for the benefit of an affiliate, enter into capital or operating leases with an affiliate and enter into guarantees or other security arrangements for the benefit of an affiliate, all of which may be in amounts, on terms and subject to conditions as the electric cooperative corporation's board of directors approves and determines to be prudent or appropriate. (d) Construction.-- Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall limit any of the rights that exist under the laws of this Commonwealth of any broadband service supplier to secure its own easements for the construction or installation of broadband facilities or the provision of broadband services or to negotiate separate terms or agreements for attachments to electric infrastructure, owned or controlled by an electric cooperative corporation.",

      "text": "§ 8221. Annual registration. (a) General rule.-- Every domestic limited liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership in existence on December 31 of any year and every foreign limited liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership that is registered to do business in this Commonwealth on December 31 of any year shall deliver to the Department of State for filing with respect to that year, and on or before April 15 of the following year, a certificate of annual registration on a form provided by the department, signed by a general partner and accompanied by the annual registration fee prescribed by subsection (b). The department shall not charge a fee other than the annual registration fee for filing the certificate of annual registration. (b) Annual registration fee.-- (1) The annual registration fee to be paid when filing a certificate of annual registration shall be equal to a base fee of $200 times the number of persons who were general partners of the partnership on December 31 of the year with respect to which the certificate of annual registration is being filed and who: (i) in the case of a natural person, had his principal residence on that date in this Commonwealth; or (ii) in the case of any other person, was incorporated or otherwise organized or existing on that date under the laws of this Commonwealth. (2) The base fee of $200 shall be increased on December 31, 1997, and December 31 of every third year thereafter by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Workers during the most recent three calendar years for which that index is available on the date of adjustment. Each adjustment under this paragraph shall be rounded up to the nearest $10. (c) Notice of annual registration.-- Not later than February 1 of each year, the department shall give notice to every partnership required to file a certificate of annual registration with respect to the preceding year of the requirement to file the certificate. The notice shall state the amount of the base fee payable under subsection (b)(1), as adjusted pursuant to subsection (b)(2), if applicable, and shall be accompanied by the form of certificate of annual registration to be filed. Failure by the department to give notice to any party, or failure by any party to receive notice, of the annual registration requirement shall not relieve the party of the obligation to file the certificate of annual registration. (d) Credit to Corporation Bureau Restricted Account.-- The annual registration fee shall not be deemed to be an amount received by the department under Subchapter C of Chapter 1 for purposes of section 155 (relating to disposition of funds), except that $25 of the fee shall be credited to the Corporation Bureau Restricted Account. (e) Failure to file or pay annual fee.-- (1) Failure to file the certificate of annual registration required by this section for five consecutive years shall result in the automatic termination of: (i) the status of the limited liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership as such, if it is a domestic partnership; or (ii) the registration of the limited liability partnership or limited liability limited partnership, if it is a foreign partnership. (1.1) Any annual registration fee that is not paid when due shall be a lien in the manner provided in this subsection from the time the annual registration fee is due and payable. If a certificate of annual registration is not filed within 30 days after the date on which it is due, the department shall assess a penalty of $500 against the partnership, which shall also be a lien in the manner provided in this subsection. The imposition of that penalty shall not be construed to relieve the partnership from liability for any other penalty or interest provided for under other applicable law. (2) If the annual registration fee paid by a partnership is subsequently determined to be less than should have been paid because it was based on an incorrect number of general partners or was otherwise incorrectly computed, that fact shall not affect the existence, status or foreign registration of the partnership, but the amount of the additional annual registration fee that should have been paid shall be a lien in the manner provided in this subsection from the time the incorrect payment is discovered by the department. (3) The annual registration fee shall bear simple interest from the date that it becomes due and payable until paid. The interest rate shall be that provided for in section 806 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code, with respect to unpaid taxes. The penalty provided for in paragraph (1) shall not bear interest. The payment of interest shall not relieve the partnership from liability for any other penalty or interest provided for under other applicable law. (4) The lien created by this subsection shall attach to all of the property and proceeds thereof of the partnership in which a security interest can be perfected in whole or in part by filing in the department under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9 (relating to secured transactions; sales of accounts, contract rights and chattel paper), whether the property and proceeds are owned by the partnership at the time the annual registration fee or any penalty or interest becomes due and payable or whether the property and proceeds are acquired thereafter. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the lien created by this subsection shall have priority over all other liens, security interests or other charges, except liens for taxes or other charges due the Commonwealth. The lien created by this subsection shall be entered on the records of the department and indexed in the same manner as a financing statement filed under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9. At the time an annual registration fee, penalty or interest that has resulted in the creation of a lien under this subsection is paid, the department shall terminate the lien with respect to that annual registration fee, penalty or interest without requiring a separate filing by the partnership for that purpose. (5) If the annual registration fee paid by a partnership is subsequently determined to be more than should have been paid for any reason, no refund of the additional fee shall be made. (6) Termination of the status or foreign registration of a partnership under this section, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, shall not release it from the obligation to pay any accrued fees, penalties and interest and shall not release the lien created by this subsection. (f) Exception for bankrupt partnerships.-- A partnership that would otherwise be required to pay the annual registration fee set forth in subsection (b) shall not be required to pay that fee with respect to any year during any part of which the partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy. The partnership shall, instead, indicate on its certificate of annual registration for that year that it is exempt from payment of the annual registration fee pursuant to this subsection. If the partnership fails to file timely a certificate of annual registration, a lien shall be entered on the records of the department pursuant to subsection (e) which shall not be removed until the partnership files a certificate of annual registration indicating its entitlement to an exemption from payment of the annual registration fee as provided in this subsection. See section 8201(e) (relating to scope). (June 22, 2001, P.L.418, No.34, eff. 60 days; Nov. 21, 2016, P.L.1328, No.170, eff. 90 days) References in Text.

(d) Duty of partners.-- The duty to furnish information under subsection (c) also applies to each partner to the extent the partner knows any of the information described in subsection (c). (e) Rights after dissociation.-- Subject to subsection (j), within 10 days after receipt by a partnership of a demand made in record form, a person dissociated as a partner may have access to information to which the person was entitled while a partner if: (1) the information pertains to the period during which the person was a partner; (2) the person seeks the information in good faith; and (3) the information is material to the person's rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this title.

The court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether or not the person seeking inspection is entitled to the inspection sought.

(a) General rule.-- A partner owes to the partnership and the other partners the duties of loyalty and care stated in subsections (b) and (c). (b) Duty of loyalty.-- The fiduciary duty of loyalty of a partner includes the duties: (1) to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the partner: (i) in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's business; (ii) from a use by the partner of the partnership's property; or (iii) from the appropriation of a partnership opportunity; (2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business as or on behalf of a person having an interest adverse to the partnership; and (3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership's business before the dissolution of the partnership. (c) Duty of care.-- The duty of care of a partner in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business is to refrain from engaging in gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or a knowing violation of law. (d) Good faith and fair dealing.-- A partner shall discharge the duties and obligations under this title or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistent with the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (e) Self-serving conduct.-- A partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this title or under the partnership agreement solely because the partner's conduct furthers the partner's own interest. (f) Authorization or ratification.-- All the partners may authorize or ratify, after disclosure of all material facts, a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty of a partner. (g) Fairness as a defense.-- It is a defense to a claim under subsection (b)(2) and any comparable claim in equity or at common law that the transaction was fair to the partnership at the time it was authorized or ratified under subsection (f). (h) Rights and obligations in approved transaction.-- If a partner enters into a transaction with the partnership which otherwise would be prohibited under subsection (b)(2), but the transaction is authorized or ratified as provided under subsection (f) or the partnership agreement, the partner's rights and obligations arising from the transaction are the same as those of a person that is not a partner. (i) Exoneration.-- The partnership agreement may provide that a partner shall not be personally liable for monetary damages to the partnership or the other partners for a breach of subsection (c), except that a partner may not be exonerated for an act that constitutes recklessness, willful misconduct or a knowing violation of law.

(a) General rule.-- A transfer, in whole or in part, of a transferable interest: (1) is permissible; (2) does not by itself cause the dissociation of the transferor as a partner or a dissolution and winding up of the partnership's business; and (3) subject to section 8455 (relating to power of personal representative of deceased partner), does not entitle the transferee to: (i) participate in the management or conduct of the partnership's business; or (ii) except as provided in subsection (c), have access to records or other information concerning the partnership's business. (b) Rights of transferee.-- A transferee has the right to: (1) receive, in accordance with the terms of the transfer: (i) distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled; and (ii) allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit or similar item which would otherwise be made to the transferor; and (2) seek under section 8481(a)(5) (relating to events causing dissolution) a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership business. (c) Right to account on dissolution.-- In a dissolution and winding up of a partnership, a transferee is entitled to an account of the partnership's transactions only from the date of dissolution. (d) Recognition of transferee's rights.-- A partnership need not give effect to a transferee's rights under this section until the partnership knows or has notice of the transfer. (e) Transfer restrictions.-- A transfer of a transferable interest in violation of a restriction on transfer contained in the partnership agreement is ineffective if the intended transferee has knowledge or notice of the restriction at the time of transfer. (f) Rights retained by transferor.-- Except as provided in section 8461(4)(ii) (relating to events causing dissociation), if a partner transfers a transferable interest, the transferor retains the rights of a partner other than the transferable interest transferred and retains all the duties and obligations of a partner.

(a) General rule.-- On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor's transferable interest and requires the partnership to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that otherwise would be paid to the judgment debtor. (b) Available relief.-- To the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to a charging order in effect under subsection (a), the court may: (1) appoint a receiver of the distributions subject to the charging order, with the power to make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made; and (2) make all other orders necessary to give effect to the charging order. (c) Foreclosure.-- Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time, the court may foreclose the lien and order the sale of the transferable interest. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a partner and is subject to section 8453 (relating to transfer of transferable interest). (d) Satisfaction of judgment.-- At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), the partner or transferee whose transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subsection (a) may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order. (e) Purchase of rights.-- At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), a partnership or one or more partners whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order. (f) Exemption laws preserved.-- This chapter shall not deprive any partner or transferee of the benefit of any exemption law applicable to the transferable interest of the partner or transferee. (g) Exclusive remedy.-- This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a person seeking, in the capacity of a judgment creditor, to enforce a judgment against a partner or transferee may satisfy the judgment from the judgment debtor's transferable interest.

(a) Right to buyout.-- If a person is dissociated as a partner without the dissociation resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under section 8481 (relating to events causing dissolution), the partnership shall cause the person's interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined under subsection (b). (b) Buyout price.-- The buyout price of the interest of a person dissociated as a partner is the amount that would have been distributable to the person under section 8486(b) (relating to disposition of assets in winding up and required contributions) if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership were sold and the partnership was wound up, with the sale price equal to the greater of: (1) the liquidation value; or (2) the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the person. (c) Interest and offsets.-- Interest accrues on the buyout price from the date of dissociation to the date of payment, except that damages for wrongful dissociation under section 8462(b) (relating to power to dissociate as partner and wrongful dissociation) and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the person dissociated as a partner to the partnership must be offset against the buyout price. (d) Indemnification.-- A partnership shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless a person dissociated as a partner whose interest is being purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred by an act of the person under section 8472 (relating to power to bind and liability of person dissociated as partner). (e) Payment of partnership's estimate.-- If an agreement for the purchase of the interest of a person dissociated as a partner is not reached within 120 days after a demand in record form for payment, the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in money to the person the amount the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under subsection (c). (f) Buyout of deferred payment.-- If a deferred payment is authorized under subsection (h), the partnership may tender an offer in record form to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under subsection (c), stating the time of payment, the amount and type of security for payment and the other terms and conditions of the obligation. (g) Information accompanying payment.-- The payment or tender required by subsection (e) or (f) must be accompanied by the following: (1) a statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of dissociation; (2) the latest available partnership balance sheet and income statement, if any; (3) an explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was calculated; and (4) notice in record form that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless, within 120 days after the notice, the person dissociated as a partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under subsection (c) or other terms of the obligation to purchase. (h) Deferred payment on wrongful dissociation.-- A person that wrongfully dissociates as a partner before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any part of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the person establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment must be adequately secured and bear interest. (i) Right to bring action.-- A person dissociated as a partner may maintain an action against the partnership, under section 8448(b) (relating to actions by partnership and partners), to determine the buyout price of that person's interest, any offsets under subsection (c) or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action must be commenced within 120 days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one year after demand in record form for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the person's interest, any offset due under subsection (c), and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (h), the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership's failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subsection (g). Cross References.

      "text": "§ 8613. Manner of executing anatomical gifts. (a) Gifts by will.-- A gift of all or part of the body under section 8611(a) (relating to persons who may execute anatomical gift) may be made by will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the testator without waiting for probate. If the will is not probated or if it is declared invalid for testamentary purposes, the gift, to the extent that it has been acted upon in good faith, is nevertheless valid and effective. (b) Gifts by other documents.-- A gift of all or part of the body under section 8611(a) may also be made by document other than a will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the donor. The document, which may be a card designed to be carried on the person, must be signed by the donor in the presence of two witnesses who must sign the document in his presence. If the donor is mentally competent to signify his desire to sign the document but is physically unable to do so, the document may be signed for him by another at his direction and in his presence in the presence of two witnesses who must sign the document in his presence. Delivery of the document of gift during the donor's lifetime is not necessary to make the gift valid. (b.1) Other means.-- An anatomical gift may be made by a statement or symbol indicating that the donor has made an anatomical gift, which shall be recorded in a donor registry or on the donor's driver's license or identification card. If an anatomical gift is indicated on a driver's license or an identification card, the anatomical gift is not invalidated by revocation, suspension, expiration or cancellation of: (1) the driver's license under 75 Pa.C.S. Ch. 15 (relating to licensing of drivers); or (2) the identification card by the Department of Transportation. (c) Specified and unspecified donees.-- The gift may be made to a specified donee or without specifying a donee. If the latter, the gift may be accepted by the attending physician as donee upon or following death. If the gift is made to a specified donee who is not available at the time and place of death, the attending physician upon or following death, in the absence of any expressed indication that the donor desired otherwise, may accept the gift as donee. The physician who becomes a donee under this subsection shall not participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part. (d) Designation of person to carry out procedures.-- (Deleted by amendment). (d.1) Reliance.-- Subject to the provisions of section 8616(c) (relating to rights and duties at death), a person may rely on a document of gift or amendment to a document of gift as being valid unless that person knows that the document of gift was not validly executed or was revoked. (e) Consent not necessary.-- (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a donor's gift of all or any part of the donor's body, including a designation in a registry on a driver's license or identification card, donor card, advance health care directive, will or other document of gift, may not be revoked by the next of kin or other persons identified in section 8611(b). The consent of any person at the time of the donor's death or immediately thereafter is not necessary to render the gift valid and effective. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit the donation of a vascularized composite allograft. (2) An agent, only if expressly authorized in writing in a power of attorney, advance health care directive, health care power of attorney or other document to override the decedent's instructions on the making of an anatomical gift, may revoke the decedent's gift. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit the donation of a vascularized composite allograft. (f) Documentation of gifts by others.-- Any gift by a person designated in section 8611(b) shall be made by a document signed by him or made by his telegraphic, recorded telephonic or other recorded message. (g) Validity.-- A document of gift is valid if executed in accordance with: (1) this subchapter; (2) the law of the state or country where it was executed; or (3) the law of the state or country where, at the time of execution of the document of gift, the person making the anatomical gift: (i) is domiciled; (ii) has a place of residence; or (iii) is a citizen. (h) Choice of law.-- If a document of gift is valid under this section, the law of this Commonwealth governs interpretation of the document. (i) Rights and protections for certain individuals.-- (1) An individual who is in need of an anatomical gift shall not be deemed ineligible to receive an anatomical gift solely because of the individual's physical or mental disability, except to the extent that the physical or mental disability has been found by a physician or surgeon following an individualized evaluation of the individual to be medically significant to the provision of the anatomical gift. If an individual has the necessary support system to assist the individual in complying with posttransplant medical requirements, an individual's inability to independently comply with those requirements shall not be deemed to be medically significant. (2) As used in this subsection, \"disability\" shall have the same meaning as in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327). (Oct. 23, 2018, P.L.594, No.90) 2018 Amendment. Act 90 amended subsec. (e), added subsecs. (b.1), (d.1), (g), (h) and (i) and deleted subsec. (d).

If the gift is of a part of the body, the donee, upon the death of the donor and prior to embalming, shall cause the part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation. After removal of the part, custody of the remainder of the body vests in the surviving spouse, next of kin or other persons under obligation to dispose of the body. (b) Physicians.-- The time of death shall be determined by a physician who tends the donor at his death or, if none, the physician who certifies the death. (c) Certain liability limited.-- The following shall apply: (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a person who acts in good faith in accordance with the terms of this subchapter or with the anatomical gift laws of another state or a foreign country shall not be liable for damages in any civil action or subject to prosecution in any criminal proceeding for the person's act. (2) The immunity from civil liability provided under paragraph (1) shall not extend to acts or omissions resulting from gross negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct of the person. (3) Neither a person making an anatomical gift nor a donor's estate shall be liable for injury or damage that results from the making or use of the anatomical gift. In determining whether an anatomical gift has been made, amended or revoked under this subchapter, a person may rely upon representations of an individual listed in section 8611(b) regarding the individual's relationship to the donor or decedent unless the person knows that the representation is untrue. (d) Law on autopsies applicable.-- Subject to the provisions of section 8626 (relating to facilitation of anatomical gift from decedent whose death is under investigation), the provisions of this subchapter are subject to the laws of this Commonwealth prescribing powers and duties with respect to autopsies.

(a) Procedure.-- A hospital located in this Commonwealth shall notify the applicable designated organ procurement organization or a third party designated by the organ procurement organization of an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in the hospital. Notification shall be made in a timely manner to ensure that examination, evaluation and ascertainment of donor status as specified in subsection (d) may be completed within a time frame compatible with the donation of organs and tissues for transplant. The notification shall be made without regard to whether the person has executed an advance health care directive. (b) Referrals.-- If an organ procurement organization receives a referral of an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital, the organ procurement organization shall make a reasonable search of the records of the Donate Life PA Registry or the applicable State donor registry that the organ procurement organization knows exists for the geographic area in which the individual resided or resides in order to ascertain whether the individual has made an anatomical gift. (c) Document of gift.-- (1) If the individual whose death is imminent or has died in the hospital has a document of gift which authorizes an anatomical donation, including registration with the Donate Life PA Registry, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall attempt to notify a person listed in section 8611(b) (relating to persons who may execute anatomical gift) of the gift. (2) If no document of gift is known to the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor, then the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall ask the persons listed in section 8611(b) whether the individual had a validly executed document of gift. If there is no evidence of an anatomical gift by the individual, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall notify a person listed in section 8611(b) of the option to donate organs and tissues. The notification shall be performed in accordance with a protocol that encourages discretion and sensitivity to family circumstances in all discussions regarding donations of organs and tissues.

(a) General rule.-- A general partner owes to the limited partnership and, subject to section 8691 (relating to direct action by partner), the other partners the duties of loyalty and care stated in subsections (b) and (c). (b) Duty of loyalty.-- The fiduciary duty of loyalty of a general partner includes the duties: (1) to account to the limited partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the general partner: (i) in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's activities and affairs; (ii) from a use by the general partner of the partnership's property; or (iii) from the appropriation of a partnership opportunity; (2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's activities and affairs as or on behalf of a person having an interest adverse to the partnership; and (3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's activities and affairs. (c) Duty of care.-- The duty of care of a general partner in the conduct or winding up of the limited partnership's activities and affairs is to refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, willful or intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law. (d) Good faith and fair dealing.-- A general partner shall discharge the duties and obligations under this title or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistent with the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (e) Self-serving conduct.-- A general partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this title or under the partnership agreement solely because the general partner's conduct furthers the general partner's own interest. (f) Authorization or ratification.-- All the partners of a limited partnership may authorize or ratify, after full disclosure of all material facts, a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty of a general partner. (g) Fairness as a defense.-- It is a defense to a claim under subsection (b)(2) and any comparable claim in equity or at common law that the transaction was fair to the limited partnership at the time it is authorized or ratified under subsection (f). (h) Rights and obligations in approved transactions.-- If a general partner enters into a transaction with the limited partnership which otherwise would be prohibited by subsection (b)(2) and the transaction is authorized or ratified as provided in subsection (f) or the partnership agreement, the general partner's rights and obligations arising from the transaction are the same as those of a person that is not a general partner. (i) Exoneration.-- The partnership agreement may provide that a general partner shall not be personally liable for monetary damages to the partnership or the other partner for a breach of subsection (c), except that a general partner may not be exonerated for an act that constitutes recklessness, willful misconduct or a knowing violation of law.

The authorization may be in a will, living will, health care power of attorney, power of attorney or other document. In order to be valid, the authorization must be in writing, witnessed by two other individuals and explicitly and specifically state that the individual authorizes the recovery of the individual's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts. The authorization must be provided separately from an anatomical donation. If the individual explicitly, specifically and separately authorizes such a gift and requests reconstructive surgery, then the surgery shall be provided at no cost to the individual or the individual's family or representative. Any limitations on the provision of the gift authorized by the individual shall be honored by the hospital, a donee under section 8662 (relating to donees and vascularized composite allografts), health care professionals involved in the recovery and transplantation process, the organ procurement organizations and any other person involved with the donation and recovery of a vascularized composite allograft. If the individual authorizes a gift of hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts, then authorization of a surrogate decision maker shall not be necessary. (2) It is unlawful for a minor to authorize the donation of the minor's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts. In the case of a minor whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital, a parent or guardian may authorize donation of the minor's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts if the parent or guardian does not have actual notice of contrary indications on the part of the minor with respect to making a donation of the minor's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts and there is no actual notice of opposition by the other parent. If the parent or guardian has actual notice of contrary indications or there is actual notice of opposition by the other parent, then the parent or guardian is not authorized to make such a gift. The hospital, health care professionals, organ procurement organization and a donee under section 8662 shall not effectuate a donation if the minor evidenced contrary indications regarding donation of the minor's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts or there is actual notice of opposition by the other parent. (3) A gift of a vascularized composite allograft under this section may be revoked or amended at any time and in the manner specified in section 8615 (relating to amendment or revocation of gift).

      "text": "§ 8673. Charging order. (a) General rule.-- On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor's transferable interest and requires the limited partnership to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that otherwise would be paid to the judgment debtor. (b) Available relief.-- To the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to a charging order in effect under subsection (a), the court may: (1) appoint a receiver of the distributions subject to the charging order, with the power to make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made; and (2) make all other orders necessary to give effect to the charging order. (c) Foreclosure.-- Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time, the court may foreclose the lien and order the sale of the transferable interest. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a partner and is subject to section 8672 (relating to transfer of transferable interest). (d) Satisfaction of judgment.-- At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), the partner or transferee whose transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subsection (a) may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order. (e) Purchase of rights.-- At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), a limited partnership or one or more partners whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order.

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided in subsection (b), in any action or proceeding brought by one or more partners of a limited partnership to enforce rights that the plaintiff claims could be, but have not been, asserted by the partnership, each plaintiff has standing to commence and maintain a derivative action only if the plaintiff: (1) was a partner at the time of the transaction or conduct of which the plaintiff complains, or that the plaintiff's interest as a partner devolved upon the plaintiff by operation of law from a person who was a partner at that time; and (2) continues to be a partner until the time of judgment, unless the failure to do so is the result of partnership action that: (i) was done merely to eliminate derivative claims; or (ii) has the effect of a reorganization that does not affect the plaintiff's ownership of the business enterprise. (b) Exception.-- Any partner that, except for the provisions of subsection (a), would be entitled to maintain the action or proceeding and that does not meet such requirements may, nevertheless in the discretion of the court, be allowed to maintain the action or proceeding on preliminary showing to the court, by application and upon such verified statements and depositions as may be required by the court, that there is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on behalf of the limited partnership and that without the action serious injustice will result. (c) Security for costs.-- In any action or proceeding instituted or maintained by partners holding transferable interests entitled to receive less than 5% of any distribution by a limited partnership, unless the transferable interests held by the partners have an aggregate fair market value in excess of $200,000, the partnership in whose right the action or proceeding is brought shall be entitled at any stage of the proceedings to require the plaintiffs to give security for the reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the partnership in connection therewith or for which it may become liable pursuant to section 8648(b) (relating to reimbursement, indemnification, advancement and insurance) to which security the partnership shall have recourse in such amount as the court determines upon the termination of the action or proceeding. The amount of security may, from time to time, be increased or decreased in the discretion of the court upon showing that the security provided has or is likely to become inadequate or excessive. The security may be denied or limited by the court if the court finds after an evidentiary hearing that undue hardship on plaintiffs and serious injustice would result.

(b) Discovery stay.-- If the general partners appoint a special litigation committee and an action is commenced before a determination has been made under subsection (e): (1) On motion by the limited partnership, or the committee made in the name of the partnership, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation, except for good cause shown. (2) The time for the defendants to plead shall be tolled until the process provided for under subsection (f) has been completed. (c) Composition of committee.-- A special litigation committee shall be composed of two or more individuals who: (1) are not interested in the claims asserted in the demand or action; (2) are capable as a group of objective judgment in the circumstances; and (3) may, but need not, be general or limited partners. (c.1) Committee members who are not general partners.-- A member of a special litigation committee who is not a general partner, when acting as a member of the committee, is subject to the liabilities imposed, and entitled to the rights and immunities conferred, by sections 8648 (relating to reimbursement, indemnification, advancement and insurance) and 8649 (relating to standards of conduct for general partners). (d) Appointment of committee.-- A special litigation committee may be appointed: (1) by a majority of the general partners not named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action; or (2) if all general partners are named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action, by a majority of the general partners so named. (e) Determination.-- After appropriate investigation by a special litigation committee, the committee may determine, or the committee may recommend to the general partners that the general partners determine, that it is in the best interests of the limited partnership that: (1) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand not be brought by the partnership but that the partnership not object to an action being brought by the party that made the demand; (2) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be brought by the partnership; (3) some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; (4) an action not be brought based on any of the claims asserted in the demand; (5) an action already commenced continue under the control of: (i) the plaintiff; (ii) the limited partnership; or (iii) the committee; (6) some or all of the claims asserted in an action already commenced be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; or (7) an action already commenced be dismissed. (f) Court review and action.-- If a special litigation committee is appointed and a derivative action is commenced before or after either the committee makes a determination under subsection (e) or the general partners determine under that subsection to accept the recommendation of the committee: (1) The limited partnership or the committee shall file with the court after a determination is made under subsection (e) a statement of the determination and a report of the committee supporting the determination. The partnership or the committee shall serve each party with a copy of the determination and report. If the partnership or the committee moves to file the report under seal, the report shall be served on the parties subject to an appropriate stipulation agreed to by the parties or a protective order issued by the court. (2) The partnership or the committee shall file with the court a motion, pleading or notice consistent with the determination under subsection (e). (3) If the determination is one described in subsection (e)(2), (3), (4), (5)(ii), (6) or (7), the court shall determine whether the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its determination or recommendation in good faith, independently and with reasonable care. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the committee did not meet those qualifications or act in the required manner. If the court finds that the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and that the committee acted in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee or the general partners. Otherwise, the court shall: (i) dissolve any stay of discovery entered under subsection (b); (ii) allow the action to continue under the control of the plaintiff; and (iii) permit the defendants to file preliminary objections and other appropriate motions and pleadings. (g) Attorney General.-- Nothing in this section shall limit the rights, powers and duties of the Attorney General under other applicable law with respect to a limited partnership organized for a charitable purpose. (h) Interest of a defendant.-- The fact that a person is named as a defendant does not make the person interested in the claims asserted in a demand or action for purposes of subsection (c)(1) if the claims against the person: (1) are based only on an allegation that the person approved of or acquiesced in the transaction or conduct that is the subject of the claims; and (2) do not otherwise allege with particularity facts that, if true, raise a significant prospect that the person would be adjudged liable.

      "text": "§ 8703. Adoption of referendum. (a) General rule.-- (1) In order to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter, a governing body shall use the procedures set forth in subsection (b). (2) Any governing body after making an election to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter may, after a period of at least three full fiscal years, elect under the provisions of subsection (c) to levy, assess and collect the taxes prohibited by section 8701(b) (relating to general tax authorization) to the extent otherwise provided by law. If the electorate approves such referendum, the governing body shall lose the authority to continue to levy an earned income and net profits tax authorized under this chapter. (b) Public referendum requirements.-- Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements of section 8716 (relating to procedure and administration), a governing body may levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter only by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at only the municipal election preceding the fiscal year when the earned income and net profits tax will be initially imposed. The referendum question must state the initial rate of the proposed earned income and net profits tax, the reason for the tax and the amount of proposed budgeted revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum, expressed as a percent increase over the prior year's budgeted revenue. Any increase in budgeted revenue between the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum and the prior year's budgeted revenue shall not exceed the annual percent change in the Statewide average weekly wage. The question shall be in clear language that is readily understandable by a layperson. For the purpose of illustration, a referendum question may be framed as follows: Do you favor the imposition of an earned income and net profits tax of X% to be used to replace (names of local taxes to be repealed), reduce real property taxes by X% by means of a homestead exclusion and provide for a one-time revenue increase of X% over the preceding fiscal year? A nonlegal interpretative statement must accompany the question in accordance with section 201.1 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code, that includes the following: the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax and the maximum allowable rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the estimated revenues to be derived from the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the amount of proposed revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum; the estimated reduction in real property taxes and the elimination of certain existing taxes under this chapter; the identification of the existing taxes to be eliminated under this chapter; the method to be used to reduce real property taxes; the class or classes of real property for which real property taxes would be reduced; and the estimated amount of real property tax reduction by class, expressed as an average percent reduction by class. Any governing body which uses the procedures under this section shall not be subject to the provisions of section 8704 (relating to public referendum requirements for increasing property taxes previously reduced) for any future increases in the earned income and net profits tax rates authorized under this chapter. Any future real property tax rate increases are subject to the provisions of section 8704. If the ballot question fails to receive a majority vote pursuant to this section, approval of the electorate under section 8704 shall not be required to increase the rate of any tax which the governing body of the affected school district is authorized to levy and increase pursuant to any other act. (c) Public referendum requirements to end participation under this chapter.-- Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements in section 4 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, a governing body may elect to end participation under this chapter in accordance with subsection (a)(2) by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at a municipal election. (d) Public requirements to initiate referendum.-- (1) If the governing body of a school district fails to place a referendum question on the ballot within two years after the effective date of this chapter, the electors of the school district may: (i) Circulate a petition which, if signed by electors comprising 2% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with the election officials and submitted to the governing body thereof, shall require the governing body to establish a local tax study commission. The provisions under paragraph (2)(v), (vi), (vii), (viii) (ix) and (x) shall not apply to this subparagraph. (ii) If the local tax study commission makes a recommendation to levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter and the governing body fails to place the recommendation or other alternative of the governing body authorized under this chapter on the ballot in accordance with this chapter at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the submission of the recommendation to the governing body, a petition under this paragraph may be circulated. If the petition is signed by the electors comprising 5% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with election officials at least 90 days prior to the next municipal election, the petition shall compel the election officials to place the recommendation upon the ballot at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the filing of the petition. (2) The following requirements shall apply to the process under paragraph (1): (i) The name and street address of each elector signing the petition and of the person filing the petition shall be clearly stated on the petition. The petition shall include an affidavit of the circulator that he or she is a qualified elector of the school district referred to in the petition; that the signers signed with full knowledge of the contents of the petition; that the signers' residences are correctly stated; and that, to the best of the circulator's knowledge and belief, the signers are qualified electors. (ii) The election officials shall, within ten days after filing, review the petition as to the number and qualifications of signers. If the petition appears to be defective, the election officials shall immediately notify the person filing the petition of the defect and may reject the petition if warranted. (iii) The petition as submitted to the election officials, along with the list of signatories, shall be open to public inspection in the office of the election officials. (iv) If the election officials find that the petition as submitted is in proper order, they shall send copies of the petition without signatures thereon to the governing body involved. (v) The procedure for the referendum shall be governed by the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code. (vi) If the election officials find the petition meets the requirements of this chapter, they shall place the proposal on the ballot in a manner fairly representing the content of the petition for decision by referendum at the proper election. (vii) The election officials shall certify the date for the referendum and shall notify the governing body at least 30 days prior to such date. (viii) At least 30 days' notice of the referendum shall be given by proclamation of the governing body. A copy of the proclamation shall be posted at each polling place on the day of the election and shall be published once in at least one newspaper of general circulation which is distributed within the school district during the 30-day period prior to the election. (ix) Approval of a referendum shall be by majority vote of those voting in the school district involved. (x) The election officials shall certify the results of the referendum to the governing body. (e) School districts located in more than one county.-- (1) In the event a school district is located in more than one county, petitions under this section shall be filed with the election officials of the county wherein the administrative offices of the school district are located. (2) The election officials receiving a petition shall be responsible for all administrative functions in reviewing and certifying the validity of the petition and for making all necessary communications with the school district. (3) If the election officials of the county receiving the petition certify that it is sufficient under this subpart and determine that a question should be placed upon the ballot, such decision shall be communicated to election officials in any other county in which the school district is also located. Election officials in the other county or counties shall cooperate with election officials of the county receiving the petition to insure that an identical question is placed on the ballot at the same election throughout the entire school district. (4) Election officials from each county involved shall independently certify the results from their county to the governing body. Cross References.

      "text": "§ 8854. Appeals to court. (a) Court of common pleas.-- (1) Following an appeal to the board, any appellant, property owner or affected taxing district may appeal the board's decision to the court of common pleas in the county in which the property is located in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. § 5571(b) (relating to appeals generally) and local rules of court. (2) In any appeal of an assessment the court shall make the following determinations: (i) The market value as of the date the appeal was filed before the board. In the event subsequent years have been made a part of the appeal, the court shall determine the market value for each year. (ii) The common level ratio which was applicable in the original appeal to the board. In the event subsequent years have been made a part of the appeal, the court shall determine the applicable common level ratio for each year published by the State Tax Equalization Board on or before July 1 of the year prior to the tax year being appealed. (3) The court, after determining the market value of the property pursuant to paragraph (2)(i), shall then apply the established predetermined ratio to that value unless the corresponding common level ratio determined pursuant to paragraph (2)(ii) varies by more than 15% from the established predetermined ratio, in which case the court shall apply the applicable common level ratio to the corresponding market value of the property. (4) If a county has effected a countywide revision of assessments which was used to develop the common level ratio last determined by the State Tax Equalization Board, the following shall apply: (i) If a county changes its assessment base by applying a change in predetermined ratio, the court shall apply the percentage change between the existing predetermined ratio and the newly established predetermined ratio to the county's common level ratio to establish the certified revised common level ratio for the year in which the assessment was revised. (ii) If the county performs a countywide revision of assessments by revaluing the properties and applying an established predetermined ratio, the court shall utilize the established predetermined ratio instead of the common level ratio for the year in which the assessment was revised and until the common level ratio determined by the State Tax Equalization Board reflects the revaluing of properties resulting from the revision of assessments. (5) If a taxpayer or taxing district has filed an appeal from an assessment, so long as the appeal is pending before the board or before a court on appeal from the determination of the board, as provided by statute, the appeal will also be taken as an appeal by the appellant on the subject property for any valuation for any assessment subsequent to the filing of an appeal with the board and prior to the determination of the appeal by the board or the court. This provision shall be applicable to all pending appeals as well as future appeals. (6) In any appeal by a taxable person from an action by the board, the board shall have the power and duty to present a prima facie case in support of its assessment, to cross-examine witnesses, to discredit or impeach any evidence presented by the taxable person, to prosecute or defend an appeal in any appellate court and to take any other necessary steps to defend its valuation and assessment. (7) Appeals to a court of common pleas may be referred by the court to a board of arbitrators under 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 73 Subch. C (relating to judicial arbitration) or to a board of viewers under 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 21 Subch. E (relating to boards of viewers) in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. (8) The cost of the appeal shall be apportioned or fixed as the court may direct. (9) Nothing in this subsection shall: (i) Prevent an appellant from appealing a base-year valuation without reference to ratio. (ii) Be construed to abridge, alter or limit the right of an appellant to assert a challenge under section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. (b) Appeals to Commonwealth Court or Supreme Court.-- The board, or any party to the appeal to the court of common pleas, may appeal from the judgment, order or decree of the court of common pleas. (c) Payment of taxes pending appeal.-- An appeal shall not prevent the collection of taxes based on the assessment appealed. If the assessment is reduced, then any overpayment of taxes together with interest at a rate pursuant to section 8843 (relating to spot reassessment) from the date of overpayment shall be returned to the person or persons who paid the taxes. The appellant may protest the taxes due. The protest must be in writing addressed to the tax collector. It shall be the duty of the tax collector to notify the taxing districts of any payment under protest by delivering to them a copy of the protest. The taxing districts shall be required to segregate 25% of the amount of the tax paid in a separate account and shall not be permitted to expend any portion of any segregated amount unless it first petitions the court, alleging that the segregated amount is unjustly withheld. The court shall have power to order the taxing district to use a portion of any segregated amount as the court deems reasonably free from dispute, and the remainder of the segregated amount shall be held segregated by the taxing district, pending the final disposition of the appeal. Upon final disposition of the appeal, the amount of the overpayment found to be due the appellant as a refund shall also be a legal setoff or credit against any future taxes assessed against the appellant by the same taxing district. If a taxing district alleges that it is unable to credit all of the refund due in one year, the court, upon application of either party, shall determine over what period of time the refund due shall be made and in what manner.

In addition to any charge otherwise permitted by law, a municipality, a third-party agency or the Department of Labor and Industry may charge an additional fee of $10 to each person to whom a permit is issued for administrative costs incurred in compliance with this section. The assessment office may provide for the electronic submission of a permit through electronic mail or any other means of electronic transmission or uploading of the permit in its existing form. The provision of permits or permit information to the assessment office as required by this section shall not be subject to the procedures of the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law. No agency, public official or public employee shall be liable for civil or criminal damages or penalties for complying with this section.

Upon receipt of the notice, the municipality, third-party agency or Department of Labor and Industry shall investigate and consult with the assessment office and take any steps the municipality, third-party agency or Department of Labor and Industry deems necessary to remediate the noncompliance. (2) If, after consultation, noncompliance with subsection (a) continues, the assessment office may, in the case of continuing noncompliance after notice by a municipality or third-party agency, institute an action in mandamus before the court of common pleas to compel compliance with subsection (a). Should the court determine that the noncompliance is intentional, the court shall award any costs, disbursements, reasonable attorney fees and witness fees relating to the action to the assessment office. (b) Substantial improvement.-- If a person makes improvements to any real property, other than painting of or normal regular repairs to a building, aggregating more than $4,000 in value and a building permit is not required for the improvements, the property owner shall furnish the following information to the board: (1) the name and address of the person owning the property; (2) a description of the improvements made or to be made to the property; and (3) the dollar value of the improvements. (b.1) County improvement certification form.-- The county commissioners may, by ordinance, require that all persons making substantial improvements to property as set forth in subsection (b) submit to the county assessment office a county improvement certification form setting forth the information in subsection (b) prior to beginning any substantial improvement, regardless of whether a building permit is required. The county may provide for the electronic submission of the form and a fee no greater than $5. The county may cooperate with a municipality, third-party agency or the Department of Labor and Industry in the distribution of forms. (c) Civil penalty.-- (1) The board may assess a civil penalty of not more than $100 upon a person for intentionally failing to comply with the provisions of subsection (b) or an ordinance enacted in accordance with subsection (b.1) or intentionally falsifying the information required. (2) If a civil penalty is assessed against a person under paragraph (1), the board must notify the person by certified mail of the nature of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty and that the person may notify the board in writing within 10 calendar days that the person wishes to contest the civil penalty. If, within 10 calendar days from the receipt of that notification, the person does not notify the county board of assessment of the person's intent to contest the assessed penalty, the civil penalty shall become final. (3) If timely notification of the intent to contest the civil penalty is given, the person contesting the civil penalty shall be provided with a hearing in accordance with 2 Pa.C.S. Chs. 5 Subch. B (relating to practice and procedure of local agencies) and 7 Subch. B (relating to judicial review of local agency action). (d) Existing provisions preserved.-- Nothing in this section shall supersede or preempt any ordinance, resolution or other requirement of a county to submit information on substantial improvements in effect on the effective date of this subsection. (e) Substantial improvement value.-- Beginning January 1 of the year immediately following the effective date of this subsection and each January 1 thereafter, the amount set forth in subsection (b) shall be increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland area, for the most recent 12-month period that figures have been officially reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics immediately prior to the date the adjustment is due to take effect.

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided in subsection (b), in any action or proceeding brought by one or more members or managers of a limited liability company to enforce rights that the plaintiff claims could be, but have not been, asserted by the company, each plaintiff has standing to commence and maintain the derivative action if the plaintiff: (1) was a member or manager of the company at the time of the transaction or conduct of which the plaintiff complains, or that the plaintiff's status as a member or manager devolved upon the plaintiff by operation of law from a person who was a member or manager at that time; and (2) continues to be a member or manager until the time of judgment, unless the failure to do so is the result of company action that: (i) was done merely to eliminate derivative claims; or (ii) has the effect of a reorganization that does not affect the plaintiff's ownership of the business enterprise. (b) Exception.-- Any member or manager that, except for the provisions of subsection (a), would be entitled to maintain the action or proceeding and who does not meet such requirements may, nevertheless in the discretion of the court, be allowed to maintain the action or proceeding on preliminary showing to the court, by application and upon such verified statements and depositions as may be required by the court, that there is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on behalf of the company and that without the action serious injustice will result. (c) Security for costs.-- In any action or proceeding instituted or maintained by members holding transferable interests entitled to receive less than 5% of any distribution by a limited liability company, unless the transferable interests held by the members have an aggregate fair market value in excess of $200,000, the company in whose right the action or proceeding is brought shall be entitled at any stage of the proceedings to require the plaintiffs to give security for the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, that may be incurred by the company in connection therewith or for which it may become liable pursuant to section 8848(b) (relating to reimbursement, indemnification, advancement and insurance) to which security the company shall have recourse in such amount as the court determines upon the termination of the action or proceeding. The amount of security may, from time to time, be increased or decreased in the discretion of the court upon showing that the security provided has or may become inadequate or excessive. The security may be denied or limited by the court if the court finds after an evidentiary hearing that undue hardship on plaintiffs and serious injustice would result. (d) Failure to maintain ownership.-- If a plaintiff loses the right to maintain a derivative action under subsection (a)(2), the court may entertain a motion by the limited liability company to substitute the limited liability company as the named plaintiff.

(a) General rule.-- If a limited liability company or its members or managers receive a demand to bring an action to enforce a right of the company, or if a derivative action is commenced before demand has been made on the company or its members or managers, the members in a member-managed limited liability company, or the managers in a manager-managed limited liability company, may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the demand or action and to determine on behalf of the company or recommend to the managers or members whether pursuing any of the claims asserted is in the best interests of the company. The company must deliver a notice in record form to the person making the demand, or to the plaintiff if a derivative action has been commenced, promptly after the appointment of a committee under this section notifying the person making the demand or the plaintiff that a committee has been appointed and identifying by name the members of the committee. A committee may not be appointed under this section if: (1) every member of the company is also a manager of the company; or (2) the company is member-managed and every member is actively involved in the management of the company. (b) Discovery stay.-- If the members or managers appoint a special litigation committee and an action is commenced before a determination has been made under subsection (e): (1) On motion by the limited liability company, or the committee made in the name of the company, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation, except for good cause shown. (2) The time for the defendants to plead shall be tolled until the process provided for under subsection (f) has been completed. (c) Composition of committee.-- A special litigation committee shall be composed of two or more individuals who: (1) are not interested in the claims asserted in the demand; (2) are capable as a group of objective judgment in the circumstances; and (3) may, but need not, be members or managers. (c.1) Committee members who are not managers.-- A member of a special litigation committee who is not a manager, when acting as a member of the committee, is subject to the liabilities imposed, and entitled to the rights and immunities conferred, by sections 8848 (relating to reimbursement, indemnification, advancement and insurance) and 8849.2 (relating to standards of conduct for managers). (d) Appointment of committee.-- A special litigation committee may be appointed: (1) in a member-managed limited liability company: (i) by a majority of the members not named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action; and (ii) if all members are named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action, by a majority of the members so named; or (2) in a manager-managed limited liability company: (i) by a majority of the managers not named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action; and (ii) if all managers are named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action, by a majority of the managers so named. (e) Determination.-- After appropriate investigation by a special litigation committee, the committee may determine, or the committee may recommend to the managers or members that they determine, that it is in the best interests of the limited liability company that: (1) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand not be brought by the company but that the company not object to an action being brought by the party that made the demand: (2) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be brought by the company; (3) some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; (4) an action not be brought based on any of the claims asserted in the demand; (5) an action already commenced continue under the control of: (i) the plaintiff; (ii) the company; or (iii) the committee; (6) some or all of the claims asserted in an action already commenced be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; or (7) an action already commenced be dismissed. (f) Court review and action.-- If a special litigation committee is appointed and a derivative action is commenced either before or after either the committee makes a determination under subsection (e) or the members or managers determine under that subsection to accept the recommendation of the committee: (1) The limited liability company or the committee shall file with the court after a determination is made under subsection (e) a statement of the determination and a report of the committee supporting the determination. The company or the committee shall serve each party with a copy of the determination and report. If the company or the committee moves to file the report under seal, the report shall be served on the parties subject to an appropriate stipulation agreed to by the parties or a protective order issued by the court. (2) The company or the committee shall file with the court a motion, pleading or notice consistent with the determination under subsection (e). (3) If the determination is one described in subsection (e)(2), (3), (4), (5)(ii), (6) or (7), the court shall determine whether the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its determination or recommendation in good faith, independently and with reasonable care. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the committee did not meet those qualifications or act in the required manner. If the court finds that the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and that the committee acted in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee or the members or managers. Otherwise, the court shall: (i) dissolve any stay of discovery entered under subsection (b); (ii) allow the action to continue under the control of the plaintiff; and (iii) permit the defendants to file preliminary objections and other appropriate motions and pleadings. (g) Attorney General.-- Nothing in this section shall limit the rights, powers and duties of the Attorney General under other applicable law with respect to a limited liability company organized for a charitable purpose. (h) Interest of a defendant.-- The fact that a person is named as a defendant does not make the person interested in the claims asserted in a demand or action for purposes of subsection (c)(1) if the claims against the person: (1) are based only on an allegation that the person approved of or acquiesced in the transaction or conduct that is the subject of the claims; and (2) do not otherwise allege with particularity facts that, if true, raise a significant prospect that the person would be adjudged liable.

(a) General rule.-- Every domestic restricted professional company in existence on December 31 of any year and every qualified foreign restricted professional company that is registered to do business in this Commonwealth on December 31 of any year shall file in the Department of State with respect to that year, and on or before April 15 of the following year, a certificate of annual registration on a form provided by the department, executed by the company and accompanied by the annual registration fee prescribed by subsection (b). The department shall not charge a fee other than the annual registration fee for filing the certificate of annual registration. The certificate of annual registration shall include a statement by the company as to whether or not it engaged in any business not permitted by section 8996(a) (relating to purposes of restricted professional companies) during the year with respect to which the certificate is being filed. (b) Annual registration fee.-- (1) The annual registration fee to be paid when filing a certificate of annual registration shall be equal to a base fee of $300 times the number of persons who: (i) were members of the company on December 31 of the year with respect to which the certificate of annual registration is being filed; (ii) were licensed persons; and (iii) had their principal residence at the time in this Commonwealth. (2) The base fee of $300 shall be increased on December 31, 1997, and December 31 of every third year thereafter by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Workers during the most recent three calendar years for which that index is available on the date of adjustment. Each adjustment under this paragraph shall be rounded up to the nearest $10. (c) Notice of annual registration.-- Not later than February 1 of each year, the department shall give notice to every restricted professional company required to file a certificate of annual registration with respect to the preceding year of the requirement to file the certificate. The notice shall state the amount of the base fee payable under subsection (b)(1), as adjusted pursuant to subsection (b)(2), if applicable, and shall be accompanied by the form of certificate to be filed. Failure by the department to give notice to any party or failure by any party to receive notice of the annual registration requirement shall not relieve the party of the obligation to file the certificate. (d) Credit to Corporation Bureau Restricted Account.-- The annual registration fee shall not be deemed to be an amount received by the department under Subchapter C of Chapter 1 (relating to Corporation Bureau and UCC fees) for purposes of section 155 (relating to disposition of funds), except that $25 of the fee shall be credited to the Corporation Bureau Restricted Account. (e) Functions of Department of State.-- The department shall send to the Department of Revenue a copy of any certificate that discloses the conduct of any business not permitted by section 8996(a). (f) Annual fee to be lien.-- (1) Failure to file the certificate of annual registration required by this section shall not affect the existence or status of the restricted professional company as such, but the annual registration fee that would have been payable shall be a lien in the manner provided in this subsection from the time the annual registration fee is due and payable. If a certificate of annual registration is not filed within 30 days after the date on which it is due, the department shall assess a penalty of $500 against the company, which shall also be a lien in the manner provided in this subsection. The imposition of that penalty shall not be construed to relieve the company from liability for any other penalty or interest provided for under other applicable law. (2) If the annual registration fee paid by a restricted professional company is subsequently determined to be less than should have been paid because it was based on an incorrect number of members or was otherwise incorrectly computed, that fact shall not affect the existence or status of the restricted professional company as such, but the amount of the additional annual registration fee that should have been paid shall be a lien in the manner provided in this subsection from the time the incorrect payment is discovered by the department. (3) The annual registration fee shall bear simple interest from the date that it becomes due and payable until paid. The interest rate shall be that provided for in section 806 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code, with respect to unpaid taxes. The penalty provided for in paragraph (1) shall not bear interest. The payment of interest shall not relieve the restricted professional company from liability for any other penalty or interest provided for under other applicable law. (4) The lien created by this subsection shall attach to all of the property and proceeds thereof of the restricted professional company in which a security interest can be perfected, in whole or in part, by filing in the department under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9 (relating to secured transactions; sales of accounts, contract rights and chattel paper), whether the property and proceeds are owned by the company at the time the annual registration fee or any penalty or interest becomes due and payable or whether the property and proceeds are acquired thereafter. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the lien created by this subsection shall have priority over all other liens, security interests or other charges, except liens for taxes or other charges due the Commonwealth. The lien created by this subsection shall be entered on the records of the department and indexed in the same manner as a financing statement filed under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9. At the time an annual registration fee, penalty or interest that has resulted in the creation of a lien under this subsection is paid, the department shall terminate the lien with respect to that annual registration fee, penalty or interest without requiring a separate filing by the company for that purpose. (5) If the annual registration fee paid by a restricted professional company is subsequently determined to be more than should have been paid for any reason, no refund of the additional fee shall be made.

(2) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are less than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, each maintenance district's share shall be reduced, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocation within the funding limits, in the same proportion that each county's base allocations bears to the combined total of all counties' base allocations. (3) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are greater than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, the funds shall be distributed based upon the formula in subsection (b), but notwithstanding the formula calculation for any particular county, no county shall receive less than its base allocation in any year. (b) Formula for distribution.-- The department shall distribute to each county maintenance district: (1) an amount equal to the county's base allocation; plus (2) an amount based on the following incremental formula in which each county shall receive a portion of State highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations in excess of the total of all counties' base allocations, expressed in the following manner: ASHMA (40% RPQc + 15% BMDc + 30% LMc + 15% VMc).

The submission of data relative to BMD shall only include the immediately preceding 12-month period beginning with fiscal year 1997-1998. In each subsequent fiscal year, an additional year of data relative to BMD shall be added until such time as data from a five-year period has been accumulated. (d) Effect of insufficient funds.-- In the event sufficient funds are not available to fully fund all county maintenance districts under the formula in subsection (b) due to the hold harmless provision in subsection (a), each county maintenance district receiving an increase above its base allocation shall have its share reduced in the proportion that the increase over its base allocation bears to the total increases over the base allocation of all counties entitled to an increase, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocations within the funding limit.

(b) Notice to interest holders.-- If the ratification of the defective entity action requires action by the interest holders under section 223(c), and if the action is to be taken at a meeting, the entity must give notice to each holder of interests, regardless of whether entitled to vote, as of the record date for notice of the meeting and as of the date of the occurrence of the defective entity action. If the ratification relates to an overissue, the entity must give notice to the holders of both valid and putative interests. The entity is not required to give notice as otherwise required by this subsection to holders of valid or putative interests whose identities or addresses for notice cannot be determined from the records of the entity. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider ratification of a defective entity action and must be accompanied by: (1) either a copy of the action taken by the governors in accordance with section 223 or the information required by section 223(a)(1), (2), (3) and (4); and (2) a statement that any claim that the ratification of the defective entity action and any putative interests issued as a result of the defective entity action should not be effective, or should be effective only on certain conditions, must be brought within 120 days after the applicable validation effective time.

(d) Election of governors.-- Action by interest holders ratifying the election of governors requires either: (1) that the votes cast within the voting group favoring ratification exceed the votes cast opposing ratification of the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present; or (2) in the case of directors or a class of directors of a business corporation elected by cumulative voting, that the votes cast against ratification not be sufficient to elect one or more directors to the board or to the class.

(2) In all other cases, putative interests on the record date for determining the interest holders entitled to vote on any matter submitted to interest holders under section 223(c), and without giving effect to any ratification of putative interests that becomes effective as a result of the vote, are not entitled to vote and do not count for quorum purposes in any vote to approve the ratification of a defective entity action. (f) Required amendment.-- If the approval under this section of putative interests would result in an overissue, in addition to the approval required by section 223, approval of an amendment to the organic rules of the entity to increase the number of interests of an authorized class or series or to authorize the creation of a class or series of interests so there will be no over issue is also required.

      "text": "§ 368. Allocation of liabilities in division. (a) General rule.-- Except as provided in this section, when a division becomes effective, a resulting association is responsible: (1) Individually for the liabilities the resulting association undertakes or incurs in its own name after the division. (2) Individually for the liabilities of the dividing association that are allocated to or remain the liability of that resulting association to the extent specified in the plan of division, but not for liabilities allocated in the plan to another resulting association. (3) Jointly and severally with the other resulting associations for the liabilities of the dividing association that are not allocated by the plan of division. (b) Joint and several liability.-- If the allocation of a liability in a division is determined by the court as defined in section 102 (relating to definitions) to be ineffective or voidable under 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 (relating to voidable transactions) as of the effective date of the division, all of the following apply: (1) The allocation of the liability in the plan of division is ineffective and the liability becomes the liability of all of the resulting associations, jointly and severally. (2) The validity and effectiveness of the division are not affected by the action or proceeding or the determination of the court. (c) Breach of obligation.-- If a division breaches an obligation of the dividing association, all of the resulting associations are liable, jointly and severally, for the breach, but the validity and effectiveness of the division are not affected thereby. (d) Application of voidable transactions law.-- In applying 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 to a division under subsection (b): (1) 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 applies to the dividing association as follows: (i) If it does not survive the division, it is not subject to that chapter. (ii) If it survives the division, it is subject to that chapter only in its capacity as a resulting association. (2) 12 Pa.C.S. Ch. 51 applies to each resulting association as follows: (i) The association is treated as a debtor. (ii) Each liability allocated to the association is treated as an obligation incurred by the debtor. (iii) The association is treated as not having received a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for incurring the obligation. (iv) The property allocated to the association is treated as remaining property. (3) The remedy of joint and several liability under subsection (b)(1) is deemed to be the remedy of avoidance of the transfer or obligation under 12 Pa.C.S. § 5107(a)(1) (relating to remedies of creditor). (e) Distribution tests not applicable.-- (Deleted by amendment). (f) Liens and other charges.-- Liens, security interests and other charges on the property of the dividing association are not impaired by the division, notwithstanding any otherwise enforceable allocation of liabilities of the dividing association. (g) Security agreements.-- If the dividing association is bound by a security agreement governed by 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9 (relating to secured transactions) as enacted in any jurisdiction and the security agreement provides that the security interest attaches to after-acquired collateral, each resulting association is bound by the security agreement. (h) Creditors and guarantors.-- An allocation of a liability does not: (1) Affect the rights under other law of a creditor owed payment of the liability or performance of the obligation that creates the liability, except that those rights are available only against an association responsible for the liability or obligation under this section. (2) Release or reduce the obligation of a surety or guarantor of the liability or obligation. (i) Regulatory approvals.-- The conditions in this section for freeing one or more of the resulting associations from the liabilities of the dividing association and for allocating some or all of the liabilities of the dividing association shall be conclusively deemed to have been satisfied if the plan of division has been approved by the Department of Banking and Securities, the Insurance Department or the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in a final order issued after August 21, 2001, that is not subject to further appeal. (j) Taxes.-- Any taxes, interest, penalties and public accounts of the Commonwealth claimed against the dividing association for periods prior to the effective date of the division that are settled, assessed or determined prior to or after the division shall be the liability of all of the resulting associations and, together with interest thereon, shall be a lien against the franchises and property of each resulting association. Upon the application of the dividing association, the Department of Revenue, with the concurrence of the Department of Labor and Industry, shall release one or more, but less than all, of the resulting associations from liability and liens for all taxes, interest, penalties and public accounts of the dividing association due the Commonwealth for periods prior to the effective date of the division if those departments are satisfied that the public revenues will be adequately secured.

(3) The organic law of a domestic domesticating entity continues to apply to the release, collection or discharge of any interest holder liability preserved under paragraph (1) as if the domestication had not occurred. (4) A person has whatever rights of contribution from any other person as are provided by other law or the organic rules of a domestic domesticating entity with respect to any interest holder liability preserved under paragraph (1) as if the domestication had not occurred. (f) Service of process.-- (Deleted by amendment). (g) No dissolution.-- A domestication does not require a domestic domesticating entity to liquidate, dissolve or wind up its affairs and does not constitute or cause the liquidation or dissolution of the entity. (h) Taxes.-- Any taxes, interest, penalties and public accounts of the Commonwealth claimed against the domesticating entity that are settled, assessed or determined prior to or after the domestication shall be the liability of the domesticated entity and, together with interest thereon, shall be a lien against the franchises and property of the domesticated entity.

(a) Application for continued service.-- At any time before or after service is terminated by a public utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer, the affected tenants may apply to the utility to have service continued or resumed. (b) Payment of charges by tenants.-- A public utility shall not terminate service or shall promptly resume service previously terminated if it receives from the tenants an amount equal to the bill for the affected account of the landlord ratepayer for the billing month preceding the notice to the tenants. Thereafter, the utility shall notify each tenant of the total amount of the bill for the second and each succeeding billing month and, if the tenants fail to make payment of any bill within 30 days of the delivery of the notice to the tenants, the utility may commence termination of service, except that no termination may occur until 30 days after each tenant has been furnished notice of the proposed termination as prescribed in section 1528 (relating to delivery and contents of subsequent termination notice to tenants). The tenant or tenants shall make payment to the utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer by check or money order drawn by the tenant to the order of the utility or by cash.

(c) Disposition of payment by utility.-- Upon receiving any payment, the utility shall notify the landlord ratepayer who is liable for the utility service of the amount or amounts paid by any tenant and the amount or amounts credited to the landlord's bill for each tenant pursuant to this section. Tenants requesting continued utility service under this section, except those individually subscribing for service under subsection (d), shall not be considered utility customers but shall be considered to be acting on behalf of the landlord ratepayer, who shall remain liable to the utility for service provided after notice to tenants. In the event that the tenants fail to satisfy the requirements of subsection (b) with regard to the first billing month period preceding notice to the tenant, the utility shall refund any moneys received from a tenant to that tenant. Any payments made by the tenants shall be applied first against the bill for the billing month preceding notice to the tenants and then against bills for service rendered subsequent to the bill. Upon termination of service to the tenants for failure to pay the utility bill for service in full for any subsequent month or upon voluntary discontinuance of service at the request of the tenants, the utility shall immediately refund to the tenants any amounts paid to the utility for the billing period for which payment in full was not remitted. (d) Agreement for individual service.-- Any tenant of a residential building or mobile home park who has been notified of a proposed discontinuance of utility service pursuant to section 1523 (relating to notices before service to landlord discontinued) shall have the right to agree to subscribe for future service individually if this can be accomplished without a major revision of distribution facilities or additional right-of-way acquisitions.

(3) Where two or more proxies of a shareholder are present, the corporation shall, unless otherwise expressly provided in the proxy, accept as the vote or other action of all shares represented thereby the vote cast or other action taken by a majority of them and, if a majority of the proxies cannot agree whether the shares represented shall be voted or upon the manner of voting the shares or taking the other action, the voting of the shares or right to take other action shall be divided equally among those persons. (b) Execution and filing.-- Every proxy shall be executed or authenticated by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact and filed with or transmitted to the secretary of the corporation or its designated agent. A shareholder or his duly authorized attorney-in-fact may execute or authenticate a writing or transmit an electronic message authorizing another person to act for him by proxy. A telegram, telex, cablegram, datagram, e-mail, Internet communication or other means of electronic transmission from a shareholder or attorney-in-fact, or a photographic, facsimile or similar reproduction of a writing executed by a shareholder or attorney-in-fact: (1) may be treated as properly executed or authenticated for purposes of this subsection; and (2) shall be so treated if it sets forth or utilizes a confidential and unique identification number or other mark furnished by the corporation to the shareholder for the purposes of a particular meeting or transaction. (c) Revocation.-- A proxy, unless coupled with an interest, shall be revocable at will, notwithstanding any other agreement or any provision in the proxy to the contrary, but the revocation of a proxy shall not be effective until notice thereof has been given to the secretary of the corporation or its designated agent in writing or by electronic transmission. An unrevoked proxy shall not be valid after three years from the date of its signature, authentication or transmission unless a longer time is expressly provided therein. A proxy shall not be revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted or the authority is exercised, notice in record form of the death or incapacity is given to the secretary of the corporation or its designated agent. (d) Proxy coupled with an interest.-- As used in this section, the term \"proxy coupled with an interest\" includes: (1) a vote pooling or similar arrangement among shareholders; (2) an agreement permitted by section 1768(b) (relating to other agreements); and (3) an unrevoked proxy in favor of an existing or potential creditor of a shareholder. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the share itself or an interest in the corporation generally. (e) Cross references.-- See sections 1702 (relating to manner of giving notice) and 3135 (relating to proxies of members of mutual insurance companies).

(a) Limitation on successor asbestos-related liabilities.-- (1) Except as further limited in paragraph (2), the cumulative successor asbestos-related liabilities of a domestic business corporation that was incorporated in this Commonwealth prior to May 1, 2001, shall be limited to the fair market value of the total assets of the transferor determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation, and such corporation shall have no responsibility for successor asbestos-related liabilities in excess of such limitation. (2) If the transferor had assumed or incurred successor asbestos-related liabilities in connection with a prior merger or consolidation with a prior transferor, then the fair market value of the total assets of the prior transferor, determined as of the time of such earlier merger or consolidation, shall be substituted for the limitation set forth in paragraph (1) for purposes of determining the limitation of liability of a domestic business corporation. (b) Limitation on total assets available to satisfy successor asbestos-related liabilities.-- (1) Except as further limited in paragraph (2), the assets of a domestic business corporation that was incorporated in this Commonwealth prior to May 1, 2001, shall be exempt from restraint, attachment or execution on judgments related to claims for successor asbestos-related liabilities if the cumulative amounts which, after the time of the merger or consolidation as to which the fair market value of total assets is determined for purposes of this subsection and subsection (a), are paid or committed to be paid by or on behalf of the corporation, or by or on behalf of a transferor, in connection with settlements, judgments or other discharges of claims of asbestos-related liabilities exceed the fair market value of the total assets of the transferor, determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation. (2) If the transferor had assumed or incurred successor asbestos-related liabilities in connection with a prior merger or consolidation with a prior transferor, then the fair market value of the total assets of the prior transferor, determined as of the time of such earlier merger or consolidation, shall be substituted for the limitation set forth in paragraph (1) for purposes of determining the extent of the exemption of the assets of a domestic business corporation. (c) Fair market value of total assets.-- (1) A domestic business corporation may establish the fair market value of total assets through any method reasonable under the circumstances, including by reference to the going concern value of such assets or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for such assets in an arm's length transaction, or, in the absence of other readily available information from which fair market value can be determined, by reference to the value of such assets recorded on a balance sheet. Total assets shall include intangible assets. A showing by the domestic business corporation of a reasonable determination of the fair market value of total assets shall be prima facie evidence of their fair market value. (2) Once a reasonable determination of the fair market value of total assets has been thus established by a domestic business corporation, a claimant disputing that determination of value shall then have the burden of establishing a different fair market value of such assets. (3) For the purpose of adjusting the limitations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) to account for the passage of time, the fair market value of total assets at the time of a merger or consolidation shall be increased annually until the earlier of: (i) the date of the settlement, judgment or other discharge to which the limitations in subsection (a) or (b) are being applied; or (ii) the date on which such adjusted fair market value is first exceeded by the cumulative amounts paid or committed to be paid by or on behalf of the corporation, or by or on behalf of a transferor, after the time of the merger or consolidation as to which the fair market value of total assets is determined for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) in connection with settlements, judgments or other discharges of the successor asbestos-related liabilities; at the rate equal to the prime rate as listed in the first edition of the Wall Street Journal published for each calendar year since such merger or consolidation, plus 1%, not compounded. (d) Application.-- (1) The limitations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) shall apply to mergers or consolidations effected under the laws of this Commonwealth or another jurisdiction consummated prior to May 1, 2001. (2) The limitations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) shall apply to all asbestos claims, including existing asbestos claims, and all litigation, including existing litigation, and shall apply to successors of a domestic business corporation to which this section applies. (3) The limitations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to workers' compensation benefits paid by or on behalf of an employer to an employee pursuant to the act of June 2, 1915 (P.L.736, No.338), known as the Workers' Compensation Act, or comparable workers' compensation law of another jurisdiction. (4) The limitations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to any claim against a domestic business corporation that does not constitute a successor asbestos-related liability. (5) This section shall not apply to an insurance corporation as defined in section 3102 (relating to definitions). (6) The limitations set forth in subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to any obligations arising under the National Labor Relations Act (49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq.) or under any collective bargaining agreement. (e) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Asbestos claim.\" Any claim, wherever or whenever made, for damages, losses, indemnification, contribution or other relief arising out of, based on or in any way related to asbestos, including property damage caused by the installation, presence or removal of asbestos, the health effects of exposure to asbestos, including any claim for personal injury, death, mental or emotional injury, risk of disease or other injury or the costs of medical monitoring or surveillance. The term shall also include any claim made by or on behalf of any person exposed to asbestos or any representative, spouse, parent, child or other relative of any such person. \"Successor asbestos-related liabilities.\" Any liabilities, whether known or unknown, asserted or unasserted, absolute or contingent, accrued or unaccrued, liquidated or unliquidated or due or to become due, related in any way to asbestos claims, that were assumed or incurred by a domestic business corporation or foreign business corporation as a result of or in connection with a merger or consolidation, or the plan of merger or consolidation related thereto, with or into another domestic business corporation or foreign business corporation effected under the laws of this Commonwealth or another jurisdiction or which are related in any way to asbestos claims based on the exercise of control or the ownership of stock of such corporation prior to such merger or consolidation. The term shall also include liabilities which, after the time of the merger or consolidation as to which the fair market value of total assets is determined for purposes of subsections (a) and (b), were or are paid or otherwise discharged, or committed to be paid or otherwise discharged, by or on behalf of the corporation, or by or on behalf of a transferor, in connection with settlements, judgments or other discharges in this Commonwealth or another jurisdiction. \"Transferor.\" A domestic business corporation or foreign business corporation from which successor asbestos-related liabilities are assumed or incurred.

(b) Obligations of the corporation.-- If the controlling person or group so requests, the corporation shall, at the option of the corporation and at the expense of the person or group, either furnish a list of all such shareholders and their postal addresses to the person or group or provide the notice to all such shareholders. (c) Contents of notice.-- The notice shall state that: (1) All shareholders are entitled to demand that they be paid the fair value of their shares. (2) The minimum value the shareholder can receive under this subchapter is the highest price paid per share by the controlling person or group within the 90-day period ending on and including the date of the control transaction, and stating that value.

(a) General rule.-- If, within 45 days (or such other time period, if any, as required by applicable law) after the date of the notice required by section 2545 (relating to notice to shareholders), or, if such notice was not provided prior to the date of the written demand by the shareholder under section 2546 (relating to shareholder demand for fair value), then within 45 days (or such other time period, if any, required by applicable law) of the date of such written demand, the controlling person or group and the shareholder are unable to agree on the fair value of the shares or on a binding procedure to determine the fair value of the shares, then each shareholder who is unable to agree on both the fair value and on such a procedure with the controlling person or group and who so desires to obtain the rights and remedies provided in this subchapter shall, no later than 30 days after the expiration of the applicable 45-day or other period, surrender to the court certificates representing any of the shares that are certificated shares, duly endorsed for transfer to the controlling person or group, or cause any uncertificated shares to be transferred to the court as escrow agent under subsection (c) with a notice stating that the certificates or uncertificated shares are being surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, in connection with the petition referenced in section 2545 or, if no petition has theretofore been filed, the shareholder may file a petition within the 30-day period in the court praying that the fair value (as defined in this subchapter) of the shares be determined. (b) Effect of failure to give notice and surrender certificates.-- Any shareholder who does not so give notice and surrender any certificates or cause uncertificated shares to be transferred within such time period shall have no further right to receive, with respect to shares the certificates of which were not so surrendered or the uncertificated shares which were not so transferred under this section, payment under this subchapter from the controlling person or group with respect to the control transaction giving rise to the rights of the shareholder under this subchapter. (c) Escrow and notice.-- The court shall hold the certificates surrendered and the uncertificated shares transferred to it in escrow for, and shall promptly, following the expiration of the time period during which the certificates may be surrendered and the uncertificated shares transferred, provide a notice to the controlling person or group of the number of shares so surrendered or transferred. (d) Partial payment for shares.-- The controlling person or group shall then make a partial payment for the shares so surrendered or transferred to the court, within ten business days of receipt of the notice from the court, at a per-share price equal to the partial payment amount. The court shall then make payment as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten business days, to the shareholders who so surrender or transfer their shares to the court of the appropriate per-share amount received from the controlling person or group. (e) Appointment of appraiser.-- Upon receipt of any share certificate surrendered or uncertificated share transferred under this section, the court shall, as soon as practicable but in any event within 30 days, appoint an appraiser with experience in appraising share values of companies of like nature to the registered corporation to determine the fair value of the shares. (f) Appraisal procedure.-- The appraiser so appointed by the court shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, determine the fair value of the shares subject to its appraisal and the appropriate market rate of interest on the amount then owed by the controlling person or group to the holders of the shares. The determination of any appraiser so appointed by the court shall be final and binding on both the controlling person or group and all shareholders who so surrendered their share certificates or transferred their shares to the court, except that the determination of the appraiser shall be subject to review to the extent and within the time provided or prescribed by law in the case of other appointed judicial officers. See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5105(a)(3) (relating to right to appellate review) and 5571(b) (relating to appeals generally). (g) Supplemental payment.-- Any amount owed, together with interest, as determined pursuant to the appraisal procedures of this section shall be payable by the controlling person or group after it is so determined and upon and concurrently with the delivery or transfer to the controlling person or group by the court (which shall make delivery of the certificate or certificates surrendered or the uncertificated shares transferred to it to the controlling person or group as soon as practicable but in any event within ten business days after the final determination of the amount owed) of the certificate or certificates representing shares surrendered or the uncertificated shares transferred to the court, and the court shall then make payment, as soon as practicable but in any event within ten business days after receipt of payment from the controlling person or group, to the shareholders who so surrendered or transferred their shares to the court of the appropriate per-share amount received from the controlling person or group. (h) Voting and dividend rights during appraisal proceedings.-- Shareholders who surrender their shares to the court pursuant to this section shall retain the right to vote their shares and receive dividends or other distributions thereon until the court receives payment in full for each of the shares so surrendered or transferred of the partial payment amount (and, thereafter, the controlling person or group shall be entitled to vote such shares and receive dividends or other distributions thereon). The fair value (as determined by the appraiser) of any dividends or other distributions so received by the shareholders shall be subtracted from any amount owing to such shareholders under this section. (i) Powers of the court.-- The court may appoint such agents, including the transfer agent of the corporation, or any other institution, to hold the share certificates so surrendered and the shares surrendered or transferred under this section, to effect any necessary change in record ownership of the shares after the payment by the controlling person or group to the court of the amount specified in subsection (h), to receive and disburse dividends or other distributions, to provide notices to shareholders and to take such other actions as the court determines are appropriate to effect the purposes of this subchapter. (j) Costs and expenses.-- The costs and expenses of any appraiser or other agents appointed by the court shall be assessed against the controlling person or group. The costs and expenses of any other procedure to determine fair value shall be paid as agreed to by the parties agreeing to the procedure. (k) Jurisdiction exclusive.-- The jurisdiction of the court under this subchapter is plenary and exclusive and the controlling person or group, and all shareholders who so surrendered or transferred their shares to the court shall be made a party to the proceeding as in an action against their shares. (l) Duty of corporation.-- The corporation shall comply with requests for information, which may be submitted pursuant to procedures maintaining the confidentiality of the information, made by the court or the appraiser selected by the court. If any of the shares of the corporation are not represented by certificates, the transfer, escrow or retransfer of those shares contemplated by this section shall be registered by the corporation, which shall give the written notice required by section 1528(f) (relating to uncertificated shares) to the transferring shareholder, the court and the controlling shareholder or group, as appropriate in the circumstances. (m) Payment under optional procedure.-- Any amount agreed upon between the parties or determined pursuant to the procedure agreed upon between the parties shall be payable by the controlling person or group after it is agreed upon or determined and upon and concurrently with the delivery of any certificate or certificates representing such shares or the transfer of any uncertificated shares to the controlling person or group by the shareholder. (n) Title to shares.-- Upon full payment by the controlling person or group of the amount owed to the shareholder or to the court, as appropriate, the shareholder shall cease to have any interest in the shares.

(c) Effect of distributions.-- For purposes of this subchapter, voting shares of a corporation acquired by a holder as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or other similar distribution by a corporation of voting shares issued by the corporation and not involving a sale of such voting shares shall be deemed to have been acquired by the holder in the same transaction (at the same time, in the same manner and from the same person) in which the holder acquired the shares with respect to which such voting shares were subsequently distributed by the corporation. (d) Status of certain shares and effect of formation of group on status.-- (1) No share over which voting power, or of which beneficial ownership, was or is acquired by the acquiring person in or in connection with a control-share acquisition described in subsection (b) shall be deemed to be a control share. (2) In the case of affiliate, disinterested or existing shares, the acquisition of a beneficial ownership interest in a voting share by a group shall not, by itself, affect the status of an affiliate, disinterested or existing share, as such, if and so long as the person who had beneficial ownership of the share immediately prior to the acquisition of the beneficial ownership interest in the share by the group (or a direct or indirect transferee from the person to the extent such shares were acquired by the transferee solely pursuant to a transfer or series of transfers under subsection (b)(5)(i) through (vi)): (i) is a participant in the group; and (ii) continues to have at least the same voting and dispositive power over the share as the person had immediately prior to the acquisition of the beneficial ownership interest in the share by the group. (3) Voting shares which are beneficially owned by a person described in paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of the definition of \"affiliate shares\" in section 2562 (relating to definitions) shall continue to be deemed affiliate shares, notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection or the fact that such shares are also beneficially owned by a group. (4) No share of a corporation over which voting power, or of which beneficial ownership, was or is acquired by the acquiring person after April 27, 1990, at a time when this subchapter was or is not applicable to the corporation shall be deemed to be a control share. (5) The acquisition of record title to a voting share by a member of a group that is an acquiring person as a result of a transfer of the share from another member of the group does not constitute a control-share acquisition. (e) Application of duties.-- The duty of the board of directors, committees of the board and individual directors under section 2565 (relating to procedure for establishing voting rights of control shares) is solely to the corporation and not to any shareholder or creditor or any other person or group, and may be enforced directly by the corporation or may be enforced by an action in the right of the corporation, and may not be enforced directly by a shareholder or creditor or by any other person or group.

(a) General rule.-- The purpose of this subchapter is to protect certain registered corporations and legitimate interests of various groups related to such corporations from certain manipulative and coercive actions. Specifically, this subchapter seeks to: (1) Protect registered corporations from being exposed to and paying \"greenmail.\" (2) Promote a stable relationship among the various parties involved in registered corporations, including the public whose confidence in the future of a corporation tends to be undermined when a corporation is put \"in play.\" (3) Ensure that speculators who put registered corporations \"in play\" do not misappropriate corporate values for themselves at the expense of the corporation and groups affected by corporate actions. (4) Discourage such speculators from putting registered corporations \"in play\" through any means, including, but not limited to, offering to purchase at least 20% of the voting shares of the corporation or threatening to wage or waging a proxy contest in connection with or as a means toward or part of a plan to acquire control of the corporation, with the effect of reaping short-term speculative profits. Moreover, this subchapter recognizes the right and obligation of the Commonwealth to regulate and protect the corporations it creates from abuses resulting from the application of its own laws affecting generally corporate governance and particularly director obligations, mergers and related matters. Such laws, and the obligations imposed on directors or others thereunder, should not be the vehicles by which registered corporations are manipulated in certain instances for the purpose of obtaining short-term profits. (b) Limitations.-- The purpose of this subchapter is not to affect legitimate shareholder activity that does not involve putting a corporation \"in play\" or involve seeking to acquire control of the corporation. Specifically, the purpose of this subchapter is not to: (1) curtail proxy contests on matters properly submitted for shareholder action under applicable State or other law, including, but not limited to, certain elections of directors, corporate governance matters such as cumulative voting or staggered boards, or other corporate matters such as environmental issues or conducting business in a particular country if, in any such instance, such proxy contest is not utilized in connection with or as a means toward or part of a plan to put the corporation \"in play\" or to seek to acquire control of the corporation; or (2) affect the solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of the corporation in connection with shareholder meetings or actions of the corporation.",

Except as otherwise provided in a bylaw adopted by the members, at least one meeting of the members that are entitled to vote for the election of directors shall be held in each calendar year for the election of directors at the time provided in or fixed pursuant to authority granted by the bylaws. Failure to hold the annual or other regular meeting at the designated time shall not work a dissolution of the corporation or affect otherwise valid corporate acts. If the annual or other regular meeting is not called and held within six months after the designated time, any member may call the meeting at any time thereafter. (b) Special meetings.-- Special meetings of the members may be called at any time by: (1) the board of directors; (2) members entitled to cast at least 10% of the votes that all members are entitled to cast at the particular meeting; (3) such officers or other persons as may be provided in the bylaws; or (4) the provisions provided in section 5725(c.1) (relating to selection of directors). (b.1) Duties of secretary.-- At any time, upon written request of any person who has called a special meeting, it shall be the duty of the secretary to fix the time of the meeting which, if the meeting is called pursuant to a statutory right, shall be held within any period specified by this subpart or, if no period is specified, not more than 60 days after the receipt of the request. If the secretary neglects or refuses to fix the time of the meeting, the person or persons calling the meeting may do so. (c) Adjournments.-- Adjournments of any regular or special meeting may be taken but any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall be adjourned for no longer than from day to day, or for longer periods not exceeding 15 days each, as the members present and entitled to vote shall direct, until the directors have been elected. (d) Postponement or cancellation.-- The board of directors may postpone, or delegate to an officer the authority to postpone, the annual or other regular meeting of members, subject to the provision of subsection (a) providing for a meeting each calendar year. Unless otherwise restricted in the bylaws or otherwise provided by statute, the holding of a special meeting of members may be postponed for not more than 15 days or may be canceled by the person or group that called the special meeting.

      "text": "§ 5783. Special litigation committee. (a) General rule.-- If a nonprofit corporation or the board of directors receives a demand to bring an action to enforce a right of the corporation, or if a derivative action is commenced before demand has been made on the corporation or the board, the board may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the demand or action and to determine on behalf of the corporation or recommend to the board whether pursuing any of the claims asserted is in the best interests of the corporation. The corporation must deliver a notice in record form to the person making the demand, or to the plaintiff if a derivative action has been commenced, promptly after the appointment of a committee under this section notifying the person making the demand or the plaintiff that a committee has been appointed and identifying by name the members of the committee. (b) Discovery stay.-- If the board of directors appoints a special litigation committee and an action is commenced before a determination has been made under subsection (e): (1) On motion by the nonprofit corporation, or the committee made in the name of the corporation, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to complete its investigation, except for good cause shown. (2) The time for the defendants to plead shall be tolled until the process provided for under subsection (f) has been completed. (c) Composition of committee.-- A special litigation committee shall be composed of two or more individuals who: (1) are not interested in the claims asserted in the demand or action; (2) are capable as a group of objective judgment in the circumstances; and (3) may, but need not, be members, directors or members of an other body. (c.1) Committee members who are not directors or members of an other body.-- A member of a special litigation committee who is not a director or member of an other body, when acting as a member of the committee, is subject to the liabilities imposed, and entitled to the rights and immunities conferred by Subchapters B (relating to fiduciary duty) and D (relating to indemnification) and other provisions of law upon directors of a corporation. (d) Appointment of committee.-- A special litigation committee may be appointed: (1) by a majority of the directors not named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action; or (2) if all the directors are named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action, by a majority of: (i) the members of an other body not named as parties in the proceeding if the other body has the authority to appoint a special litigation committee; or (ii) the directors so named. (e) Determination.-- After appropriate investigation by a special litigation committee, the committee may determine, or the committee may recommend to the board of directors that the board determine that it is in the best interests of the nonprofit corporation that: (1) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand not be brought by the corporation but that the corporation not object to an action being brought by the party that made the demand; (2) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be brought by the corporation; (3) some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; (4) an action not be brought based on any of the claims asserted in the demand; (5) an action already commenced continue under the control of: (i) the plaintiff; (ii) the corporation; or (iii) the committee; (6) some or all the claims asserted in an action already commenced be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; or (7) an action already commenced be dismissed. (f) Court review and action.-- If a special litigation committee is appointed and a derivative action is commenced before or after the committee makes a determination under subsection (e) or the board of directors determines under subsection (e) to accept the recommendation of the committee: (1) The nonprofit corporation or the committee shall file with the court after a determination is made under subsection (e) a statement of the determination and a report of the committee supporting the determination. The corporation or the committee shall serve each party with a copy of the determination and report. If the corporation or the committee moves to file the report under seal, the report shall be served on the parties subject to an appropriate stipulation agreed to by the parties or a protective order issued by the court. (2) The corporation or the committee shall file with the court a motion, pleading or notice consistent with the determination under subsection (e). (3) If the determination is one described in subsection (e)(2), (3), (4), (5)(ii), (6) or (7), the court shall determine whether the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its determination or recommendation in good faith, independently and with reasonable care. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the committee did not meet those qualifications or act in the required manner. If the court finds that the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and that the committee acted in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee or the board. Otherwise, the court shall: (i) dissolve any stay of discovery entered under subsection (b); (ii) allow the action to continue under the control of the plaintiff; and (iii) permit the defendants to file preliminary objections, other appropriate pleadings and motions. (g) Attorney General.-- Nothing in this section limits the rights, powers and duties of the Attorney General under other applicable law with respect to a nonprofit corporation. (h) Interest of a defendant.-- The fact that a person is named as a defendant does not make the person interested in the claims asserted in a demand or action for purposes of subsection (c)(1) if the claims against the person: (1) are based only on an allegation that the person approved of or acquiesced in the transaction or conduct that is the subject of the claims; and (2) do not otherwise allege with particularity facts that, if true, raise a significant prospect that the person would be adjudged liable.

(5) Except as otherwise provided under this part, service as a State police officer credited in the system shall not operate to prevent any State employee from being a participant in the plan for any State service that is not service as a Class A-5 exempt employee that would otherwise result in participation in the plan. Any benefit resulting from participation in the plan shall be in addition to any benefit a State police officer may be eligible to receive as a member of the system. (6) As used in this subsection, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this paragraph unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Binding arbitration award.\" A binding arbitration award issued before July 1, 1989, under the Policemen and Firemen Collective Bargaining Act, and implemented by the board.

Article 2. Definitions.--For the purpose of this compact the following definitions shall apply: (a) A state shall mean (1) a state of the United States or any territory or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia acting under Article 1, section 10, clause 3, of the Constitution of the United States in entering this compact with an American or a foreign jurisdiction, or (2) a state of the community of nations and any component governmental unit of such a state which under the laws thereof may validly become party to this compact.

(a) Distributions.-- Each partner is entitled to share in distributions as provided in section 8445 (relating to sharing of and right to distribution before dissolution). (b) Reimbursement.-- A partnership shall reimburse a partner for: (1) Any payment made by the partner in the course of the partner's activities on behalf of the partnership, if the partner complied with this section and section 8447 (relating to standards of conduct for partners) in making the payment. (2) An advance to the partnership beyond the amount of capital the partner agreed to contribute. (c) Indemnification.-- A partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless a person with respect to any claim or demand against the person and any debt, obligation or other liability incurred by the person by reason of the person's former or present capacity as partner, if the claim, demand, debt, obligation or other liability does not arise from the person's breach of this section or section 8232 (relating to liability for improper distributions by limited liability partnership) or 8447. (d) Advances.-- In the ordinary course of its business, a partnership may advance expenses, including attorney fees and costs, incurred by a person in connection with a claim or demand against the person by reason of the person's former or present capacity as a partner, if the person promises to repay the partnership if the person ultimately is determined not to be entitled to be indemnified under subsection (c). (e) Insurance.-- A partnership may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a partner against liability asserted against or incurred by the partner in that capacity or arising from that status even if, under subsection (m), the partnership agreement could not eliminate or limit the person's liability to the partnership for the conduct giving rise to the liability. (f) Loan to partnership.-- A payment or advance made by a partner which gives rise to a partnership obligation under subsection (b) constitutes a loan to the partnership which accrues interest from the date of the payment or advance. (g) Management rights.-- Each partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the partnership's business. (h) Rights to property.-- A partner may use or possess partnership property only on behalf of the partnership. (i) Compensation for services.-- A partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for the partnership, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of the partnership. (j) Required approvals by partners.-- A difference arising as to a matter in the ordinary course of business of a partnership may be decided by a majority of the partners. An act outside the ordinary course of business of a partnership and an amendment to the partnership agreement may be undertaken only with the affirmative vote or consent of all the partners. (k) Nonexclusivity.-- The rights provided by subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking reimbursement, indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance may be entitled under the partnership agreement, vote of partners, contract or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding that position. Section 8447(f) shall be applicable to a vote, contract or other action under this subsection. A partnership may create a fund of any nature, which may, but need not be, under the control of a trustee, or otherwise secure or insure in any manner its indemnification obligations, whether arising under this section or otherwise. (l) Grounds.-- Indemnification under subsection (k) may be granted for any action taken and may be made whether or not the partnership would have the power to indemnify the person under any other provision of law except as provided in this section and whether or not the indemnified liability arises or arose from any threatened, pending or completed action by or in the right of the partnership. Indemnification under subsection (k) is declared to be consistent with the public policy of this Commonwealth. (m) Limitation.-- Indemnification under this section shall not be made in any case where the act giving rise to the claim for indemnification is determined by a court to constitute recklessness, willful misconduct or a knowing violation of law.

(c) Material information.-- The partnership shall furnish to each partner, without demand, any information concerning the partnership's business, financial condition and other circumstances which the partnership knows and is material to the proper exercise of the partner's rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this title, except to the extent the partnership can establish that it reasonably believes the member already knows the information. (d) Duty of partners.-- The duty to furnish information under subsection (c) also applies to each partner to the extent the partner knows any of the information described in subsection (c). (e) Rights after dissociation.-- Subject to subsection (j), within 10 days after receipt by a partnership of a demand made in record form, a person dissociated as a partner may have access to information to which the person was entitled while a partner if: (1) the information pertains to the period during which the person was a partner; (2) the person seeks the information in good faith; and (3) the information is material to the person's rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this title. (f) Partnership response to demand.-- Within 10 days after receiving a demand under subsection (e), the partnership shall, in record form, inform the person that made the demand of: (1) the information that the partnership will provide in response to the demand and when and where the partnership will provide the information; and (2) the partnership's reasons for declining, if the partnership declines to provide any demanded information. (g) Costs of copying.-- A partnership may charge a person that makes a demand under this section the reasonable costs of copying. (h) Exercise of rights.-- A partner or person dissociated as a partner may exercise the rights under this section through an agent or, in the case of an incapacitated person, a guardian. Any restriction or condition imposed by the partnership agreement or under subsection (j) applies both to the agent or guardian and to the partner or person dissociated as a partner. (i) No rights of transferee.-- Subject to section 8455 (relating to power of personal representative of deceased partner), the rights under this section do not extend to a person as transferee. (j) Reasonable restrictions permitted.-- In addition to any restriction or condition stated in its partnership agreement, a partnership, as a matter within the ordinary course of its business, may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on access to and use of information to be furnished under this section, including designating information confidential and imposing nondisclosure and safeguarding obligations on the recipient.

The court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether or not the person seeking inspection is entitled to the inspection sought. The court may summarily order the partnership to permit the partner or person dissociated as a partner to inspect the information and to make copies or extracts therefrom.

(a) General rule.-- A partner owes to the partnership and the other partners the duties of loyalty and care stated in subsections (b) and (c). (b) Duty of loyalty.-- The fiduciary duty of loyalty of a partner includes the duties: (1) to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the partner: (i) in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's business; (ii) from a use by the partner of the partnership's property; or (iii) from the appropriation of a partnership opportunity; (2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business as or on behalf of a person having an interest adverse to the partnership; and (3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership's business before the dissolution of the partnership. (c) Duty of care.-- The duty of care of a partner in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business is to refrain from engaging in gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or a knowing violation of law. (d) Good faith and fair dealing.-- A partner shall discharge the duties and obligations under this title or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistent with the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (e) Self-serving conduct.-- A partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this title or under the partnership agreement solely because the partner's conduct furthers the partner's own interest. (f) Authorization or ratification.-- All the partners may authorize or ratify, after disclosure of all material facts, a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty of a partner. (g) Fairness as a defense.-- It is a defense to a claim under subsection (b)(2) and any comparable claim in equity or at common law that the transaction was fair to the partnership at the time it was authorized or ratified under subsection (f). (h) Rights and obligations in approved transaction.-- If a partner enters into a transaction with the partnership which otherwise would be prohibited under subsection (b)(2), but the transaction is authorized or ratified as provided under subsection (f) or the partnership agreement, the partner's rights and obligations arising from the transaction are the same as those of a person that is not a partner. (i) Exoneration.-- The partnership agreement may provide that a partner shall not be personally liable for monetary damages to the partnership or the other partners for a breach of subsection (c), except that a partner may not be exonerated for an act that constitutes recklessness, willful misconduct or a knowing violation of law. (j) Cross reference.-- See section 8415 (relating to contents of partnership agreement). Cross References. Section 8447 is referred to in sections 8231, 8232, 8415, 8441, 8461, 8463 of this title.",

(b) Rights of transferee.-- A transferee has the right to: (1) receive, in accordance with the terms of the transfer: (i) distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled; and (ii) allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit or similar item which would otherwise be made to the transferor; and (2) seek under section 8481(a)(5) (relating to events causing dissolution) a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership business. (c) Right to account on dissolution.-- In a dissolution and winding up of a partnership, a transferee is entitled to an account of the partnership's transactions only from the date of dissolution.

(a) General rule.-- On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor's transferable interest and requires the partnership to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that otherwise would be paid to the judgment debtor. (b) Available relief.-- To the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to a charging order in effect under subsection (a), the court may: (1) appoint a receiver of the distributions subject to the charging order, with the power to make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made; and (2) make all other orders necessary to give effect to the charging order. (c) Foreclosure.-- Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time, the court may foreclose the lien and order the sale of the transferable interest. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a partner and is subject to section 8453 (relating to transfer of transferable interest). (d) Satisfaction of judgment.-- At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), the partner or transferee whose transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subsection (a) may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order. (e) Purchase of rights.-- At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), a partnership or one or more partners whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order. (f) Exemption laws preserved.-- This chapter shall not deprive any partner or transferee of the benefit of any exemption law applicable to the transferable interest of the partner or transferee. (g) Exclusive remedy.-- This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a person seeking, in the capacity of a judgment creditor, to enforce a judgment against a partner or transferee may satisfy the judgment from the judgment debtor's transferable interest.

(a) General rule.-- A dissolved partnership shall wind up its business and the partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up. (b) Conduct of winding up.-- In winding up its business, the partnership: (1) shall discharge the partnership's debts, obligations and other liabilities, settle and close the partnership's business, and marshal and distribute the assets of the partnership; and (2) may: (i) deliver to the department for filing a certificate of dissolution stating: (A) the name of the partnership; (B) if the partnership is a limited liability partnership, subject to section 109 (relating to name of commercial registered office provider in lieu of registered address), the address, including street and number, if any, of its registered office; and (C) that the partnership is dissolved; (ii) preserve the partnership business and property as a going concern for a reasonable time; (iii) prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal or administrative; (iv) transfer the partnership's property; (v) settle disputes by mediation or arbitration; (vi) deliver to the department for filing the certificates, if any, required by section 139 (relating to tax clearance of certain fundamental transactions) and a certificate of termination stating: (A) the name of the partnership; (B) if the partnership is a limited liability partnership, subject to section 109, the address, including street and number, if any, of its registered office; and (C) that the partnership is terminated; and (vii) perform other acts necessary or appropriate to the winding up. (c) Participation after dissociation.-- A person whose dissociation as a partner resulted in dissolution may participate in winding up as if still a partner, unless the dissociation was wrongful. (d) Conduct of winding up when no partner.-- If a dissolved partnership does not have a partner and no person has the right to participate in winding up under subsection (c), the personal representative or guardian of the last person to have been a partner may wind up the partnership's business. If the personal representative or guardian does not exercise that right, a person to wind up the partnership's business may be appointed by the affirmative vote or consent of transferees owning a majority of the rights to receive distributions at the time the consent is to be effective. A person appointed under this subsection has the powers of a partner under section 8484 (relating to power to bind partnership after dissolution) but is not liable for the debts, obligations and other liabilities of the partnership solely by reason of having or exercising those powers or otherwise acting to wind up the partnership's business. (e) Judicial supervision.-- On the application of any partner or person entitled under subsection (c) to participate in winding up, a court may order judicial supervision of the winding up of a dissolved partnership, including the appointment of a person to wind up the partnership's business, if: (1) the partnership does not have a partner and within a reasonable time following the dissolution no person has been appointed under subsection (d); or (2) the applicant establishes other good cause.

(a) Procedure.-- A hospital located in this Commonwealth shall notify the applicable designated organ procurement organization or a third party designated by the organ procurement organization of an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in the hospital. Notification shall be made in a timely manner to ensure that examination, evaluation and ascertainment of donor status as specified in subsection (d) may be completed within a time frame compatible with the donation of organs and tissues for transplant. The notification shall be made without regard to whether the person has executed an advance health care directive. (b) Referrals.-- If an organ procurement organization receives a referral of an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital, the organ procurement organization shall make a reasonable search of the records of the Donate Life PA Registry or the applicable State donor registry that the organ procurement organization knows exists for the geographic area in which the individual resided or resides in order to ascertain whether the individual has made an anatomical gift. (c) Document of gift.-- (1) If the individual whose death is imminent or has died in the hospital has a document of gift which authorizes an anatomical donation, including registration with the Donate Life PA Registry, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall attempt to notify a person listed in section 8611(b) (relating to persons who may execute anatomical gift) of the gift. (2) If no document of gift is known to the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor, then the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall ask the persons listed in section 8611(b) whether the individual had a validly executed document of gift. If there is no evidence of an anatomical gift by the individual, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated requestor shall notify a person listed in section 8611(b) of the option to donate organs and tissues. The notification shall be performed in accordance with a protocol that encourages discretion and sensitivity to family circumstances in all discussions regarding donations of organs and tissues. The protocol shall take into account the individual's religious beliefs or nonsuitability for organ and tissue donation. (3) The hospital administrator or the hospital administrator's designated representative shall indicate in the medical record of the individual the information under this paragraph. The information shall also be communicated by the hospital administrator or the hospital administrator's designee to the organ procurement organization or designated requestor, as appropriate: (i) whether or not a document of gift is known to exist and whether a gift was made; (ii) if a gift was made, the name of the person granting the gift and that person's relationship to the individual; and (iii) all of the following: (A) Whether the individual executed an advance health care directive, living will, power of attorney, health care power of attorney, will or other document, including a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, evidencing an intention to limit, withdraw or withhold life-sustaining measures. (B) Whether the individual indicated in an advance health care directive, living will, power of attorney, health care power of attorney, will or other document an intention to limit the anatomical gifts of the individual in any way, including the intention to limit an anatomical gift to parts of the body which do not require a ventilator or other life-sustaining measures, or to deny making or refusing to make an anatomical gift. (C) Whether the individual amended or revoked an anatomical gift in any document specified in this subparagraph or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615 (relating to amendment or revocation of gift). (d) Testing.-- (1) This subsection shall apply if: (i) a hospital refers an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital to an organ procurement organization; (ii) the organ procurement organization, in consultation with the individual's attending physician or a designee, determines, based upon a medical record review and other information supplied by the individual's attending physician or a designee, that the individual may be a prospective donor; and (iii) the individual has not: (A) indicated in an advance health care directive, a living will, power of attorney, health care power of attorney, will, DNR order or other document an intention to either limit the anatomical gifts of the individual to parts of the body which do not require a ventilator or other life-sustaining measures or indicated an intention to deny making or refusing to make an anatomical gift; or (B) amended or revoked an anatomical gift in any document specified in subsection (c)(3) or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615. (2) If the requirements of paragraph (1) are met, the following shall apply: (i) Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (c)(3), the organ procurement organization may conduct a blood or tissue test or minimally invasive examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of a part that is or may be the subject of an anatomical gift. Testing and examination under this subparagraph shall comply with a denial or refusal to make an anatomical gift or any limitation expressed by the individual with respect to the part of the body to donate or a limitation in the provision of a ventilator or other life-sustaining measures, as specified in subsection (c)(3) or a revocation or amendment to an anatomical gift as specified in a document in subsection (c)(3) or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615. The results of tests and examinations under this subparagraph shall be used or disclosed only: (A) to evaluate medical suitability for donation and to facilitate the donation process; and (B) as required or permitted by law. (ii) Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (c)(3), the hospital may not withdraw any measures which are necessary to maintain the medical suitability of the part until the organ procurement organization or designated requestor, as appropriate, has had the opportunity to advise the applicable persons as set forth in section 8611(b) of the option to make an anatomical gift and has received or been denied authorization to proceed with recovery of the part. (3) (Deleted by amendment). (4) (Deleted by amendment). (e) Testing after death.-- Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (c)(3), after an individual's death, a person to whom an anatomical gift may pass under section 8612 (relating to persons who may become donees; purposes for which anatomical gifts may be made) may conduct a test or examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose. (1) (Deleted by amendment). (2) (Deleted by amendment). (3) (Deleted by amendment). (4) (Deleted by amendment). (f) Guidelines.-- (1) The Department of Health, in consultation with organ procurement organizations, tissue procurement providers and the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, donor recipients and family appointed pursuant to section 8622(c)(3) (relating to The Governor Robert P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Trust Fund) shall, within six months of the effective date of this subchapter, do all of the following: (i) Establish guidelines regarding efficient procedures facilitating the delivery of anatomical gift donations from receiving hospitals to organ procurement organizations and tissue providers.

This subsection includes medical, dental and other health-related records. (f.2) Recipients.-- (1) Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, the rights of the person to whom a part passes under section 8612 shall be superior to the rights of all others with respect to the part. The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part. (2) Subject to the wishes of the individual under subsection (c)(3) and this subchapter, a person that accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial or cremation and the use of remains in a funeral service. If the gift is of a part, the person to whom the part passes under section 8612, upon the death of the individual and before embalming, burial or cremation, shall cause the part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation. (f.3) Physicians.-- (1) Neither the physician who attends the individual at death nor the physician who determines the time of the individual's death may participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part from the individual. (2) Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (c)(3), and subject to paragraph (1), a physician or technician may remove a donated part from the body of an individual that the physician or technician is qualified to remove. (f.4) Coordination of procurement and use.-- (1) A hospital shall enter into agreements or affiliations with organ procurement organizations for coordination of procurement and use of anatomical gifts. (2) The organ procurement organization, hospital personnel and other individuals involved in the anatomical donation process shall limit the testing and examination of the individual under this section so as to comply with the wishes of the individual under subsection (c)(3). (g) Death record review.-- (1) The Department of Health shall make annual death record reviews at acute care general hospitals to determine their compliance with subsection (a). (2) To conduct a review of an acute care general hospital, the following apply: (i) The department shall select to carry out the review the Commonwealth-licensed organ procurement organization designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the region within which the acute care general hospital is located. For an organ procurement organization to be selected under this subparagraph, the organization must not operate nor have an ownership interest in an entity which provides all of the functions of a tissue procurement provider. (ii) If there is no valid selection under subparagraph (i) or if the organization selected under subparagraph (i) is unwilling to carry out the review, the department shall select to carry out the review any other Commonwealth-licensed organ procurement organization. For an organ procurement organization to be selected under this subparagraph, the organization must not operate nor have an ownership interest in an entity which provides all of the functions of a tissue procurement provider. (iii) If there is no valid selection under subparagraph (ii) or if the organization selected under subparagraph (ii) is unwilling to carry out the review, the department shall carry out the review using trained department personnel. (3) There shall be no cost assessed against a hospital for a review under this subsection. (4) If the department finds, on the basis of a review under this subsection, that a hospital is not in compliance with subsection (a), the department may impose an administrative fine of up to $500 for each instance of noncompliance. A fine under this paragraph is subject to 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 Subch. A (relating to practice and procedure of Commonwealth agencies) and Ch. 7 Subch. A (relating to judicial review of Commonwealth agency action). Fines collected under this paragraph shall be deposited into the fund.

(a) Right to required information.-- Within 10 days after receipt by a limited partnership of a demand made in record form, a limited partner may inspect and copy required information during regular business hours in the partnership's principal office. The limited partner need not have any particular purpose for seeking the information. (b) Right to other information.-- During regular business hours and at a reasonable location specified by the limited partnership, a limited partner may inspect and copy information, other than the required information, regarding the activities, affairs, financial condition and other circumstances of the partnership if: (1) the limited partner seeks the information for a purpose reasonably related to the partner's interest as a limited partner; (2) the limited partner makes a demand in record form received by the partnership, describing with reasonable particularity the information sought and the purpose for seeking the information; and (3) the information sought is directly connected to the limited partner's purpose. (c) Rights of person dissociated as limited partner.-- Subject to subsection (h), on demand made in record form received by a limited partnership, a person dissociated as a limited partner may have access to information to which the person was entitled while a limited partner if: (1) the information pertains to the period during which the person was a limited partner; (2) in seeking the information the person complies with section 8635(a) (relating to limited duties of limited partners) as if still a limited partner; and (3) the person satisfies the requirements imposed on a limited partner by subsection (b). (d) Required response to demand.-- Within 10 days after receiving a demand under subsection (b) or (c), the limited partnership shall inform in record form the person that made the demand of: (1) what information the partnership will provide in response to the demand and when and where the partnership will provide the information; and (2) the partnership's reasons for declining, if the partnership declines to provide any demanded information. (e) Copying costs.-- A limited partnership may charge a person that makes a demand under this section the reasonable costs of copying. (f) Rights of agent or guardian.-- A limited partner or person dissociated as a limited partner may exercise the rights under this section through an agent or, in the case of an individual under legal disability, a guardian. Any restriction or condition imposed by the partnership agreement or under subsection (h) applies both to the agent or guardian and to the limited partner or person dissociated as a limited partner. (g) No rights of transferee.-- Subject to section 8674 (relating to power of personal representative of deceased partner), the rights under this section do not extend to a person as transferee. (h) Limitations on access.-- In addition to any restriction or condition stated in its partnership agreement, a limited partnership, as a matter within the ordinary course of its activities and affairs, may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on access to and use of information to be furnished under this section, including designating information confidential and imposing nondisclosure and safeguarding obligations on the recipient. In a dispute concerning the reasonableness of a restriction under this subsection, the partnership has the burden of proving reasonableness. (i) Enforcement of right to information.-- If the limited partnership, or a general partner or agent thereof, refuses to permit an inspection sought by a limited partner or person dissociated as a limited partner or attorney or other agent acting for the limited partner or person dissociated as a limited partner pursuant to subsection (a), (b) or (c), or does not reply to the demand made under any of those subsections within 10 days after the demand has been received, the limited partner may file an action in the court for an order to compel the inspection. The court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether or not the person seeking inspection is entitled to the inspection sought. The court may summarily order the limited partnership to permit the limited partner to inspect the information and to make copies or extracts therefrom.

(b) Duty of loyalty.-- The fiduciary duty of loyalty of a general partner includes the duties: (1) to account to the limited partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the general partner: (i) in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's activities and affairs; (ii) from a use by the general partner of the partnership's property; or (iii) from the appropriation of a partnership opportunity; (2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's activities and affairs as or on behalf of a person having an interest adverse to the partnership; and (3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership's activities and affairs. (c) Duty of care.-- The duty of care of a general partner in the conduct or winding up of the limited partnership's activities and affairs is to refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, willful or intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law. (d) Good faith and fair dealing.-- A general partner shall discharge the duties and obligations under this title or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistent with the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (e) Self-serving conduct.-- A general partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this title or under the partnership agreement solely because the general partner's conduct furthers the general partner's own interest. (f) Authorization or ratification.-- All the partners of a limited partnership may authorize or ratify, after full disclosure of all material facts, a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty of a general partner. (g) Fairness as a defense.-- It is a defense to a claim under subsection (b)(2) and any comparable claim in equity or at common law that the transaction was fair to the limited partnership at the time it is authorized or ratified under subsection (f). (h) Rights and obligations in approved transactions.-- If a general partner enters into a transaction with the limited partnership which otherwise would be prohibited by subsection (b)(2) and the transaction is authorized or ratified as provided in subsection (f) or the partnership agreement, the general partner's rights and obligations arising from the transaction are the same as those of a person that is not a general partner.

(c) Foreclosure.-- Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time, the court may foreclose the lien and order the sale of the transferable interest. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a partner and is subject to section 8672 (relating to transfer of transferable interest). (d) Satisfaction of judgment.-- At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), the partner or transferee whose transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subsection (a) may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order. (e) Purchase of rights.-- At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), a limited partnership or one or more partners whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order. (f) Exemption laws preserved.-- This chapter shall not deprive any partner or transferee of the benefit of any exemption law applicable to the transferable interest of the partner or transferee. (g) Exclusive remedy.-- This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a person seeking, in the capacity of a judgment creditor, to enforce a judgment against a partner or transferee may satisfy the judgment from the judgment debtor's transferable interest.

(a) General rule.-- If a limited partnership or the general partners receive a demand to bring an action to enforce a right of the partnership, or if a derivative action is commenced before demand has been made on the partnership or the general partners, the general partners may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the demand or action and to determine on behalf of the limited partnership or recommend to the general partners whether pursuing any of the claims asserted is in the best interests of the partnership. The partnership must deliver a notice in record form to the person making the demand, or to the plaintiff if a derivative action has been commenced, promptly after the appointment of the committee under this section notifying the person making the demand or the plaintiff that a committee has been appointed and identifying by name the members of the committee. (b) Discovery stay.-- If the general partners appoint a special litigation committee and an action is commenced before a determination has been made under subsection (e): (1) On motion by the limited partnership, or the committee made in the name of the partnership, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation, except for good cause shown. (2) The time for the defendants to plead shall be tolled until the process provided for under subsection (f) has been completed. (c) Composition of committee.-- A special litigation committee shall be composed of two or more individuals who: (1) are not interested in the claims asserted in the demand or action; (2) are capable as a group of objective judgment in the circumstances; and (3) may, but need not, be general or limited partners. (c.1) Committee members who are not general partners.-- A member of a special litigation committee who is not a general partner, when acting as a member of the committee, is subject to the liabilities imposed, and entitled to the rights and immunities conferred, by sections 8648 (relating to reimbursement, indemnification, advancement and insurance) and 8649 (relating to standards of conduct for general partners). (d) Appointment of committee.-- A special litigation committee may be appointed: (1) by a majority of the general partners not named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action; or (2) if all general partners are named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action, by a majority of the general partners so named. (e) Determination.-- After appropriate investigation by a special litigation committee, the committee may determine, or the committee may recommend to the general partners that the general partners determine, that it is in the best interests of the limited partnership that: (1) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand not be brought by the partnership but that the partnership not object to an action being brought by the party that made the demand; (2) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be brought by the partnership; (3) some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; (4) an action not be brought based on any of the claims asserted in the demand; (5) an action already commenced continue under the control of: (i) the plaintiff; (ii) the limited partnership; or (iii) the committee; (6) some or all of the claims asserted in an action already commenced be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; or (7) an action already commenced be dismissed. (f) Court review and action.-- If a special litigation committee is appointed and a derivative action is commenced before or after either the committee makes a determination under subsection (e) or the general partners determine under that subsection to accept the recommendation of the committee: (1) The limited partnership or the committee shall file with the court after a determination is made under subsection (e) a statement of the determination and a report of the committee supporting the determination. The partnership or the committee shall serve each party with a copy of the determination and report. If the partnership or the committee moves to file the report under seal, the report shall be served on the parties subject to an appropriate stipulation agreed to by the parties or a protective order issued by the court. (2) The partnership or the committee shall file with the court a motion, pleading or notice consistent with the determination under subsection (e). (3) If the determination is one described in subsection (e)(2), (3), (4), (5)(ii), (6) or (7), the court shall determine whether the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its determination or recommendation in good faith, independently and with reasonable care. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the committee did not meet those qualifications or act in the required manner. If the court finds that the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and that the committee acted in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee or the general partners. Otherwise, the court shall: (i) dissolve any stay of discovery entered under subsection (b); (ii) allow the action to continue under the control of the plaintiff; and (iii) permit the defendants to file preliminary objections and other appropriate motions and pleadings. (g) Attorney General.-- Nothing in this section shall limit the rights, powers and duties of the Attorney General under other applicable law with respect to a limited partnership organized for a charitable purpose. (h) Interest of a defendant.-- The fact that a person is named as a defendant does not make the person interested in the claims asserted in a demand or action for purposes of subsection (c)(1) if the claims against the person: (1) are based only on an allegation that the person approved of or acquiesced in the transaction or conduct that is the subject of the claims; and (2) do not otherwise allege with particularity facts that, if true, raise a significant prospect that the person would be adjudged liable.

(g) Manager's rights in approved transaction.-- If a manager enters into a transaction with the limited liability company which otherwise would be prohibited by subsection (b)(2), and the transaction is approved or ratified as provided by subsection (e) or the operating agreement, the manager's rights and obligations arising from the transaction are the same as those of a person that is not a manager.

(2) The company shall furnish to each member, without demand, any information concerning the company's activities, affairs, financial condition and other circumstances which the company knows and is material to the proper exercise of the member's rights and duties under the operating agreement or this title, except to the extent the company can establish that it reasonably believes the member already knows the information. (3) The duty to furnish information under paragraph (2) also applies to each member to the extent the member knows any of the information described in paragraph (2). (b) In manager-managed company.-- In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply: (1) The informational rights stated in subsection (a) and the duty stated in subsection (a)(3) apply to the managers and not the members. (2) During regular business hours and at a reasonable location specified by the company, a member may inspect and copy full information regarding the activities, affairs, financial condition and other circumstances of the company as is just and reasonable if: (i) the member seeks the information for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member; (ii) the member makes a demand in record form received by the company describing with reasonable particularity the information sought and the purpose for seeking the information; and (iii) the information sought is directly connected to the member's purpose. (3) Within 10 days after receiving a demand under paragraph (2)(ii), the company shall, in record form, inform the member that made the demand of: (i) the information that the company will provide in response to the demand and when and where the company will provide the information; and (ii) the company's reasons for declining, if the company declines to provide any demanded information. (c) Rights of person dissociated as member.-- Subject to subsection (h), within 10 days after receipt by a limited liability company of a demand made in record form, a person dissociated as a member may have access to information to which the person was entitled while a member if: (1) the information pertains to the period during which the person was a member; (2) the person seeks the information in good faith; and (3) the person satisfies the requirements imposed on a member under subsection (b)(2).

Any restriction or condition imposed by the operating agreement or under subsection (h) applies both to the agent or guardian and the member or person dissociated as a member. (g) No rights of transferee.-- Subject to section 8854 (relating to power of personal representative of deceased member), the rights under this section do not extend to a person as transferee. (h) Limitations on access.-- In addition to any restriction or condition stated in the operating agreement, a limited liability company, as a matter within the ordinary course of its activities and affairs, may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on access to and use of information to be furnished under this section, including designating information confidential and imposing nondisclosure and safeguarding obligations on the recipient. In a dispute concerning the reasonableness of a restriction under this subsection, the company has the burden of proving reasonableness. (i) Enforcement of right to information.-- If a limited liability company, or a manager, member or agent thereof, refuses to permit an inspection sought by a person or attorney or other agent acting for the person pursuant to this section, or does not reply to the demand made under this section within 10 days after the demand has been received, the person seeking inspection may file an action in the court for an order to compel the inspection. The court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether or not the person seeking inspection is entitled to the inspection sought. The court may summarily order the company to permit the person to inspect the information and to make copies or extracts therefrom.

(a) Permit.-- Every municipality, third-party agency or the Department of Labor and Industry responsible for the issuance of building permits or demolition permits shall forward a copy of each permit to the county assessment office on or before the first day of every month. In addition to any charge otherwise permitted by law, a municipality, a third-party agency or the Department of Labor and Industry may charge an additional fee of $10 to each person to whom a permit is issued for administrative costs incurred in compliance with this section. The assessment office may provide for the electronic submission of a permit through electronic mail or any other means of electronic transmission or uploading of the permit in its existing form. The provision of permits or permit information to the assessment office as required by this section shall not be subject to the procedures of the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law. No agency, public official or public employee shall be liable for civil or criminal damages or penalties for complying with this section. (a.1) Noncompliance.-- (1) If the county assessment office has reason to believe that there is noncompliance with subsection (a), the assessment office shall provide written notice to the municipality and, if applicable, a third-party agency, or to the Department of Labor and Industry in the case of noncompliance by the Department of Labor and Industry. Upon receipt of the notice, the municipality, third-party agency or Department of Labor and Industry shall investigate and consult with the assessment office and take any steps the municipality, third-party agency or Department of Labor and Industry deems necessary to remediate the noncompliance. (2) If, after consultation, noncompliance with subsection (a) continues, the assessment office may, in the case of continuing noncompliance after notice by a municipality or third-party agency, institute an action in mandamus before the court of common pleas to compel compliance with subsection (a). Should the court determine that the noncompliance is intentional, the court shall award any costs, disbursements, reasonable attorney fees and witness fees relating to the action to the assessment office. (b) Substantial improvement.-- If a person makes improvements to any real property, other than painting of or normal regular repairs to a building, aggregating more than $4,000 in value and a building permit is not required for the improvements, the property owner shall furnish the following information to the board: (1) the name and address of the person owning the property; (2) a description of the improvements made or to be made to the property; and (3) the dollar value of the improvements. (b.1) County improvement certification form.-- The county commissioners may, by ordinance, require that all persons making substantial improvements to property as set forth in subsection (b) submit to the county assessment office a county improvement certification form setting forth the information in subsection (b) prior to beginning any substantial improvement, regardless of whether a building permit is required. The county may provide for the electronic submission of the form and a fee no greater than $5. The county may cooperate with a municipality, third-party agency or the Department of Labor and Industry in the distribution of forms. (c) Civil penalty.-- (1) The board may assess a civil penalty of not more than $100 upon a person for intentionally failing to comply with the provisions of subsection (b) or an ordinance enacted in accordance with subsection (b.1) or intentionally falsifying the information required. (2) If a civil penalty is assessed against a person under paragraph (1), the board must notify the person by certified mail of the nature of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty and that the person may notify the board in writing within 10 calendar days that the person wishes to contest the civil penalty. If, within 10 calendar days from the receipt of that notification, the person does not notify the county board of assessment of the person's intent to contest the assessed penalty, the civil penalty shall become final. (3) If timely notification of the intent to contest the civil penalty is given, the person contesting the civil penalty shall be provided with a hearing in accordance with 2 Pa.C.S. Chs. 5 Subch. B (relating to practice and procedure of local agencies) and 7 Subch. B (relating to judicial review of local agency action). (d) Existing provisions preserved.-- Nothing in this section shall supersede or preempt any ordinance, resolution or other requirement of a county to submit information on substantial improvements in effect on the effective date of this subsection. (e) Substantial improvement value.-- Beginning January 1 of the year immediately following the effective date of this subsection and each January 1 thereafter, the amount set forth in subsection (b) shall be increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland area, for the most recent 12-month period that figures have been officially reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics immediately prior to the date the adjustment is due to take effect.

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided in subsection (b), in any action or proceeding brought by one or more members or managers of a limited liability company to enforce rights that the plaintiff claims could be, but have not been, asserted by the company, each plaintiff has standing to commence and maintain the derivative action if the plaintiff: (1) was a member or manager of the company at the time of the transaction or conduct of which the plaintiff complains, or that the plaintiff's status as a member or manager devolved upon the plaintiff by operation of law from a person who was a member or manager at that time; and (2) continues to be a member or manager until the time of judgment, unless the failure to do so is the result of company action that: (i) was done merely to eliminate derivative claims; or (ii) has the effect of a reorganization that does not affect the plaintiff's ownership of the business enterprise. (b) Exception.-- Any member or manager that, except for the provisions of subsection (a), would be entitled to maintain the action or proceeding and who does not meet such requirements may, nevertheless in the discretion of the court, be allowed to maintain the action or proceeding on preliminary showing to the court, by application and upon such verified statements and depositions as may be required by the court, that there is a strong prima facie case in favor of the claim asserted on behalf of the company and that without the action serious injustice will result. (c) Security for costs.-- In any action or proceeding instituted or maintained by members holding transferable interests entitled to receive less than 5% of any distribution by a limited liability company, unless the transferable interests held by the members have an aggregate fair market value in excess of $200,000, the company in whose right the action or proceeding is brought shall be entitled at any stage of the proceedings to require the plaintiffs to give security for the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, that may be incurred by the company in connection therewith or for which it may become liable pursuant to section 8848(b) (relating to reimbursement, indemnification, advancement and insurance) to which security the company shall have recourse in such amount as the court determines upon the termination of the action or proceeding. The amount of security may, from time to time, be increased or decreased in the discretion of the court upon showing that the security provided has or may become inadequate or excessive. The security may be denied or limited by the court if the court finds after an evidentiary hearing that undue hardship on plaintiffs and serious injustice would result. (d) Failure to maintain ownership.-- If a plaintiff loses the right to maintain a derivative action under subsection (a)(2), the court may entertain a motion by the limited liability company to substitute the limited liability company as the named plaintiff.

(a) General rule.-- If a limited liability company or its members or managers receive a demand to bring an action to enforce a right of the company, or if a derivative action is commenced before demand has been made on the company or its members or managers, the members in a member-managed limited liability company, or the managers in a manager-managed limited liability company, may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the demand or action and to determine on behalf of the company or recommend to the managers or members whether pursuing any of the claims asserted is in the best interests of the company. The company must deliver a notice in record form to the person making the demand, or to the plaintiff if a derivative action has been commenced, promptly after the appointment of a committee under this section notifying the person making the demand or the plaintiff that a committee has been appointed and identifying by name the members of the committee. A committee may not be appointed under this section if: (1) every member of the company is also a manager of the company; or (2) the company is member-managed and every member is actively involved in the management of the company. (b) Discovery stay.-- If the members or managers appoint a special litigation committee and an action is commenced before a determination has been made under subsection (e): (1) On motion by the limited liability company, or the committee made in the name of the company, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation, except for good cause shown. (2) The time for the defendants to plead shall be tolled until the process provided for under subsection (f) has been completed. (c) Composition of committee.-- A special litigation committee shall be composed of two or more individuals who: (1) are not interested in the claims asserted in the demand; (2) are capable as a group of objective judgment in the circumstances; and (3) may, but need not, be members or managers. (c.1) Committee members who are not managers.-- A member of a special litigation committee who is not a manager, when acting as a member of the committee, is subject to the liabilities imposed, and entitled to the rights and immunities conferred, by sections 8848 (relating to reimbursement, indemnification, advancement and insurance) and 8849.2 (relating to standards of conduct for managers). (d) Appointment of committee.-- A special litigation committee may be appointed: (1) in a member-managed limited liability company: (i) by a majority of the members not named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action; and (ii) if all members are named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action, by a majority of the members so named; or (2) in a manager-managed limited liability company: (i) by a majority of the managers not named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action; and (ii) if all managers are named as actual or potential parties in the demand or action, by a majority of the managers so named. (e) Determination.-- After appropriate investigation by a special litigation committee, the committee may determine, or the committee may recommend to the managers or members that they determine, that it is in the best interests of the limited liability company that: (1) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand not be brought by the company but that the company not object to an action being brought by the party that made the demand: (2) an action based on some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be brought by the company; (3) some or all of the claims asserted in the demand be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; (4) an action not be brought based on any of the claims asserted in the demand; (5) an action already commenced continue under the control of: (i) the plaintiff; (ii) the company; or (iii) the committee; (6) some or all of the claims asserted in an action already commenced be settled on terms determined or recommended by the committee; or (7) an action already commenced be dismissed. (f) Court review and action.-- If a special litigation committee is appointed and a derivative action is commenced either before or after either the committee makes a determination under subsection (e) or the members or managers determine under that subsection to accept the recommendation of the committee: (1) The limited liability company or the committee shall file with the court after a determination is made under subsection (e) a statement of the determination and a report of the committee supporting the determination. The company or the committee shall serve each party with a copy of the determination and report. If the company or the committee moves to file the report under seal, the report shall be served on the parties subject to an appropriate stipulation agreed to by the parties or a protective order issued by the court. (2) The company or the committee shall file with the court a motion, pleading or notice consistent with the determination under subsection (e). (3) If the determination is one described in subsection (e)(2), (3), (4), (5)(ii), (6) or (7), the court shall determine whether the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its determination or recommendation in good faith, independently and with reasonable care. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the committee did not meet those qualifications or act in the required manner. If the court finds that the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and that the committee acted in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee or the members or managers. Otherwise, the court shall: (i) dissolve any stay of discovery entered under subsection (b); (ii) allow the action to continue under the control of the plaintiff; and (iii) permit the defendants to file preliminary objections and other appropriate motions and pleadings. (g) Attorney General.-- Nothing in this section shall limit the rights, powers and duties of the Attorney General under other applicable law with respect to a limited liability company organized for a charitable purpose. (h) Interest of a defendant.-- The fact that a person is named as a defendant does not make the person interested in the claims asserted in a demand or action for purposes of subsection (c)(1) if the claims against the person: (1) are based only on an allegation that the person approved of or acquiesced in the transaction or conduct that is the subject of the claims; and (2) do not otherwise allege with particularity facts that, if true, raise a significant prospect that the person would be adjudged liable.

(a) General rule.-- Every domestic restricted professional company in existence on December 31 of any year and every qualified foreign restricted professional company that is registered to do business in this Commonwealth on December 31 of any year shall file in the Department of State with respect to that year, and on or before April 15 of the following year, a certificate of annual registration on a form provided by the department, executed by the company and accompanied by the annual registration fee prescribed by subsection (b). The department shall not charge a fee other than the annual registration fee for filing the certificate of annual registration. The certificate of annual registration shall include a statement by the company as to whether or not it engaged in any business not permitted by section 8996(a) (relating to purposes of restricted professional companies) during the year with respect to which the certificate is being filed. (b) Annual registration fee.-- (1) The annual registration fee to be paid when filing a certificate of annual registration shall be equal to a base fee of $300 times the number of persons who: (i) were members of the company on December 31 of the year with respect to which the certificate of annual registration is being filed; (ii) were licensed persons; and (iii) had their principal residence at the time in this Commonwealth. (2) The base fee of $300 shall be increased on December 31, 1997, and December 31 of every third year thereafter by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Workers during the most recent three calendar years for which that index is available on the date of adjustment. Each adjustment under this paragraph shall be rounded up to the nearest $10. (c) Notice of annual registration.-- Not later than February 1 of each year, the department shall give notice to every restricted professional company required to file a certificate of annual registration with respect to the preceding year of the requirement to file the certificate. The notice shall state the amount of the base fee payable under subsection (b)(1), as adjusted pursuant to subsection (b)(2), if applicable, and shall be accompanied by the form of certificate to be filed. Failure by the department to give notice to any party or failure by any party to receive notice of the annual registration requirement shall not relieve the party of the obligation to file the certificate. (d) Credit to Corporation Bureau Restricted Account.-- The annual registration fee shall not be deemed to be an amount received by the department under Subchapter C of Chapter 1 (relating to Corporation Bureau and UCC fees) for purposes of section 155 (relating to disposition of funds), except that $25 of the fee shall be credited to the Corporation Bureau Restricted Account. (e) Functions of Department of State.-- The department shall send to the Department of Revenue a copy of any certificate that discloses the conduct of any business not permitted by section 8996(a). (f) Annual fee to be lien.-- (1) Failure to file the certificate of annual registration required by this section shall not affect the existence or status of the restricted professional company as such, but the annual registration fee that would have been payable shall be a lien in the manner provided in this subsection from the time the annual registration fee is due and payable. If a certificate of annual registration is not filed within 30 days after the date on which it is due, the department shall assess a penalty of $500 against the company, which shall also be a lien in the manner provided in this subsection. The imposition of that penalty shall not be construed to relieve the company from liability for any other penalty or interest provided for under other applicable law. (2) If the annual registration fee paid by a restricted professional company is subsequently determined to be less than should have been paid because it was based on an incorrect number of members or was otherwise incorrectly computed, that fact shall not affect the existence or status of the restricted professional company as such, but the amount of the additional annual registration fee that should have been paid shall be a lien in the manner provided in this subsection from the time the incorrect payment is discovered by the department. (3) The annual registration fee shall bear simple interest from the date that it becomes due and payable until paid. The interest rate shall be that provided for in section 806 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code, with respect to unpaid taxes. The penalty provided for in paragraph (1) shall not bear interest. The payment of interest shall not relieve the restricted professional company from liability for any other penalty or interest provided for under other applicable law. (4) The lien created by this subsection shall attach to all of the property and proceeds thereof of the restricted professional company in which a security interest can be perfected, in whole or in part, by filing in the department under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9 (relating to secured transactions; sales of accounts, contract rights and chattel paper), whether the property and proceeds are owned by the company at the time the annual registration fee or any penalty or interest becomes due and payable or whether the property and proceeds are acquired thereafter. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the lien created by this subsection shall have priority over all other liens, security interests or other charges, except liens for taxes or other charges due the Commonwealth. The lien created by this subsection shall be entered on the records of the department and indexed in the same manner as a financing statement filed under 13 Pa.C.S. Div. 9. At the time an annual registration fee, penalty or interest that has resulted in the creation of a lien under this subsection is paid, the department shall terminate the lien with respect to that annual registration fee, penalty or interest without requiring a separate filing by the company for that purpose. (5) If the annual registration fee paid by a restricted professional company is subsequently determined to be more than should have been paid for any reason, no refund of the additional fee shall be made.
