A manager may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the members without notice or cause.\n\n(5) A person need not be a member to be a manager, except that the dissociation of a member that is also a manager removes the person as a manager. If a person that is both a manager and a member ceases to be a manager, that cessation does not by itself dissociate the person as a member.\n\n(6) A person's ceasing to be a manager does not discharge any debt, obligation or other liability to the limited liability company or members which the person incurred while a manager.\n\n(d) Action by consent or proxy.--An action requiring the vote or consent of members under this title may be taken without a meeting, and a member may appoint a proxy or other agent to vote, consent or otherwise act for the member by signing an appointing document in record form, personally or by the member's agent.\n\n(e) Effect of dissolution.--The dissolution of a limited liability company does not affect the applicability of this section, except that a person that wrongfully causes dissolution of the company loses the right to participate in management as a member and a manager.\n\n(f) Reimbursement of advances.--A limited liability company shall reimburse a member for an advance to the company beyond the amount of capital the member agreed to contribute.\n\n(g) Interest on advance.--A payment or advance made by a member which gives rise to an obligation of the limited liability company under subsection (f) or section 8848(a) (relating to reimbursement, indemnification, advancement and insurance) constitutes a loan to the company which accrues interest from the date of the payment or advance.\n\n(h) No remuneration for services.--A member is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for a member-managed limited liability company, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the activities of the company.\n\n(i) Increased vote requirements.--Whenever the certificate of organization or operating agreement requires for the taking of any action by the members or a class of members a specific number or percentage of votes or consents, the provision of the certificate or agreement setting forth that requirement shall not be amended or repealed by any lesser number or percentage of votes or consents of the members or the class of members. This subsection does not apply to a provision setting forth the right of members to act by unanimous consent in lieu of a meeting.\n\n(j) Exception.--None of the following shall be considered an amendment of the certificate of organization for purposes of the voting rules in subsections (b)(6) and (c)(3)(iii):\n\n(1) a restatement of all the operative provisions of the certificate of organization without change;\n\n(2) a change in the name or registered office of the limited liability company; or\n\n(3) any combination of the foregoing purposes.\n\n(k) Approval of minor amendments.--Unless otherwise provided in record form in the operating agreement, an amendment described in subsection (j) may be made by the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the managers or, in the case of a member-managed limited liability company, of a majority of the members.\n\nCross References.Section 8847 is referred to in sections 8812, 8817, 8848, 8872 of this title.",

Sections 8849.1(f) and 8849.2(e) shall be applicable to a vote, contract or other action under this subsection. A limited liability company may create a fund of any nature, which may, but need not be, under the control of a trustee, or otherwise secure or insure in any manner its indemnification obligations, whether arising under this section or otherwise.\n\n(f) Grounds.--Indemnification under subsection (e) may be granted for any action taken and may be made whether or not the limited liability company would have the power to indemnify the person under any other provision of law except as provided in this section and whether or not the indemnified liability arises or arose from any threatened, pending or completed action by or in the right of the company. Indemnification under subsection (e) is declared to be consistent with the public policy of the Commonwealth.\n\n(g) Limitation.--Indemnification under this section shall not be made in any case where the act giving rise to the claim for indemnification is determined by a court to constitute recklessness, willful misconduct or a knowing violation of law.\n\nCross References.Section 8848 is referred to in sections 8815, 8847, 8883, 8884 of this title.",

The amount of security may, from time to time, be increased or decreased in the discretion of the court upon showing that the security provided has or may become inadequate or excessive. The security may be denied or limited by the court if the court finds after an evidentiary hearing that undue hardship on plaintiffs and serious injustice would result.\n\n(d) Failure to maintain ownership.--If a plaintiff loses the right to maintain a derivative action under subsection (a)(2), the court may entertain a motion by the limited liability company to substitute the limited liability company as the named plaintiff.\n\n(Nov. 3, 2022, P.L.1791, No.122, eff. 60 days)\n\nCross References.Section 8883 is referred to in section 8882 of this title.",

The company or the committee shall serve each party with a copy of the determination and report.

The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the committee did not meet those qualifications or act in the required manner. If the court finds that the members of the committee met the qualifications required under subsection (c)(1) and (2) and that the committee acted in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee or the members or managers. Otherwise, the court shall:\n\n(i) dissolve any stay of discovery entered under subsection (b);\n\n(ii) allow the action to continue under the control of the plaintiff; and\n\n(iii) permit the defendants to file preliminary objections and other appropriate motions and pleadings.\n\n(g) Attorney General.--Nothing in this section shall limit the rights, powers and duties of the Attorney General under other applicable law with respect to a limited liability company organized for a charitable purpose.\n\n(h) Interest of a defendant.--The fact that a person is named as a defendant does not make the person interested in the claims asserted in a demand or action for purposes of subsection (c)(1) if the claims against the person:\n\n(1) are based only on an allegation that the person approved of or acquiesced in the transaction or conduct that is the subject of the claims; and\n\n(2) do not otherwise allege with particularity facts that, if true, raise a significant prospect that the person would be adjudged liable.\n\n(i) Cross reference.--See section 8815(c)(18) (relating to contents of operating agreement).\n\n(Nov. 3, 2022, P.L.1791, No.122, eff. 60 days)\n\n2022 Amendment.Act 122 amended subsecs.
