The consideration of interests and factors in the manner described in this subsection and in subsection (a) shall not constitute a violation of section 512 (relating to standard of care, justifiable reliance and business judgment rule).\n\n(c) Specific applications.--In exercising the powers vested in the corporation, and in no way limiting the discretion of the board of directors, committees of the board and individual directors pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), the fiduciary duty of directors shall not be deemed to require them to act as the board of directors, a committee of the board or an individual director solely because of the effect such action might have on an acquisition or potential or proposed acquisition of control of the corporation or the consideration that might be offered or paid to shareholders or members in such an acquisition.\n\n(d) Presumption.--In assessing whether the standard set forth in section 512 has been satisfied, there shall not be any greater obligation to justify, or higher burden of proof with respect to, any act as the board of directors, any committee of the board or any individual director relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential or proposed acquisition of control of the corporation than is applied to any other act as a board of directors, any committee of the board or any individual director. Notwithstanding section 512(d) and the preceding provision of this subsection, any act as the board of directors, a committee of the board or an individual director relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential or proposed acquisition of control to which a majority of the disinterested directors shall have assented shall be presumed to satisfy the standard set forth in section 512, unless it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the disinterested directors did not assent to such act in good faith after reasonable investigation.\n\n(e) Definition.--The term \"disinterested director\" as used in subsection (d) and for no other purpose means:\n\n(1) A director of the corporation other than:\n\n(i) A director who has a direct or indirect financial or other interest in the person acquiring or seeking to acquire control of the corporation or who is an affiliate or associate of, or was nominated or designated as a director by, a person acquiring or seeking to acquire control of the corporation.\n\n(ii) Depending on the specific facts surrounding the director and the act under consideration, an officer or employee or former officer or employee of the corporation.\n\n(2) A person shall not be deemed to be other than a disinterested director solely by reason of any or all of the following:\n\n(i) The ownership by the director of shares of or a membership in the corporation.\n\n(ii) The receipt as a holder of shares of or as a member of any class or series of any distribution made to all owners of shares of or members of that class or series.\n\n(iii) The receipt by the director of director's fees or other consideration as a director.\n\n(iv) Any interest the director may have in retaining the status or position of director.\n\n(v) The former business or employment relationship of the director with the corporation.\n\n(vi) Receiving or having the right to receive retirement or deferred compensation from the corporation due to service as a director, officer or employee.\n\n(f) Cross reference.--See section 511(b) (relating to alternative provisions).\n\n(Nov. 3, 2022, P.L.1791, No.122, eff. 60 days)\n\n2022 Amendment.Act 122 amended subsecs.
