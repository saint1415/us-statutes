A member is entitled to one vote per membership share on each question that may be presented at any meeting of the members, regardless of the number of shares of stock or membership capital owned by the member. Membership shares shall be issued for a fee determined by the board of directors. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a membership share entitles a member to the rights and obligations of a stockholder of a corporation organized under this title. Upon voluntary or involuntary termination of a member's work in the corporation, the membership share shall be transferred back to the corporation at the time of the termination. The redemption price of a membership share shall be determined solely by reference to the member's internal capital account under section 7706 (relating to internal capital accounts and net worth).\n\n(b) Voting power.--No capital stock other than membership shares shall be granted voting power in a corporation except as provided in section 7720 (relating to amendments of articles) and the articles of incorporation.\n\n(c) Preferred stock.--A corporation may issue as capital stock a class of nonvoting preferred stock upon terms and conditions provided in the articles of incorporation. Preferred stock shall be freely transferable.\n\n(d) Payment for stock.--No corporation may issue a membership share, and no certificate of stock may be issued until fully paid for, except that promissory notes may be accepted by the corporation as full or partial payment if the promissory note requires payment by regular payroll deductions commencing on the date of the member's acceptance for membership in the corporation. The corporation shall hold the membership share or stock as security for the payment of the note, but retention as security shall not affect the member's right to vote and hold office.\n\n(e) Fractional shares and scrip.--Fractional shares of and scrip for common and preferred stock may not be issued by the corporation.\n\n(f) Form of certificates.--Certificates representing shares, membership shares and evidences of a person's equity in a fund, capital investment or other asset of the corporation shall be signed by the president, vice president, treasurer or assistant treasurer and the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation. Facsimiles of signatures are acceptable. These certificates may be sealed with the seal of the corporation or a facsimile.\n\n(g) Dividend and lien.--Dividends may be paid on preferred stock and may be cumulative if the articles of incorporation so provide. A corporation shall have a lien on all of its outstanding preferred stock and dividends declared or accrued for all indebtedness of the holders to the corporation if provision for a lien is stated on the face of the certificate of stock.\n\n(h) Status of membership.--A membership is not a security as defined in section 102 of the act of December 5, 1972 (P.L.1280, No.284), known as the Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972. Sale, redemption and other transactions with respect to membership shares are not governed by the Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972, except that Part IV of that act, relating to fraudulent and prohibited practices, applies.\n\n(i) Sale, transfer and redemption of stock.--The sale, transfer and redemption of stock in the corporation other than membership shares is subject to the Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972.\n\n(j) Issuance without other first offer.--Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a corporation may issue shares without first offering them to shareholders of any class.",

A corporation shall keep at its registered office or principal place of business appropriate, complete and accurate books or records of account, including a record of all salaries, per diem payments and other remunerations paid to each officer and director by the corporation and remuneration received for the corporation's business transactions.\n\n(b) Examination and copies.--A member, upon written demand, has a right to examine during the usual hours for business, for any proper purpose, the share register, books or records of account and records of the proceedings of the members and directors and to make copies or extracts. A proper purpose is a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a stockholder. If an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right of inspection, the demand shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or other writing which authorizes the attorney or other agent to act on behalf of the member. The demand shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in this Commonwealth or at its principal place of business.\n\n(c) Remedy to compel inspection.--\n\n(1) If the corporation refuses to permit an inspection sought by a member under subsection (b) or does not reply to the demand within five business days after the demand has been made, the member may apply to the court of common pleas of the county in which the registered office of the corporation is located for an order to compel inspection. The court of common pleas has exclusive original jurisdiction to determine whether or not the person seeking inspection is entitled to the inspection sought. The court may summarily order the corporation to permit the member to inspect the material and to make copies or extracts. The court may order the corporation to furnish to the member a list of its members as of a specific date on condition that the member first pay to the corporation the reasonable cost of obtaining and furnishing the list and on other conditions as the court deems appropriate.\n\n(2) If the member seeks to inspect the books and records of the corporation, other than its register or list of members, the member must first establish both of the following:\n\n(i) That the member has complied with the provisions of this section respecting the form and manner of making demand for inspection of the document.\n\n(ii) That the inspection sought is for a proper purpose.\n\n(3) If the member seeks to inspect the share register or list of members of the corporation and the member has complied with the provisions of this subsection respecting the form and manner of making demand for inspection of the documents, the burden of proof is on the corporation to establish that the inspection the member seeks is for an improper purpose. The court may, at its discretion, prescribe limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection or award other relief as the court deems just and proper. The court may order books, documents and records, pertinent extracts or authenticated copies to be brought within this Commonwealth and kept in this Commonwealth upon terms and conditions as it prescribes.",

An election for a director shall be by secret ballot.

The consent shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation.\n\n(vii) Each director shall be provided with an updated copy of the articles of the corporation along with proposed amendments.\n\n(3) If the bylaws so provide, the directors of a corporation may be classified in respect to the time for which they shall hold office. In this case each class shall be as nearly equal in number as possible; the term of office of at least one class shall expire in each year; and the members of a class shall not be elected for a shorter period than one year or for a longer period than three years. If, at a meeting, directors of more than one class are to be elected, each class of directors shall be elected in a separate election.\n\n(4) A director may be removed from office by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the members present and voting at a regular meeting or a special meeting called for that purpose. A director may be removed from office for cause by a vote of not less than a majority of the directors then in office, but this removal may be reversed by a vote by a majority of the members present and voting at a special meeting called for that purpose. The bylaws shall provide for the filing of charges of cause, the giving of notice of the charges, an opportunity to be heard and the procedures under which a director may be removed.\n\n(b) Officers.--\n\n(1) The board shall elect a president, a secretary and a treasurer, and may elect one or more vice presidents, and other officers as authorized in the bylaws. Officers must be members. Any two of the offices of vice president, secretary and treasurer may be held by one person.\n\n(2) An officer may be removed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors if, in their judgment, the best interest of the corporation will be served by removal.",
