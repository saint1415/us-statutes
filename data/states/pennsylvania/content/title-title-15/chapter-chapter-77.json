The court may summarily order the corporation to permit the member to inspect the material and to make copies or extracts.

The court may, at its discretion, prescribe limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection or award other relief as the court deems just and proper. The court may order books, documents and records, pertinent extracts or authenticated copies to be brought within this Commonwealth and kept in this Commonwealth upon terms and conditions as it prescribes.",
