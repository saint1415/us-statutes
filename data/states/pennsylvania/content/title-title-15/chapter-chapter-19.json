Such facts may include, without limitation, actions or events within the control of or determinations made by the corporation or a representative of the corporation.\n\n(4) The plan of asset transfer shall be proposed and adopted, and may be amended after its adoption and terminated, by the transferring corporation in the manner provided in Chapter 3 (relating to entity transactions) for the proposal, adoption, amendment and termination of a plan of merger, except section 321(d) (relating to approval by business corporation). The procedures of Chapter 3 shall not be applicable to the person acquiring the property or assets of the transferring corporation. There shall be included in, or enclosed with, the notice of the meeting of the shareholders of the transferring corporation to act on the plan a copy or a summary of the plan and, if Subchapter D of Chapter 15 (relating to dissenters rights) is applicable, a copy of the subchapter and of subsection (c).\n\n(5) In order to make effective the plan of asset transfer so adopted, it shall not be necessary to file any articles or other documents in the Department of State.\n\n(c) Dissenters rights in asset transfers.--\n\n(1) If a shareholder of a transferring corporation that adopts a plan of asset transfer objects to the plan and complies with Subchapter D of Chapter 15, the shareholder shall be entitled to the rights and remedies of dissenting shareholders therein provided, if any.\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a sale pursuant to an order of court having jurisdiction in the premises or a sale pursuant to a plan of asset transfer that requires that all or substantially all of the net proceeds of sale be distributed to the shareholders in accordance with their respective interests within one year after the date of sale or to a liquidating trust.\n\n(3) See sections 1906(c) (relating to dissenters rights upon special treatment) and 2537 (relating to dissenters rights in asset transfers).\n\n(d) Exceptions.--Subsections (b) and (c)(1) shall not apply to a sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the property and assets of a business corporation:\n\n(1) that directly or indirectly owns all of the outstanding shares of another corporation to the other corporation if the voting rights, preferences, limitations or relative rights, granted to or imposed upon the shares of any class of the parent corporation are not altered by the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition;\n\n(2) when made in connection with the dissolution or liquidation of the corporation, which transaction shall be governed by the provisions of Subchapter F (relating to voluntary dissolution and winding up) or G (relating to involuntary liquidation and dissolution), as the case may be; or\n\n(3) when made in connection with a transaction pursuant to which all the assets sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of are simultaneously leased back to the corporation.\n\n(e) Mortgage.--A mortgage, pledge, grant of a security interest or dedication of property to the repayment of indebtedness (with or without recourse) shall not be deemed a sale, lease, exchange or other disposition for the purposes of this section.\n\n(f) Restrictions.--This section shall not be construed to authorize the conversion or exchange of property or assets in fraud of corporate creditors or in violation of law.\n\n(g) Presumption.--The following apply to a determination whether a corporation has sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of all or substantially all, of its property and assets, with or without good will:\n\n(1) A corporation will conclusively be deemed not to have done so if the corporation or any direct or indirect subsidiary controlled by the corporation retains a business activity that represented at the end of its most recently completed fiscal year before the transaction, on a consolidated basis, at least:\n\n(i) 25% of total assets; and\n\n(ii) 25% of either:\n\n(A) income from continuing operations before taxes; or\n\n(B) revenues from continuing operations.\n\n(2) A determination under paragraph (1)(i) may be based on a balance sheet that reflects:\n\n(i) the book values of the assets of the corporation, as reflected on its books and records;\n\n(ii) a valuation that takes into consideration unrealized appreciation and depreciation or other changes in value of the assets of the corporation;\n\n(iii) the current value of the assets of the corporation, either valued separately or valued in segments or as an entirety as a going concern; or\n\n(iv) any other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n(3) A determination under paragraph (1)(ii) may be based on financial statements prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles or such other accounting practices and principles as are used generally by the corporation in the maintenance of its books and records and as are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n(Dec. 18, 1992, P.L.1333, No.169, eff. 60 days; June 22, 2001, P.L.418, No.34, eff. 60 days; Oct. 22, 2014, P.L.2640, No.172, eff.
