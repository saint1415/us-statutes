The certificate operates as provided in subsections (f) and (g).\n\n(j) Cancellation by operation of law.--Unless canceled earlier, an effective certificate of authority is canceled by operation of law five years after the date on which the certificate, or its most recent amendment, becomes effective. The cancellation is effective without recording under subsection (f) or (g).\n\n(k) Effect of certificate of denial.--An effective certificate of denial under section 8434 (relating to certificate of denial):\n\n(1) operates as a restrictive amendment under this section and a certified copy may be recorded as provided in subsection (f)(1) by the partnership or the person that delivered the certificate of denial to the department for filing; and\n\n(2) affects only the authority of a person to bind a partnership with respect to persons that are not partners.\n\n(l) Foreign partnerships.--A foreign partnership, regardless of whether it is registered to do business in this Commonwealth, may deliver a certificate of authority to the department for filing and may record a copy as provided in this section in the same manner and with the same effect is if it were a domestic partnership.\n\n(m) Cross references.--See:\n\nSection 134 (relating to docketing statement).\n\nSection 135 (relating to requirements to be met by filed documents).\n\nSection 136(c) (relating to processing of documents by Department of State).\n\nSection 8418 (relating to signing of filed documents).\n\nSection 8482 (relating to winding up and filing of certificates).\n\nCross References.Section 8433 is referred to in sections 8413, 8431, 8432, 8474 of this title.",

A deferred payment must be adequately secured and bear interest.\n\n(i) Right to bring action.--A person dissociated as a partner may maintain an action against the partnership, under section 8448(b) (relating to actions by partnership and partners), to determine the buyout price of that person's interest, any offsets under subsection (c) or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action must be commenced within 120 days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one year after demand in record form for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered.

      "text": "(a) Creditors.--In winding up its business, a partnership shall apply its assets, including the contributions required by this section, to discharge the partnership's obligations to creditors, including partners that are creditors.\n\n(b) Surplus.--After a partnership complies with subsection (a), any surplus shall be distributed in the following order, subject to any charging order in effect under section 8454 (relating to charging order):\n\n(1) to each owner of a transferable interest that reflects contributions made and not previously returned, an amount equal to the value of the unreturned contributions; and\n\n(2) among owners of transferable interests in proportion to their respective rights to share in distributions immediately before the dissolution of the partnership.\n\n(c) Insufficient assets.--If a partnership's assets are insufficient to satisfy all its obligations under subsection (a), with respect to each unsatisfied obligation incurred when the partnership was not a limited liability partnership, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) Each person that was a partner when the obligation was incurred and that has not been released from the obligation under section 8473(c) (relating to liability of person dissociated as partner to other persons) shall contribute to the partnership for the purpose of enabling the partnership to satisfy the obligation. The contribution due from each of those persons is in proportion to the right to receive distributions when the obligation was incurred.\n\n(2) If a person does not contribute the full amount required under paragraph (1) with respect to an unsatisfied obligation of the partnership, the other persons required to contribute under paragraph (1) on account of the obligation shall contribute the additional amount necessary to discharge the obligation. The additional contribution due from each of those other persons is in proportion to the right to receive distributions when the obligation was incurred.\n\n(3) If a person does not make the additional contribution required under paragraph (2), further additional contributions are determined and due in the same manner as provided in that paragraph.\n\n(d) Recovery of additional contributions.--A person that makes an additional contribution under subsection (c)(2) or (3) may recover from any person whose failure to contribute under subsection (c)(1) or (2) necessitated the additional contribution. A person may not recover under this subsection more than the amount additionally contributed. A person's liability under this subsection shall not exceed the amount the person failed to contribute.\n\n(e) Distributions when surplus insufficient.--If a partnership does not have sufficient surplus to comply with subsection (b)(1), the following shall apply:\n\n(1) If the partnership has been a limited liability partnership at any time during its existence, any surplus must be distributed among the owners of transferable interests in proportion to the value of the respective unreturned contributions.\n\n(2) If the partnership has never been a limited liability partnership, the partners and any person whose dissociation resulted in dissolution shall contribute to the partnership funds sufficient to cause the insufficiency under subsection (b)(1) to be allocated consistently with section 8441(a) (relating to partner's rights and duties).\n\n(f) Form of payment.--All distributions made under subsections (b) and (c) must be paid in money.\n\nCross References.Section 8486 is referred to in sections 8231, 8445, 8471 of this title.",
