The first advertisement shall be published not more than 45 days and the second advertisement not less than ten days prior to the date fixed for the opening of bids. Advertisements for contracts or purchases must also be posted in a conspicuous place within the borough. Advertisements for contracts and purchases must contain the date, time and location for opening of bids and must state the amount of the performance bond determined under subsection (c). The amount of the contract must in all cases, whether of straight sale price, conditional sale, lease, lease purchase or otherwise, be the entire amount which the borough pays to the successful bidder or the bidder's assigns in order to obtain the services or property, or both, and may not be construed to mean only the amount that is paid to acquire title or to receive another particular benefit of the whole bargain.\n\n(a.1) Price quotations.--Written or telephonic price quotations from at least three qualified and responsible contractors must be requested for contracts in excess of the base amount of $10,000, subject to adjustment under subsection (a.2), and less than the amount requiring advertisement and competitive bidding, or, in lieu of price quotations, a memorandum must be kept on file showing that fewer than three qualified contractors exist in the market area within which it is practicable to obtain quotations. A written record of telephonic price quotations must be made and must contain at least the date of the quotation, the name of the contractor and the contractor's representative, the construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or work that was the subject of the quotation and the price.

The sums must be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the new final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (a) and (a.1).\n\n(5) The determinations and adjustments required under this subsection must be made in the period between October 1 and November 15 of each year.\n\n(6) The final adjusted base amounts and new final adjusted base amounts obtained under paragraphs (3) and (4) become effective January 1 for the calendar year following the year in which the determination required under paragraph (1) is made.\n\n(7) The Department of Labor and Industry shall publish notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin prior to January 1 of each calendar year of the annual percentage change determined under paragraph (1) and the unadjusted or final adjusted base amounts determined under paragraphs (3) and (4) at which competitive bidding is required under subsection (a) and written or telephonic price quotations are required under subsection (a.1), respectively, for the calendar year beginning January 1 after publication of the notice. The notice must include a written and illustrative explanation of the calculations performed by the department in establishing the unadjusted or final adjusted base amounts under this subsection for the ensuing calendar year.\n\n(8) The annual increase in the preliminary adjusted base amounts obtained under paragraphs (3) and (4) may not exceed 3%.\n\n(b) Awarding contracts and authority of council.--\n\n(1) The award of contracts must be made by public announcement at the meeting at which bids are received, or at a subsequent meeting, the time and place of which shall be publicly announced when bids are received.
