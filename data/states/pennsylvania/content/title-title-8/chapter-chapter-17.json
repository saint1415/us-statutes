      "text": "(a) Streets deemed to be laid out.--A street identified in a plan of streets, an official map adopted in accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code or a recorded subdivision or land development plan is deemed to be laid out for purposes of this part.\n\n(b) Future street opening.--A borough has the authority, by ordinance, to lay out an area for future opening as a public street. The proposed ordinance laying out the street must be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for two successive weeks. On or before the publication of the first advertisement, personal notice must be provided to the owners of a property abutting the proposed street or through which the proposed street is to be laid out, and, if the proposed street will lead into an adjacent municipality, a copy of the proposed ordinance must be sent to the adjacent municipality. The proposed ordinance must have appended to the ordinance or referenced a map sufficient to apprise the public of the proposed location, profile and dimensions of the street and must list the names of the owners of a property through which the proposed street has been laid out.\n\n(c) Hearing, notice and enactment.--Within ten days after the second publication of the notice required under subsection (b), an interested party may petition council for a hearing, which council shall hold within 60 days after the date of the petition. Council shall give at least 15 days' notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation and by personal notice to persons entitled to the notice under subsection (b). Council may enact the ordinance no later than 30 days following the date of the hearing or, where no timely petition has been filed, within 30 days of the second publication of the notice required by subsection (b). The enactment of the ordinance constitutes public notice of the borough's intent to recognize the street within the system of borough streets and the borough's rights in the street. Within 30 days of the enactment of the ordinance, a party aggrieved by council's action may appeal to the court of common pleas.\n\n(d) Filing of ordinance.--If, at the time of the enactment of an ordinance in accordance with subsection (c), the lines of the laid out street include property not subject to use as a public passageway, the ordinance must be filed with the recorder of deeds of the county where the borough is located. The recorder of deeds shall index the ordinance by name of borough, name of the property owner and, if applicable, parcel number of the property through which the proposed street is laid out.\n\n(e) Landowners.--If a street has been laid out by ordinance as provided in this section, the owner or subsequent owner has no right to damages for buildings or improvements placed on streets after the date of enactment, and the buildings or improvements must be removed at the expense of the landowner after the opening of the street in accordance with this part.\n\n(f) Laying out without opening.--The laying out of a street, without opening the street, creates no right to public use of the street and does not constitute the taking or acceptance of a property or obligate the borough to improve or maintain the street or the property on which the street has been laid out.\n\n(g) Previously laid out streets.--Nothing in this section may affect the validity or legal effect of a street laid out in accordance with law prior to July 16, 2012.\n\nCross References.Section 1721.2 is referred to in sections 1712, 1724 of this title.",

If a structure has been located upon the street or portion of the street so opened, prior to the laying out of the street or prior to the simultaneous laying out and opening of the street, the street may not be opened until the owner of the structure has been given 60 days' personal notice to vacate the structure. Council may not be required to file any bond or security for the exercise of the right granted by this section.\n\n(b) Limitation.--The parties whose ground is taken in the opening of a street or portion of the street have three years from and after the effective date of the ordinance opening the street or portion of the street in which to bring an action for damages resulting from the opening of the street or portion of the street.

      "text": "(a) Requirements.--No person may construct, dedicate or open to travel a street or a drainage facility in connection with the street for public use or travel or for the common use of occupants of buildings abutting thereon in a borough without first submitting suitable plans to the council and obtaining its approval. The plans must:\n\n(1) be prepared in accordance with rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the council; and\n\n(2) show the profiles of the street, the course, structure and capacity of a drainage facility, and the method of drainage of the adjacent or contiguous territory, and any other or further details that may be required under the rules or regulations adopted by the council.\n\n(b) Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.--The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code shall apply to the construction, security requirements and dedication of streets and connected drainage facilities if the streets proposed to be constructed are part of a plan required by an ordinance adopted under the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.\n\n(c) Authority and duties of council.--\n\n(1) Before acting upon plans not subject to review under subsection (b), council may, at its discretion, arrange for a public hearing after giving the notice as it may deem desirable in each case. Council may alter the plans and specify changes or modifications of any kind and may make its approval of the plans subject to alterations, changes or modifications. Plans, when so approved, must be:\n\n(i) signed on behalf of the borough by the officer as the council may designate; and\n\n(ii) must be filed where the plans are available for public inspection among the records of the borough at reasonable times.\n\n(2) No approval of plans by council may obligate or require the borough to construct, reconstruct, maintain, repair or grade a street or drainage facilities associated therewith.\n\n(d) No plan approved.--If the council refuses to approve any plans submitted to it, a person aggrieved by the action of council may, within 30 days after the action, appeal from the action by petition to the court of common pleas of the county, and the court shall hear the matter de novo. After hearing, the court may enter a decree affirming, reversing or modifying the action of the council as may appear just. The court shall designate the manner in which notice of the hearing of an appeal shall be given to all parties interested. The decision of the court shall be final. A plan approved by the action of council or by the court on appeal must be recorded by the person applying for approval in the office of the recorder of deeds in the county.\n\n(e) Restriction.--If a street or a drainage facility in connection with the street is opened, constructed or dedicated for public use or travel, except in strict accordance with a plan approved by the council or the court on appeal as provided in this chapter, neither the council nor any other public authority may place, construct or operate a sewer, drain, water pipe or other facility or do any work in or upon the street. Neither council nor any other public authority has a responsibility with respect to the street or drainage facility, notwithstanding the use of the street or drainage facility by the public. Nothing in this chapter prevents the laying of a trunk sewer, drain or water or gas main, if required by engineering necessity for the accommodation of other territory.\n\n(f) Failure to comply with chapter.--A person who constructs, opens or dedicates a street or drainage facility in connection with a street, for public use or travel in a borough, without having first complied with this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree and is subject to a suit for the costs and damages incurred by the borough or property owners in the course of correcting the substantive violations of State law or borough ordinance resulting from or arising out of the unlawfully constructed street or facility. Nothing under this section may be construed to apply to the Department of Transportation.",
