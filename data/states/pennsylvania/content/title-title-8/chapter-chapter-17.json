The proposed ordinance laying out the street must be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for two successive weeks. On or before the publication of the first advertisement, personal notice must be provided to the owners of a property abutting the proposed street or through which the proposed street is to be laid out, and, if the proposed street will lead into an adjacent municipality, a copy of the proposed ordinance must be sent to the adjacent municipality.
