There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a person has knowingly violated this subsection if the owner or lessor of the road or driveway has placed, at or near the points of entry from public or private vehicular access, a gate, fence or similar obstruction or a readily visible sign that would reasonably convey that the unauthorized operation of motor vehicles on the road or driveway is prohibited. (c) Damage to real property by operation of motor vehicle prohibited.-- It is unlawful for a person to knowingly or recklessly cause damage to any real or personal property by means of the operation of a motor vehicle on private real property. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a person has knowingly or recklessly caused damage under this subsection where digging, ground breakage or other damage to land, sod or soil or damage to trees, growing crops, ornamental flowers or shrubs or other similar flora affixed to the land or to structures, fixtures or personal property affixed to or located on the private real property has resulted from the operation of a motor vehicle on the private real property.

For purposes of this subsection, the term \"cultivated agricultural land\" includes land which is or has been recently groomed or prepared for the purpose of present or future commercial or private agricultural, silvicultural, horticultural or floricultural production, whether or not the land is currently in seed or sustaining growing crops. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a person has knowingly operated a motor vehicle on cultivated agricultural land either if there are agricultural crops or residue from the crops visible on the land or if the owner or lessor of the land has placed near the roadside boundaries of the property visible signs which would easily convey to the operator of a motor vehicle that the land is cultivated agricultural land and that operation of a motor vehicle on it is prohibited. (e) Offense defined.-- The following penalties shall apply: (1) A person who violates subsection (b) commits a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of $100. (2) A person who violates subsection (c) or (d) commits a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be subject to the following penalties: (i) A fine of $500 for a first conviction of the offense. (ii) A fine of $1,000 plus suspension of operating privileges for a period of six months for a second or subsequent conviction of the offense. If a person is under 16 years of age at the time of the second or subsequent conviction of an offense, the period of suspension shall commence upon the person's 16th birthday.
