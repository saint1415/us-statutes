      "text": "(a) Civil penalty.--In addition to proceeding under any other remedy available at law or in equity for a violation of a provision of this chapter or a rule or regulation adopted, order issued or odor management plan or nutrient management plan approved under this chapter, the commission may assess a civil penalty of not more than $500 for the first day of each offense and $100 for each additional day of continuing violation. The factors for consideration in determining the amount of the penalty are:\n\n(1) The gravity of the violation.\n\n(2) The potential harm to the public.\n\n(3) The potential effect on the environment.\n\n(4) The willfulness of the violation.\n\n(5) Previous violations.\n\n(6) The economic benefit to the violator for failing to comply with this chapter.\n\nWhenever the commission finds that a violation did not cause harm to human health or an adverse effect on the environment, the commission may issue a warning in lieu of assessing a penalty where the owner or operator, upon notice, takes immediate action to resolve the violation and come into compliance. If the commission finds the nutrient pollution or the danger of nutrient pollution or the negative impacts from odor associated with new or expanded facilities results from conditions, activities or practices which are being or have been implemented in accordance with a nutrient management plan or odor management plan developed and approved pursuant to and consistent with this chapter and the regulations developed under this chapter and which is being or has been fully implemented and maintained, the owner or operator of the agricultural operation shall be exempt from the imposition of penalties under this chapter.\n\n(b) Collection.--In cases of inability to collect the civil penalty or failure of any person to pay all or a portion of the penalty, the commission may refer the matter to the Office of General Counsel or the Office of Attorney General which shall institute an action in the appropriate court to recover the penalty. Any penalty assessed shall act as a lien on the property of the person against whom the penalty has been assessed.\n\n(c) Civil remedies.--In addition to any other remedies provided for in this chapter, any violation of this chapter, the rules and regulations promulgated under this chapter or any order or nutrient management plan or odor management plan approved under this chapter shall be abatable in the manner provided by law or equity for the abatement of public nuisances. In addition, in order to restrain or prevent any violation of this chapter or the rules and regulations promulgated under this chapter or any order or nutrient management plan or odor management plan approved under this chapter, suits may be instituted in equity or at law in the name of the Commonwealth upon relation of the Attorney General, the General Counsel, the district attorney of any county, the solicitor of any municipality affected or the solicitor of any conservation district, provided that the General Counsel, district attorney or solicitor shall first serve notice upon the Attorney General of the intention to so proceed. These proceedings may be prosecuted in the Commonwealth Court or in the court of common pleas of the county where the activity has taken place, the condition exists or the public is affected, and, to that end, jurisdiction is hereby conferred in law and equity upon these courts. Except in cases of emergency where, in the opinion of the court, the exigencies of the case require immediate abatement of the nuisance, the court may in its decree fix a reasonable time during which the person responsible for the nuisance may make provision for the abatement of same.\n\n(d) Equitable relief.--In cases where the circumstances require it or the public health is endangered, a mandatory preliminary injunction, special injunction or temporary restraining order may be issued upon the terms prescribed by the court, provided that notice of the application has been given to the defendant in accordance with the rules of equity practice. In any such proceeding the Attorney General, the General Counsel, the district attorney or the solicitor of any municipality or conservation district shall not be required to give bond. In any such proceeding, the court shall issue a prohibitory or mandatory preliminary injunction if it finds that the defendant is engaging in unlawful conduct as defined by this chapter or is engaged in conduct which is causing immediate and irreparable harm to the public. In addition to an injunction, the court in such equity proceeding may assess civil penalties in accordance with this section.",
