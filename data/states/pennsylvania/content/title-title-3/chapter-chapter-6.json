The interest earned plus an amount equal to the principal repaid by the borrower shall be remitted not less than semiannually by the lending institution to the State Treasurer.\n\n(ii) If the lending institution is an agricultural credit association in conjunction with the Farm Credit Bank, the face value of the bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities outstanding shall, at the option of the State Treasurer, be periodically reduced by payment or redemption to match as nearly as possible the amount of principal outstanding on program loans, and the interest earned shall be payable to the State Treasurer as due in accordance with the terms of the bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities.\n\n(c) Terms of loan for borrowers.--The terms of the loans for borrowers shall be:\n\n(1) Loans shall not exceed $250,000.\n\n(2) Loans shall be amortized over a term not to exceed 12 years.\n\n(3) The interest rate shall be established at or prior to the approval of the eligible borrower's loan application.\n\n(4) The interest rate charged by a lending institution to an eligible borrower shall reflect a percentage rate reduction below the prevailing market loan interest rate otherwise applicable to the borrower that is equal to the percentage rate reduction, if any, below the rate set by the Board of Finance and Revenue at which the certificates of deposit associated with the loan are placed or at which the investment in bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities of the Farm Credit Bank associated with the loan are made.\n\n(5) The interest rate charged by a lending institution to an eligible borrower may be either a fixed rate for the entire term of the loan or a variable rate which shall be adjusted semiannually to reflect changes in the interest rate established by the Board of Finance and Revenue for deposits in State depositories as otherwise provided by law.\n\n(6) Except as modified by the requirements of this chapter, a lending institution may apply its usual policies and practices with respect to the administration, collection and enforcement of loans issued under this chapter.\n\n(d) Interest subsidy.--\n\n(1) The commission, at the commission's discretion, may enter into an agreement with the State Treasurer to subsidize the interest rate charged to eligible borrowers under this program with money provided to the commission under section 4(6) of the Conservation District Law or section 512 (relating to Nutrient Management Fund).\n\n(2) Under the agreement, the commission may designate from time to time a block of loans of a certain aggregate dollar amount which the commission wishes to subsidize and shall deposit in advance into a restricted escrow account in the State Treasury an amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be sufficient to make the yield over a 12-year term on the Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money to be transferred to lending institutions in connection with each designated block of subsidized loans equivalent to the yield the money otherwise would have earned at interest rates established from time to time by the Board of Finance and Revenue for deposits in State depositories as otherwise provided by law. Withdrawals from the restricted escrow account shall be made by the State Treasurer at the times when interest becomes due and payable from lending institutions on Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money associated with subsidized loans.\n\n(3) Among its terms, the agreement shall contain provisions:\n\n(i) To require the deposit of additional money into the restricted escrow account when the parties agree that the account balance has become insufficient to fully fund the subsidy.\n\n(ii) To permit the withdrawal of money from the escrow account when the parties agree that the account balance exceeds the amount needed to fully fund the subsidy.\n\n(4) The amount to be deposited into the restricted escrow account as to each block of loans designated by the commission shall be determined by calculating that the loans will be amortized over 12 years at a fixed rate of interest which is a number of percentage points below the prevailing market interest rate for such loans, to be designated by the commission.",
