Certification under such program may be for a given category or categories of measuring or weighing devices or for a particular type of device except for commercially used truck-mounted fuel oil meters and retail motor fuel dispensers. The department shall certify only such individuals who:\n\n(i) successfully complete the appropriate training course or courses prescribed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for the type of certification sought and who comply with departmental certification standards promulgated under this paragraph; and\n\n(ii) are not the owner or lessee of the devices tested and inspected or an employee or agent of the owner or lessee of the devices tested and inspected.\n\nAny program instituted under this paragraph shall include testing and inspection performance standards, reporting procedures, random inspection and testing by inspectors of a sample of devices inspected and tested by Certified Examiners of Weights and Measures and any other type of standards or procedures the department deems necessary to implement the program.\n\n(b) Specifics.--These regulations shall include specifications, tolerances and regulations for weights and measures of the character of those specified in section 4112 (relating to general testing and inspections) designed to eliminate from use, without prejudice to apparatus that conforms as closely as practicable to the official standards, those:\n\n(1) that are not accurate;\n\n(2) that are of such construction that they are faulty, that is, that are not reasonably permanent in their adjustment or will not repeat their indications correctly; or\n\n(3) that facilitate the perpetration of fraud.\n\nThe specifications, tolerances and regulations for commercial weighing and measuring devices, together with amendments thereto as recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and published in National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 44, and supplements thereto, or in any publication revising or superseding Handbook 44, shall be the specifications, tolerances and regulations for commercial weighing and measuring devices of the Commonwealth except insofar as specifically modified, amended or rejected by a regulation issued by the department. For the purposes of this subchapter, apparatus shall be deemed to be correct when it conforms to all applicable requirements promulgated as specified in this section; other apparatus shall be deemed to be incorrect.\n\n(c) Method.--Regulations shall be promulgated in the manner prescribed by law.\n\n(d) Reports.--On or before March 1 of each year after the effective date of this subsection, the department shall submit a report to the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee of the Senate and the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives which shall describe all relevant activities of inspectors, Certified Examiners of Weights and Measures and city and county sealers of weights and measures for the preceding calendar year.

It shall be the duty of the department within a 12-month period, or less frequently if in accordance with a schedule issued by it or more frequently if deemed necessary, to assure that all weights and measures commercially used:\n\n(1) in determining the weight, measurement or count of commodities or things sold, offered or exposed for sale on the basis of weight, measure or count; or\n\n(2) in computing the basic charge or payment for services rendered on the basis of weight, measure or count or of devices utilized to dispense services on time;\n\nare inspected and tested to ascertain if they are correct. With respect to single-service devices, that is, devices designed to be used commercially only once and to be then discarded, and with respect to devices uniformly mass produced, as by means of a mold or die and not susceptible to individual adjustment, tests may be made on representative samples of such devices and the lots of which such samples are representative shall be held to be correct or incorrect upon the basis of the results of the inspections and tests on such samples.\n\n(b) Inspections.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), it shall be the duty of the department at intervals not greater than 18 months, to assure that all commercially used vehicle scales, truck-mounted fuel oil meters, truck-mounted liquid petroleum gas meters, compressed natural gas meters and retail motor fuel dispensers are inspected and tested to ascertain if they are correct. The department may accept reports of Certified Examiners of Weights and Measures as sufficient to meet the inspection and testing regulations promulgated under section 4110(a)(4) (relating to specific powers and duties of department; regulations), provided such inspection and testing is performed in accordance with all applicable standards and procedures adopted under section 4110(a)(4), provided that inspectors shall conduct inspection and testing of a sample of devices inspected and tested by Certified Examiners of Weights and Measures.\n\n(b.1) Time.--Unless the department is responding to a consumer complaint, the department shall conduct inspections of truck-mounted fuel oil meters at a mutually agreed upon time. The mutually agreed upon time shall not unreasonably interfere with the delivery of fuel oil during winter months. Both parties shall make a good faith effort to schedule the inspections.\n\n(b.2) Inspection of parking meters.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), if a local government unit, authority organized by a local government unit or person makes use of parking meters, it shall be the duty of the local government unit, the appropriate authority or the person at intervals not greater than 60 months to assure that all such parking meters are inspected and tested to ascertain if they are correct. The local government unit, appropriate authority or person may accept reports of certified parking meter inspectors as sufficient to meet the inspection and testing requirements of this subsection. The department shall make investigations of parking meters under section 4116 (relating to investigations).\n\n(c) General testing and inspection of scanning devices.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the department shall test and inspect all commercially used Universal Product Code scanning systems and Price Look Up devices at intervals not greater than 36 months to ascertain if they are correct. A city or county may test and inspect such devices and systems if specified in its memorandum of understanding entered into with the department in accordance with section 4125 (relating to division of responsibilities). Such devices and systems shall be exempt from the triennial testing and inspection requirements of this subsection if the device or system is inspected at least annually on an unannounced basis as part of a private certification program which conforms with the examination procedures for price verification as adopted by the National Conference of Weights and Measures.\n\n(d) Interim procedures.--In order to facilitate the speedy implementation of subsection (c), the department shall promulgate, adopt and use guidelines to provide for the certification of individuals to test and inspect all commercially used Universal Product Code scanning systems and Price Look Up devices. The guidelines shall be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. The guidelines shall not be subject to review pursuant to section 205 of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law, and sections 204(b) and 301(10) of the act of October 15, 1980 (P.L.950, No.164), known as the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, or the act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as the Regulatory Review Act, and shall be effective for a period of not more than two years.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve the department of the responsibility, prior to June 30, 1999, to conduct tests and inspections of all commercially used Universal Product Code scanning systems and Price Look Up devices on a periodic basis and in response to complaints and to initiate appropriate enforcement actions.\n\n(Mar. 24, 1998, P.L.217, No.39, eff. imd.; Oct. 24, 2012, P.L.1332, No.169, eff. imd.)\n\n2012 Amendment.Act 169 amended subsecs.
