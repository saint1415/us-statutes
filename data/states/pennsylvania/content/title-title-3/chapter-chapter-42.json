The holder of the receipt must display it upon demand to anyone authorized to enforce laws of this Commonwealth. The receipt authorizes sale or possession of the purchased species for a period of 15 days after the date on the receipt. The period of 15 days, however, is inapplicable to species stocked in regulated fishing areas as well as ornamental, aquarium and baitfish species which may be held by dealers until disposed.\n\n(b) Water obstruction.--A person registered under section 4220 (relating to registration for artificial propagation) must obtain prior written approval from the Department of Environmental Protection to erect or place a dam, pond or other device which will prevent the free migration of finfish. This subsection permits dams, ponds and other devices erected prior to January 1, 1980, and used continuously since then to be maintained.\n\n(c) Authorized activities by registrants.--Registration under section 4220 authorizes the registrant to:\n\n(1) carry on the business of propagation and sale of species of fish and eggs thereof which are specified in the registration;\n\n(2) catch and kill the specified species of fish in the specified facility or facilities in the registration by any means except explosives or poison; and\n\n(3) sell, transport or dispose of species of fish and eggs thereof which are specified in the registration. Public transportation companies are authorized to receive and transport species and eggs.\n\n(d) Unauthorized activities by registrants.--\n\n(1) Registration under section 4220 does not authorize registrants to catch species of fish out of natural streams flowing over property of a registrant nor from other waters within this Commonwealth. Transportation of species of fish neither cultivated nor purchased by the registrant is not permitted.\n\n(2) Species of fish or eggs thereof taken from waters within this Commonwealth unoccupied, unowned or uncontrolled by a registrant and uncovered by his registration shall neither be stocked nor maintained in any manner. This paragraph, however, allows the exchange of eggs or the fry of any species of fish with the department and the commission.\n\nCross References.Section 4221 is referred to in section 4223 of this title.",
