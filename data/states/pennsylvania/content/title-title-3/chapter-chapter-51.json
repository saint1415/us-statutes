      "text": "(a) \"Withdrawal from distribution\" orders.--When the department has reasonable cause to believe any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or of any of the prescribed regulations under this chapter, it may issue and enforce a written or printed \"withdrawal from distribution\" order warning the distributor not to dispose of the lot of feed in any manner until written permission is given by the department or a court of competent jurisdiction. The department shall release the lot of commercial feed so withdrawn when the provisions and regulations have been complied with. If compliance is not obtained within 30 days, the department may begin or upon request of the distributor shall begin proceedings for condemnation.\n\n(b) Condemnation and confiscation.--Any lot of commercial feed not in compliance with the provisions and regulations shall be subject to seizure on complaint of the department to a court of competent jurisdiction in the area in which the commercial feed is located. In the event the court finds the commercial feed to be in violation of this chapter and orders the condemnation of the commercial feed, it shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with the quality of the commercial feed and the laws of this Commonwealth. In no instance shall the disposition of the commercial feed be ordered by the court without first giving the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of the commercial feed or for permission to process or relabel the commercial feed to bring it into compliance with this chapter.",
