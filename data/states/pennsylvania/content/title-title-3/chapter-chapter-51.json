Commercial feeds which are distributed to manufacturers and used as ingredients in the manufacture of commercial feeds other than customer-formula feeds and contract feeds are exempted from the inspection fee, but in no case shall the inspection fee paid annually amount to less than $25. The department, having determined after a public hearing following notice to the licensees that moneys derived from the license and inspection fees are either greater or less than that required to administer this chapter, may by regulation reduce or increase the inspection fee so as to maintain revenues sufficient to administer this chapter, but the inspection fee shall not be changed by more than 2¢ in one year, and the inspection fee shall not exceed 20¢ per ton.\n\n(b) Annual statement and records.--Except as otherwise provided, every guarantor who distributes commercial feed in this Commonwealth shall:\n\n(1) File not later than February 15 of each year an annual statement, under oath, setting forth the number of net tons of commercial feeds distributed in this Commonwealth during the preceding calendar year. Upon filing the statement, the guarantor shall pay the inspection fee at the rate stated in subsection (a) or at the rate established by the department by regulation promulgated under subsection (a).

Inspection fees which are due and owing and have not been remitted to the Commonwealth by the due date shall have a penalty fee of 10% or a minimum of $25 added to the amount due when payment is finally made. The assessment of this penalty fee shall not prevent the Commonwealth from taking other actions as provided in this chapter.\n\n(2) Keep such records as may be necessary or required by the department to indicate accurately the tonnage of commercial feeds distributed in this Commonwealth. The department may examine these records to verify statements of tonnage.\n\n(c) Cancellation of license.--Failure to make an accurate statement of tonnage or to pay the inspection fee or comply as provided in this section shall constitute sufficient cause for the cancellation of the license.",

If the feeding of the processed feed will result or is likely to result in a pesticide residue in the edible product of the animal which is unsafe within the meaning of section 408(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it shall be deemed adulterated.\n\n(5) It is, bears or contains any color additive which is unsafe within the meaning of section 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\n(6) It is, bears or contains any new animal drug which is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\n(7) Any valuable constituent has been, in whole or in part, omitted or abstracted therefrom or any less valuable substance substituted therefor.\n\n(8) Its composition or quality falls below or differs from that which it is purported or represented to possess by its labeling.\n\n(9) It contains a drug and the methods used in or the facilities or controls used for its manufacture, processing or packaging do not conform to current good manufacturing practice regulations promulgated by the department to assure that the drug meets the requirements of this chapter as to safety, identity and strength, quality and purity characteristics which the drug purports or is represented to possess.
