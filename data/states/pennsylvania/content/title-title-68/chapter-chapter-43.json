      "text": "(a) Execution and recording of instrument of transfer.--No special declarant rights (section 4103) created or reserved under this subpart may be transferred except by an instrument evidencing the transfer recorded in every county in which any portion of the cooperative is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the cooperative, the transferor and the transferee in both the grantor and grantee index. The instrument is not effective unless executed by the transferee.\n\n(b) Liability of declarant following transfer.--Upon transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant is as follows:\n\n(1) A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed upon him by this subpart. Lack of privity does not deprive any proprietary lessee of standing to bring an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor.\n\n(2) If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant (section 4103), the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any liabilities and or obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to the cooperative.\n\n(3) If a transferor retains any special declarant rights but transfers one or more other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant by this subpart or by the declaration relating to the retained special declarant rights arising after the transfer.\n\n(4) A transferor who retains no special declarant rights has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor and to whom the special declarant right has not theretofore been assigned.\n\n(c) Rights of purchaser in foreclosure, etc., proceedings.--Unless otherwise provided in the documents creating a security interest, in case of foreclosure of a security interest, tax sale, judicial sale, sale by a trustee under a security agreement or sale under 11 U.S.C. (relating to bankruptcy) or receivership proceedings of any cooperative interests owned by a declarant or real estate in a cooperative subject to development rights, a person acquiring all the cooperative interests or real estate being foreclosed or sold, but only upon his request, succeeds to all special declarant rights related to that property held by that declarant or only to any rights reserved in the declaration pursuant to section 4214 (relating to declarant's office, models and signs) and held by that declarant to maintain models, sales offices and signs. The judgment or instrument conveying title shall provide for transfer of only the special declarant rights requested.\n\n(d) Rights of declarant following foreclosure, etc., proceedings.--Upon foreclosure, tax sale, judicial sale, sale by a trustee under a security agreement or sale under 11 U.S.C. or receivership or similar proceedings of all cooperative interests or real estate in a cooperative owned by a declarant:\n\n(1) the declarant ceases to have any special declarant rights; and\n\n(2) the period of declarant control (section 4303(d)) terminates unless the judgment or instrument conveying title provides for transfer to a successor declarant of all special declarant rights held by the transferor declarant.\n\n(e) Liabilities and obligations of successors.--The liabilities and obligations of a person who succeeds to special declarant rights are as follows:\n\n(1) A successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this subpart or by the declaration.\n\n(2) A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in paragraph (3) or (4), who is not an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed by this subpart or the declaration:\n\n(i) on a declarant which relate to his exercise or nonexercise of special declarant rights; or\n\n(ii) on his transferor, other than:\n\n(A) misrepresentations by any previous declarant, except to the extent knowingly continued or permitted to continue without correcting such misrepresentations;\n\n(B) warranty obligations on improvements made by any previous declarant made before the cooperative was created;\n\n(C) breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or his appointees to the executive board; or\n\n(D) any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or omissions after the transfer.\n\n(3) A successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices and signs (section 4214), if he is not an affiliate of a declarant, may not exercise any other special declarant right and is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant except the obligation to provide a public offering statement and any liability arising as a result thereof.\n\n(4) A successor to all special declarant rights held by his transferor who is not an affiliate of that transferor declarant and who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed or other instrument conveying title to cooperative interests or real estate subject to special declarant rights under subsection (c) may declare his intention in a recorded instrument to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, until transferring all special declarant rights to any person acquiring title to any cooperative interest or real estate subject to development rights owned by the successor or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by his transferor to control the executive board in accordance with the provisions of section 4303(d) (relating to executive board members and officers) for the duration of any period of declarant control, and any attempted exercise of those rights is void. So long as a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant right under this subsection, he is not subject to any liability or obligations as a declarant except liability for his acts and omissions under section 4303(d) and except the obligations set forth in paragraph (3).\n\n(f) Limitation on liability of successor.--Nothing in this section subjects any successor to a special declarant right to any claims against or other obligations of a transferor declarant other than claims and obligations arising under this subpart or the declaration.\n\nCross References.Section 4304 is referred to in section 4402 of this title.",

If more than one of the multiple proprietary lessees are present, the votes allocated to that cooperative interest may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a majority in interest of the multiple proprietary lessees, unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There is majority agreement if any one of the multiple proprietary lessees casts the votes allocated to that cooperative interest without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other proprietary lessees of the cooperative interest.\n\n(b) Proxies.--Votes allocated to a cooperative interest may be cast pursuant to a proxy duly executed by a proprietary lessee. If there is more than one proprietary lessee of a unit, each proprietary lessee of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other proprietary lessees of the unit through a duly executed proxy. A proprietary lessee may not revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section except by actual notice of revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the association. A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice. A proxy terminates one year after its date, unless it specifies a shorter term. The bylaws may provide for requirements and a limit on the class of persons who may hold proxies pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(c) Lessees other than proprietary lessees.--If the declaration requires that votes on specified matters affecting the cooperative be cast by lessees other than proprietary lessees of leased units:\n\n(1) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) apply to lessees as if they were proprietary lessees.\n\n(2) Proprietary lessees who have leased their units to other persons may not cast votes on those specified matters.\n\n(3) Lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records and other rights respecting those matters as if they were proprietary lessees.\n\nProprietary lessees must also be given notice, in the manner provided in section 4308 (relating to meetings), of all meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.

      "text": "(a) Insurance to be carried by association.--Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a cooperative interest to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available:\n\n(1) Property insurance on the common elements and units insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against or, in the case of a conversion building, against fire and extended coverage perils. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies.\n\n(2) Liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements and units.\n\n(3) Any property or comprehensive general liability insurance carried by the association may contain a deductible provision.\n\n(b) Other insurance carried by association.--If the insurance described in subsection (a) is not reasonably available, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by the United States mail to all proprietary lessees. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance in such reasonable amounts and with such reasonable deductibles as the executive board may deem appropriate to protect the association or the proprietary lessees.\n\n(c) Contents of insurance policies.--Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection (a) must provide that:\n\n(1) Each proprietary lessee is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his interest in the common elements or membership in the association.\n\n(2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any proprietary lessee or member of his household.\n\n(3) No act or omission by any proprietary lessee, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy.\n\n(4) If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a proprietary lessee covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.\n\n(d) Proceeds from property insurance.--Any loss covered by the property policy under subsection (a)(1) must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose or otherwise to the association and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a mortgage or deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for the association, proprietary lessees and the lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (g), the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and the association, proprietary lessees and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored or the cooperative is terminated.\n\n(e) Unit owner may obtain insurance.--A proprietary lessee may insure the lessee's unit for all losses to his unit, including losses not covered by the insurance maintained by the association, due to a deductible provision or otherwise. An insurance policy issued to the association shall not prevent a proprietary lessee from obtaining insurance for his own benefit, including insurance to cover any deductibles or losses not covered by the association's property or comprehensive general liability insurance.\n\n(f) Evidence and cancellation of insurance.--An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any proprietary lessee or holder of a security interest. The insurer issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse to renew it until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each proprietary lessee and each holder of a security interest to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses.\n\n(g) Disposition of insurance proceeds.--\n\n(1) Any portion of the cooperative for which insurance is required under this section which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless:\n\n(i) the cooperative is terminated;\n\n(ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or\n\n(iii) 80% of the proprietary lessees, including every proprietary lessee of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.\n\nExcept for the costs of repair or replacement which are not covered due to deductibles, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves which have not been identified by the executive board to fund costs of capital expenditures for the current fiscal year of the association is a common expense.\n\n(2) If the entire cooperative is not repaired or replaced:\n\n(i) the insurance proceeds attributed to the damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the cooperative; and\n\n(ii) except to the extent that other persons will be distributees and except as is otherwise provided in section 4321(i) (relating to limited equity cooperatives):\n\n(A) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements which are not rebuilt must be distributed to the proprietary lessees of those units and the proprietary lessees of the units to which those limited common elements were located or to lienholders, as their interests may appear; and\n\n(B) the remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to all the proprietary lessees or lienholders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common expense liabilities of all the cooperative interests.\n\nIf the proprietary lessees vote not to rebuild any unit, the allocated interests of the cooperative interest of which that unit is a part are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under section 4107(a) (relating to eminent domain), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, section 4217 (relating to termination of cooperative ownership) governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the cooperative is terminated.\n\n(h) Nonresidential cooperative.--The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a cooperative all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use.\n\n(i) Recovery of deductibles.--If an insurance policy maintained by the association contains a deductible, then that portion of any loss or claim which is not covered by insurance due to the application of a deductible, as well as any claim or loss for which the association is self-insured, shall be levied by the executive board in accordance with section 4314(c) (relating to assessments for common expenses).\n\n(Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1499, No.190, eff. 60 days)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 190 amended subsecs.
