By amendment to the declaration, code of regulations and declaration plan, a condominium created pursuant to the Unit Property Act may be made subject to all of the provisions of this subpart in lieu of the provisions of the Unit Property Act, effective as of the date of recordation of such amendments and without in any way terminating the condominium status of the property or in any way affecting any lien or encumbrance on the property, if the terms of such amended documents conform to the requirements of this subpart and if such amendments have been approved by 67% of the persons whose actions would have been required to effect a removal of the property from the Unit Property Act pursuant to section 601 thereof. No amendment of:\n\n(1) the declaration, code of regulations or declaration plan of a condominium created pursuant to the Unit Property Act; or\n\n(2) the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of a condominium created pursuant to this subpart;\n\nmay increase the obligations or responsibilities of a declarant (as such and not as a unit owner) without the joinder of the declarant in such amendment.\n\n(c) Condominiums outside Commonwealth.--This subpart does not apply to condominiums or units located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions (sections 3402 through 3405) apply to all dispositions thereof in this Commonwealth unless exempt under section 3401(b)(5) (relating to applicability; waiver).\n\n(Dec. 18, 1992, P.L.1279, No.168, eff. 45 days; Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1509, No.191, eff. 60 days; July 4, 2008, P.L.619, No.49, eff. imd.)\n\n2008 Amendment.Act 49 amended subsec.
