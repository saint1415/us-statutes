(a) General rule.-- Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the appointment of an individual entering the classified service or promoted in the classified service shall be from an eligible list established as the result of examinations given by the Office of Administration to determine the relative merit of candidates. Examinations may be written and shall be competitive and open to each individual who may be lawfully appointed to the position within the class for which the examinations are held. An individual in an unskilled position shall enter the classified service by promotion without examination in accordance with the following: (1) The individual shall enter the classified service if: (i) The promotion is into a classified position immediately above the individual's own position. (ii) The promotion is based on seniority and meritorious service. (iii) The individual meets the minimum requirements for that position. (iv) The individual satisfactorily completes a six-month probationary period in the classified position.

      "text": "§ 4217. Termination of cooperative ownership. (a) Number of votes required.-- Except: (1) in the case of the taking of all of the units by eminent domain (section 4107); (2) in the case of foreclosure of a security interest against the entire cooperative which has priority over the declaration or which is subordinate to a declaration that expressly provides that the holder of the security interest has the right to terminate the cooperative when the foreclosure of the security interest has been consummated; or (3) in the case of the expiration or termination of a lease which has priority over the declaration (unless a contrary intent is expressly stated in the lease); cooperative ownership may be terminated only at a meeting of the association and by the vote, in person or by proxy, of proprietary lessees of cooperative interests to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the cooperative are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (b) Execution and recording of termination agreement.-- An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of proprietary lessees. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a proprietary lessee. If, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real estate in the cooperative is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the terms of the sale. The termination agreement will become null and void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of: (1) The expiration of the year from the date and all ratifications thereof it was first executed and ratified by a proprietary lessee. (2) Such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the cooperative is situated in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and indexed in the name of the cooperative and the association in both the grantor index and the grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recordation. (c) Status if real estate sold.-- The association, on behalf of the proprietary lessees, may contract for the sale of real estate in the cooperative, but the contract is not binding until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Except to the extent that any provisions in the declaration limit the amount that may be received by a proprietary lessee upon termination (section 4205(a)(10)), proceeds of the sale must be distributed to holders of liens against the association, against the cooperative interests and to proprietary lessees, all as their interests may appear, in accordance with subsections (d) and (e) with proprietary lessees being entitled to receive the entire balance of the association's assets, after payment of all such lienholders, pursuant to subsection (e), except that, in the case of a limited equity cooperative with a declaration of the type described in section 4321(e) (relating to limited equity cooperatives), the provisions of that section shall govern. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each proprietary lessee and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of that occupancy, each proprietary lessee and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on proprietary lessees by this subpart or the declaration. (d) Priority of liens.-- Following termination of the cooperative, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for proprietary lessees and holders of liens against the association and the cooperative interests as their interests may appear. The declaration may provide that all creditors of the association have priority over any interests of proprietary lessees and creditors of proprietary lessees. In that event, following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative which were perfected before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lienholder, and any other creditor of the association is to be treated as if he had perfected a lien against the cooperative immediately before termination. Unless the declaration provides that all creditors of the association have that priority: (1) The lien of each creditor of the association which was perfected against the association before termination becomes, upon termination, a lien against each cooperative interest as of the date the lien was perfected. (2) Any other creditor of the association is to be treated upon termination as if he had perfected a lien against the cooperative interests immediately before termination. (3) The amount of the lien of an association's creditor described in paragraphs (1) and (2) against each of the cooperative interests must be proportionate to the ratio which that cooperative interest's common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all of the cooperative interests. (4) The one lien, unless the declaration designates a greater number, against each proprietary lessee which was perfected prior to any other liens against the proprietary lessee and before termination continues as a lien against the proprietary lessee's cooperative interest as of the date the lien was perfected. (5) Any other creditor of a proprietary lessee is to be treated upon termination as if he had perfected a lien against that proprietary lessee immediately before termination. (6) The assets of the association shall be distributed to all proprietary lessees and all lienholders against their cooperative interests as their interests may appear in the order described in paragraphs (1) through (5), and creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any proprietary lessee in excess of the amount of the creditor's lien against that proprietary lessee's cooperative interest. Regardless of the priority given to creditors of the association, no proprietary lessee shall have any personal liability to a creditor of the association beyond such proprietary lessee's cooperative interest. (e) Valuation of proprietary lessee's interest.-- The declaration may provide that the respective interests of proprietary lessees referred to in subsections (c) and (d) are the fair market values of the cooperative interests as of a date no earlier than six months prior to the termination as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the proprietary lessees at least 30 days prior to a meeting of the association at which meeting the appraisal will be deemed approved unless it is rejected by vote, in person or by proxy, of proprietary lessees holding more than 50% of the votes in the association. If the declaration provides for such an appraisal procedure, the proportion of any proprietary lessee's interest to that of all proprietary lessees is determined by dividing the fair market value of that proprietary lessee's cooperative interest by the total fair market values of all the cooperative interests. If the declaration does not provide for such an appraisal procedure or if the appraisal is rejected by the requisite number of votes in the association, the interests of all proprietary lessees are their respective ownership interests in the association immediately before the termination.

(a) General rule.-- This subpart applies to all cooperatives created within this Commonwealth after the effective date of this subpart, but, if such a cooperative contains only units restricted to nonresidential use, it is subject only to sections 4106 (relating to applicability of local ordinances, regulations and building codes) and 4107 (relating to eminent domain) unless the declaration provides that the entire subpart is applicable. (b) Existing cooperatives.-- Except as provided in subsection (c), sections 4106, 4107, 4203 (relating to construction and validity of declaration and bylaws), 4219 (relating to master associations), 4220 (relating to merger or consolidation of cooperatives), 4302(a)(1) through (6) and (11) through (17) (relating to powers of association), 4311 (relating to tort and contract liability), 4315 (relating to lien for assessments), 4317 (relating to association records), 4319 (relating to termination of cooperative interest), 4409 (relating to resales of cooperative interests) and 4415 (relating to effect of violations on rights of action), and section 4103 (relating to definitions) to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subpart and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. By compliance with the requirements of section 4201 (relating to creation of cooperative ownership), a cooperative created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart may be made subject to all of the provisions of this subpart, effective as of the date of recordation of the document or documents specified in section 4201, without in any way terminating the cooperative status of the property or in any way affecting any lien or encumbrance on the property, if the terms of such document or documents have been approved by all the persons whose actions would have been required to effect the termination of the cooperative pursuant to its governing documents in effect at the time such approval is given, provided, however, that such action shall not increase the obligations or responsibilities of a declarant, as such and not as a proprietary lessee, without the joinder of the declarant in the document or documents required by section 4201. (b.1) Retroactivity.-- (1) Sections 4103, 4108 (relating to supplemental general principles of law applicable), 4112 (relating to obligation of good faith), 4216 (relating to amendment of declaration), 4217(g) (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), 4302(a)(8)(i) and (9), 4303(a), (b) and (c) (relating to executive board members and officers), 4307 (relating to upkeep of cooperative), 4314 (relating to assessments for common expenses) and 4316 (relating to other liens affecting cooperative), to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. (2) Section 4303(d), to the extent necessary in construing that subsection, applies to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but the subsection applies only with respect to events and circumstances occurring 180 days after the effective date of this subsection and does not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those cooperatives. (c) Units restricted to nonresidential use.-- If a cooperative created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains only units restricted to nonresidential use, it is subject only to sections 4106 and 4107 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that cooperative from the date such amended declaration is recorded as required for a declaration under section 4201. (d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart. (2) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made pursuant to this subpart. An amendment to the declaration or bylaws authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the declaration and bylaws being amended. If any such amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this subpart, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in this subpart also apply to that person. (e) Cooperative interests outside Commonwealth.-- This subpart does not apply to cooperative interests located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions (sections 4401 through 4408) apply to all cooperative interests offered within this Commonwealth for which either the contract for disposition is executed by any party within this Commonwealth or the disposition is effectuated within this Commonwealth unless exempt under section 4401(b) (relating to applicability; waiver). (f) Liens and security interests.-- The enactment of this subpart shall not affect any lien upon a cooperative or any lien upon or security interest in any property of the association or in any cooperative interest if such lien or security interest shall have been perfected prior to the effective date of this subpart.

      "heading": "Condominiums containing conversion buildings.",
      "text": "§ 3410. Condominiums containing conversion buildings. (a) Notice of conversion.-- The declarant of every condominium containing one or more conversion buildings shall give each of the residential tenants and residential subtenants, if any, lawfully in possession of a unit or units in a conversion building or buildings, a conversion notice no later than one year before the declarant will require such residential tenant and residential subtenant to vacate. The conversion notice must set forth generally the rights of residential tenants and residential subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States certified or registered mail return receipt requested to the residential tenant and residential subtenant at the address of the unit and not more than one other mailing address provided by a residential tenant. Every notice shall be accompanied by a public offering statement concerning the proposed sale of condominium units within such building or buildings. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), no residential tenant or residential subtenant in a conversion building may be required by the declarant to vacate the unit he leases earlier than one year after the conversion notice date, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises and the terms of the tenancy, including those terms that apply to a period occurring in whole or in part after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during that period. Failure of a declarant to give notice to a residential tenant or residential subtenant entitled to such notice pursuant to this subsection is a defense to an action for possession against such residential tenant or residential subtenant. (b) Offer to tenant to purchase unit.-- For six months after the conversion notice date, the declarant shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use in a conversion building to the tenant who leases that unit. If the tenant fails to purchase his unit during that six-month period, the declarant may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following six months at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection shall not apply to any rental unit which immediately prior to the conversion notice date was restricted or devoted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of which unit, after the creation of the condominium, will not substantially conform to the boundaries of such unit on the conversion notice date. (c) Effect of wrongful conveyance.-- If a declarant, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, recordation of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that unit if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection (b) but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of subsection (b). (d) Notice to vacate.-- If a conversion notice specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, the conversion notice also constitutes a notice of termination of the tenant's lease, subject to revocation in accordance with subsection (i), and a notice to quit specified by section 501 of the act of April 6, 1951 (P.L.69, No.20), known as The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951. (e) Improper lease termination prohibited.-- (1) Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms. (2) Nothing in this section or in any lease shall prohibit a residential tenant, after receiving notice pursuant to subsection (a), from terminating any lease without any liability for such termination provided such tenant gives the building owner 90 days' written notice of the intent to terminate the lease. (3) The declarant or owner of any proposed conversion condominium shall not engage in any activity of any nature which would coerce the tenant into terminating any lease, including but not limited to stampeding, harassing tenants or withholding normal services or repairs. (f) Units leased to senior citizens and disabled persons.-- (1) For the purpose of this subsection, an eligible tenant or subtenant shall be a natural person who, on the conversion notice date, lawfully occupies a unit in a conversion building as his principal residence and is 62 years of age or older or is disabled, and has occupied the unit for at least two years. For the purpose of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to be \"disabled\" if on the conversion notice date he is totally and permanently unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impediment, including, but not limited to, blindness. (2) Within 60 days after the conversion notice date, any tenant, or subtenant, in possession of a unit, who believes that he is an eligible tenant or subtenant shall so notify the declarant and shall provide the declarant with proof of his eligibility. Any eligible tenant or subtenant who has established his eligibility as aforesaid shall be entitled to remain in possession of his unit for two years following the conversion notice date, notwithstanding any prior termination date in his lease, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other occupants' peaceful enjoyment of the condominium, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a time period after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during the time period between the original lease termination date and the expiration of this two-year period except as is otherwise provided in paragraph (3). (3) The monthly rental payable by the tenant during the time period commencing upon the later to occur of the original lease termination date or the first anniversary of the conversion notice date and ending upon the expiration of the two-year period described in paragraph (2) shall be the same monthly rental as was payable for the month immediately preceding the original lease termination date, except that, at the landlord's option, such monthly rental may be increased by the lesser of 5% of such monthly rental or the same percentage increase as the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor for the six-month time period commencing on the first day of the first full calendar month after the conversion notice date. (4) Failure of a declarant to comply with the provisions of this subsection is a defense to an action for possession. (g) Tenant meetings; open to the public.-- With respect to any conversion building containing one or more units then occupied for residential use, at least 30 days before the conversion notice date, the declarant shall hold a tenant meeting open to the public in the municipality where the proposed conversion building is located at a place and time convenient to the persons who may be directly affected by the conversion. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given to residential tenants and subtenants in lawful possession of their units in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice and to the general public by a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the condominium is located, except that no notice to the general public need be given with respect to conversion buildings as to which the provisions of section 3402(b) (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) are applicable. At such meeting, representatives of the declarant shall briefly describe the following and may, but shall not be required to, discuss other matters: (1) The rights and obligations of tenants and subtenants pursuant to this section. (2) Improvements, if any, then planned to be made to the condominium by the declarant. (3) The anticipated approximate range of initial unit sales prices. Specific unit sales prices need not, however, be provided. (4) The anticipated approximate range of estimated monthly common expenses for various types of units, however, specific per unit estimates need not be provided. (h) Community development grants.-- If Federal funds under Title I of the Community Development Act of 1974 have been used to finance the rehabilitation of multifamily rental housing, with the intent that such housing subsequent to the rehabilitation is to be used for residential rental purposes, such housing shall not be converted to a condominium for a period of ten years from the date the rehabilitation is completed. (i) Revocation.-- A declarant may subsequently revoke a conversion notice if the declarant has expressly reserved the right of revocation in the conversion notice and if the notice of revocation: (1) is given prior to the conveyance of any unit in the condominium occurring after the conversion notice date other than a unit or units conveyed to a successor declarant or as a result of foreclosure of a mortgage on the unit or a deed in lieu thereof; (2) is given in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice; and (3) is given to all persons who were entitled to receive the conversion notice and who continue to be in lawful occupancy at the time such notice of revocation is given. The giving of a notice of revocation revokes all rights granted under this section, but does not revoke the rights granted to residential tenants under subsection (a) or (f), and such rights shall be deemed to have been incorporated in each residential tenant's lease. (j) Waiver of purchase rights.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this subpart prohibiting waiver of rights, any tenant may waive his right to purchase a unit pursuant to subsection (b) if the waiver is in writing, is acknowledged and is given in consideration of: (1) an extension of the term of the tenant's tenancy and right of occupancy under this subpart beyond the time period required by subsection (a) or (f) as applicable; (2) the tenant entering into an agreement to purchase another unit in the condominium; or (3) all occupants of the unit making alternative living arrangements. (k) Alteration of terms of tenancy.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (a) or (f), the terms of the tenancy of a tenant or subtenant may be altered with the express written consent of that tenant or subtenant, and such altered terms shall then be the terms of tenancy referred to in this section. (l) Application of section.-- The provisions of this section shall apply only with respect to conversion buildings in which one or more residential tenants or residential subtenants are in lawful occupancy on the conversion notice date and the only tenants who are entitled to exercise the rights granted under this section are residential tenants or residential subtenants: (1) who are in lawful occupancy of conversion building on the date the declarant gives the conversion notice; or (2) who commence their tenancy after the notice of conversion is given to the other residential tenants without having been notified in writing, at or prior to the commencement of their tenancy, that the property is then a condominium and that they are not entitled to the rights granted under this section. Such rights continue only so long as the lawful occupancy of the tenant or subtenant continues.

Such substantial completion shall be evidenced by a recorded certification of completion executed by an independent registered surveyor, architect or professional engineer with regard to any such structure.

      "heading": "Termination of condominium.",
      "text": "§ 3220. Termination of condominium. (a) Number of votes required.-- Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain (section 3107), a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (b) Execution and recording agreement and ratifications.-- An agreement of unit owners to terminate a condominium must be evidenced by their execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners who are owners of record as of the date preceding the date of recordation of the termination agreement. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. The termination agreement will become null and void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of: (1) The expiration of one year from the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. (2) Such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. If, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the terms of the sale. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the condominium in both the grantor index and the grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recordation. (c) Status if real estate sold.-- The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). If the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (f). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this subpart or the declaration. (d) Status if real estate not sold.-- If the real estate constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to the real estate, upon termination, vests in the unit owners as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (f) and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. (e) Distribution of assets of association.-- Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, shall be held by the association as trustee or unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units which were recorded, filed of public record or otherwise perfected before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination. (f) Respective interests of unit owners.-- The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (c), (d) and (e) are as follows: (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements and common element interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements. (2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof prior to destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination. (g) Effect of foreclosure or enforcement of lien.-- Except as provided in subsection (h), foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the condominium. (h) Exclusion from condominium upon foreclosure.-- If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over the declaration and if the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium. (i) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.-- In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the condominium other than a provision providing for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the condominium would otherwise be terminated owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the condominium are allocated vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.

No other property of a unit owner is subject to the claims of creditors of the association. (b) If security interest in common elements.-- If the association has granted a security interest in the common elements to a creditor of the association pursuant to section 3318 (relating to conveyance or encumbrance of common elements), the holder of that security interest shall exercise its right against the common elements before its judgment lien on any unit may be enforced. (c) Release upon payment of unit owner's share.-- Whether perfected before or after the creation of the condominium, if a lien other than a deed of trust or mortgage, including a judgment lien or lien attributable to work performed or materials supplied before creation of the condominium, becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the amount of the lien attributable to his unit, and the lienholder, upon receipt of payment, promptly shall deliver a release of the lien covering that unit. The amount of the payment must be proportionate to the ratio which that unit owner's common expense liability bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the lien. After payment, the association may not assess or have a lien against that unit owner's unit for any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with that lien. (d) Indexing of judgments.-- A judgment against the association must be indexed in the name of the condominium and the association and, when so indexed, is notice of the lien against the units.

(a) General rule.-- Except as is otherwise expressly provided in this section, limited equity cooperatives shall be created and operated pursuant to the other provisions of this act. (b) Property classification.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4105 (relating to property classification of cooperative interests), unless the declaration filed for the creation of a limited equity cooperative expressly provides otherwise, the cooperative interests shall be personal property for all purposes. (c) Alternation of units.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4210 (relating to alteration of units), if the association is responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement of the units as well as the common elements and limited common elements, as provided in subsection (g), a proprietary lessee may make improvements or alterations to his unit only with the prior permission of the association, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law. (d) Distribution to proprietary lessees upon termination of limited equity cooperatives.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4217 (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), distributions to proprietary lessees in limited equity cooperatives shall be no greater than the amount for which their respective cooperative interests could be transferred as restricted by the declaration and bylaws of the association. (e) Distribution of residual proceeds upon termination of limited equity cooperatives.-- If the declaration of a limited equity cooperative states that it is the declarant's intent that some or all units in the cooperative shall be affordable by low-income and moderate-income persons throughout the existence of the cooperative, then any assets of the association remaining after the distributions to lienholders and proprietary lessees as provided above and in the last sentence of section 4217(e) shall be distributed by the executive board to a public or private entity to be used in a manner consistent with the declarant's intent for the creation of additional housing affordable by low-income and moderate-income persons. If the balance of the funds is not so disbursed, the court of common pleas of the county in which the property is located is hereby authorized to distribute the funds as provided in this section.

(h) Subjecting a limited equity cooperative to a security interest.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4312(a) (relating to conveyance or encumbrance of cooperative) all or part of a limited equity cooperative may be subjected to a security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at least 51% of the votes in the association, including 51% of the votes allocated to cooperative interests not owned by a declarant or any larger percentage the declaration specifies agree to that action. If fewer than all the units or limited common elements in a limited equity cooperative are to be subjected to a security interest, then all of the proprietary lessees of those units or the units to which those limited common elements are allocated must consent in order to subject them to a security interest, except that the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall govern unless the declaration provides, pursuant to subsection (g), that expenses related to the limited common elements shall be common expenses. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (i) Disposition of insurance proceeds.-- The disposition of insurance proceeds due proprietary lessees in limited equity cooperatives under section 4313(g)(2)(ii) (relating to insurance) shall be limited to the amount for which the proprietary lessee's cooperative interest may be sold pursuant to the controlling provisions of the declaration and the bylaws of the association.

(a) Scope.-- Nothing in this section shall be construed to make the declarant responsible for any items of maintenance relating to the units or common elements. (b) General rule.-- (1) A declarant warrants against structural defects in structures constructed, modified, altered or improved by or on behalf of such declarant in: (i) each of the units and the controlled facilities that are part of a unit for two years from the date each unit is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; and (ii) all of the controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and all common facilities for two years except facilities which have been dedicated to a municipality, municipal authority or other governmental unit. (2) Only the association may bring an action for breach of warranty with respect to common facilities and the controlled facilities that are not part of a unit. An action for breach of warranty with respect to one or more units or controlled facilities that are a part of a unit may be brought either by the association or an owner of an affected unit. Any conveyance of a unit during the two-year warranty period shall be deemed to transfer to the purchaser all of the declarant's warranties created under this section. The two years shall begin, as to each of the controlled facilities that are not part of a unit, whenever the controlled facilities that are not part of the unit have been completed and, as to each common facility, whenever such common facilities have been completed or, if later: (i) As to any controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and as to common facilities within any additional real estate or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (ii) As to any controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and as to common facilities within any convertible real estate or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (iii) As to any controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and as to common facilities within any other portion of the planned community, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (c) Planned communities containing conversion buildings.-- A declarant of a planned community containing one or more conversion building warrants as follows: (1) That there are no structural defects in components installed anywhere in the planned community or in work done or improvements made by or on behalf of the declarant anywhere in the planned community. (2) That all units and common elements in each conversion building have been inspected for visible structural and mechanical defects and for other visible conditions that adversely affect the health or safety of residential occupants, as required by section 5404(a)(1) (relating to public offering statement; planned communities containing conversion buildings), except no such inspection is required of any unit if the tenant or other lawful occupant of the unit does not permit such inspection to be conducted. (3) That any defects and other visible conditions found have been repaired. The warranties under subsection (b) shall be applicable to any units and common elements that are located within a building that contains or comprises one or more units and is not a conversion building. Otherwise, the declarant may offer the units, common elements or both in an \"as is\" condition. The declarant of a planned community containing any conversion buildings may also give a more extensive warranty in writing. The times at which the warranties required by this subsection commence and the duration of such warranties shall be as provided in subsection (b). (d) Exclusion or modification of warranty.-- Except with respect to a purchaser of a unit for residential use, the warranty against structural defects: (1) May be excluded or modified by agreement of the parties. (2) Is excluded by expression of disclaimer, such as \"as is,\" \"with all faults\" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties. (e) Limitation of actions.-- No action to enforce the warranty created by this section shall be commenced later than six years after the warranty begins, provided, however, that the limitation period affecting a right of action by the association under this section shall be six years after the warranty begins or two years after the unit owners elect an executive board under section 5303(e) (relating to executive board members and officers), whichever is later. (f) Disclaimer of implied warranties.-- To the extent permitted by applicable law, a declarant may disclaim implied warranties applicable to any unit or common elements to which the warranty provided by this section applies, provided such disclaimer is set forth in the contract for the sale of a unit and in the public offering statement for the planned community of which the unit or common element is a part.

      "heading": "Cooperatives containing conversion buildings.",
      "text": "§ 4412. Cooperatives containing conversion buildings. (a) Notice of conversion.-- The declarant of every cooperative containing one or more conversion buildings shall give each of the residential tenants and subtenants, if any, lawfully in possession of a unit or units in a conversion building a conversion notice no later than one year before the declarant will require residential tenants and residential subtenants to vacate, subject to revocation of such notice in accordance with subsection (k). The conversion notice must set forth generally the rights of residential tenants and residential subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the residential tenant and residential subtenant at the address of the unit and not more than one other mailing address provided by a residential tenant. Every notice shall be accompanied by a public offering statement concerning the proposed sale of cooperative interests within such conversion building or buildings. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), no such residential tenant or residential subtenant in a conversion building may be required to vacate the unit he leases earlier than one year after the conversion notice date, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a period occurring in whole or in part after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during that period. Failure to give notice to a residential tenant or residential subtenant entitled to such notice pursuant to this subsection is a defense to an action for possession against such residential tenant or residential subtenant. (b) Offer to tenant to purchase cooperative interest.-- For six months after the conversion notice date, the declarant shall offer to convey the cooperative interest for each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use in a conversion building to the tenant who leases that unit. If the tenant fails to purchase the cooperative interest during that six-month period, the offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in that cooperative interest during the following six months at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection shall not apply to any cooperative interest in a conversion building if the unit which is part of that cooperative interest was, immediately prior to the conversion notice date, restricted or devoted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of which unit, after the creation of the cooperative, will not substantially conform to the boundaries of such unit on the conversion notice date. (c) Effect of wrongful conveyance.-- If a declarant, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a cooperative interest to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, that conveyance extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that cooperative interest if the deed states that the declarant has complied with subsection (b), but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of subsection (b). (d) Notice to vacate.-- If a conversion notice specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, the conversion notice also constitutes a notice of termination of the tenant's lease, subject to revocation in accordance with subsection (k) and a notice to quit specified by section 501 of the act of April 6, 1951 (P.L.69, No.20), known as The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951. (e) Improper lease termination prohibited.-- (1) Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease in violation of its terms. (2) Nothing in this section or in any lease shall prohibit a residential tenant, after receiving notice pursuant to subsection (a), from terminating any lease without any liability for such termination provided such tenant gives the building owner at least 90 days' written notice of the intent to terminate the lease. (3) The declarant and, if different, the owner shall not engage in any activity of any nature which would coerce any residential tenant of a conversion building into terminating any lease, including, but not limited to, stampeding, harassing tenants or withholding normal services or repairs. (f) Units leased to senior citizens and blind and disabled persons.-- (1) For the purpose of this subsection, an eligible tenant or subtenant shall be a natural person who, on the conversion notice date, lawfully occupies the unit as his principal residence and is 62 years of age or older or is disabled. For the purpose of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to be \"disabled\" if, on the conversion notice date, he is totally and permanently unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impediment, including, but not limited to, blindness. (2) Within 60 days after the conversion notice date, any tenant or subtenant in possession of a unit who believes that he is an eligible tenant or subtenant shall so notify the declarant and shall provide the declarant with proof of his eligibility. Any eligible tenant or subtenant who has established his eligibility shall be entitled to remain in possession of his unit for two years following the conversion notice date, notwithstanding any prior termination date in his lease, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other occupants' peaceful enjoyment of the cooperative, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a time period after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during the time period between the original lease termination date and the expiration of this two-year period, except as is provided in paragraph (3). (3) The monthly rental payable by the tenant during the time period between the later to occur of the original lease termination date or the first anniversary of the conversion notice date and the expiration of the two-year period described in paragraph (2) sentence shall be the same monthly rental as was payable for the month immediately preceding the original lease termination date, except that, at the landlord's option, such monthly rental may be increased by the lesser of 5% of such monthly rental or the same percentage increase as the percentage increase, if any, in the cost of living in the United States during the six-month time period commencing on the first day of the first full calendar month after the conversion notice date. (4) Failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection is a defense to an action for possession. (g) Tenant meetings.-- With respect to any cooperative containing a conversion building with one or more units then occupied for residential use, at least 30 days before the conversion notice date, the declarant shall hold a tenant meeting open to the public in the municipality where the conversion is proposed at a place and time convenient to the persons who may be directly affected by the conversion. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given to tenants and subtenants in lawful possession of their units in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice and to the general public by a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the cooperative is located, except that no notice to the general public need be given with respect to conversion buildings in cooperatives as to which the provisions of section 4401(b) (relating to applicability; waiver) are applicable. At such meeting, representatives of the declarant shall briefly describe the following and may, but shall not be required to, discuss other matters: (1) The rights and obligations of tenants and subtenants pursuant to this section. (2) Improvements, if any, then planned to be made to the cooperative. (3) The anticipated approximate range of initial cooperative interest sales prices, but specific sales prices need not be provided. (4) The anticipated approximate range of estimated monthly common expense liabilities for various types of cooperative interests but specific per cooperative interest estimates need not be provided. (h) Waiver of right to purchase.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this subpart prohibiting waiver of rights, any tenant or subtenant may waive his right to purchase a cooperative interest pursuant to subsection (b) if the waiver is in writing, is acknowledged and is given in consideration of: (1) a written extension of the term of that tenant's tenancy and right of occupancy under this subpart beyond the time period required by subsection (a) or (f) as applicable; (2) the tenant entering into an agreement to purchase another cooperative interest in the cooperative; or (3) the tenant or subtenant making alternative living arrangements. (i) Alteration of term of tenancy.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (a) or (f), the terms of the tenancy of a tenant or subtenant may be altered with the express written consent of that tenant or subtenant, and such altered terms shall then be the terms of tenancy referred to in this section. (j) Limitation to tenants in occupancy.-- The provisions of this section shall apply only with respect to conversion buildings in which one or more residential tenants or residential subtenants is in lawful occupancy on the conversion notice date, and the only tenants who are entitled to exercise the rights granted under this section are residential tenants or residential subtenants: (1) who are in lawful occupancy of a conversion building on the conversion notice date; or (2) who commence their tenancy after the conversion notice date without having been notified in writing at or prior to the commencement of their tenancy that the property is then a cooperative and that they are not entitled to the rights granted under this section. Such rights continue only so long as the lawful occupancy of the tenant or subtenant continues. (k) Revocation of conversion notice.-- A declarant may subsequently revoke a conversion notice if the declarant has expressly reserved the right of revocation in the conversion notice and if the notice of revocation: (1) is given prior to the conveyance of any unit in the cooperative occurring after the conversion notice date other than a cooperative interest or cooperative interests conveyed to a successor declarant or as a result of a foreclosure of a mortgage on a cooperative interest or a deed in lieu thereof; (2) is given in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice; and (3) is given to all persons who were entitled to receive the conversion notice and who continue to be in lawful occupancy at the time such notice of revocation is given. The giving of a notice of revocation revokes all rights granted under this section, but does not revoke the rights granted to residential tenants under subsection (a) or (f), and such rights shall be deemed to have been incorporated in each residential tenant's lease.

(2) Any model or description of the physical characteristics of the cooperative, including plans and specifications of or for improvements, if incorporated by reference in a public offering statement or other written statement or document signed by the seller and relied upon by the buyer in accordance with this subsection creates an express warranty that the cooperative will conform substantially to the model or description. (3) Any description of the quantity or extent of the real estate comprising the cooperative if incorporated by reference in a public offering statement or other written statement or document signed by the seller and relied upon by the buyer in accordance with this subsection, including, but not limited to, plats or surveys, creates an express warranty that the cooperative will conform to the description, subject to customary tolerances. (4) A provision that a buyer of a cooperative interest may put a unit which is part of that cooperative interest only to a specified use is an express warranty that the specified use is lawful. (b) Formal words unnecessary.-- Neither formal words, such as \"warranty\" or \"guarantee,\" nor a specific intention to make a warranty are necessary to create an express warranty of quality, but a statement purporting to be merely an opinion or commendation of the real estate or its value does not create a warranty. (c) Transfer of warranty.-- Any conveyance of a cooperative interest transfers to the purchaser all express warranties of quality made by previous sellers.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to make the warrantor responsible for any items of maintenance relating to the units or common elements. (b) General rule.-- A declarant warrants against structural defects in each of the units for two years from the date each is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser and all of the common elements for two years. Any conveyance of a cooperative interest during the two-year warranty period shall be deemed to transfer to the purchaser all of the warranties created under this section. The two years shall begin as to each of the common elements whenever the common element has been completed or, if later: (1) as to any common element in real estate that may be added to the cooperative, at the time the first cooperative interest for a unit in such real estate is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; (2) as to any common element for which a development right to convert such common element to units or limited common elements has been reserved, at the time the first cooperative interest for a converted unit out of such common element is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; and (3) as to any common element within any other portion of the cooperative, at the time the first cooperative interest in the cooperative is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (c) Scope and applicability of warranties.-- A declarant of a cooperative containing one or more conversion buildings warrants: (1) against structural defects in components installed in each of the conversion buildings by the declarant or in work done or improvements made by the declarant in each of the conversion buildings; (2) that all units and common elements in each conversion building have been inspected for visible structural and mechanical defects and for other visible conditions that adversely affect the health or safety of residential occupants as required by section 4406(a)(1)(i) (relating to public offering statement; cooperatives containing conversion buildings), except that no such inspection is required of any unit the tenant or other lawful occupant of which does not permit such inspection to be conducted; and (3) that any such defects and other visible conditions found have been repaired.

(a) General rule.-- Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: (1) Green indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn except that vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited. (ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113 (relating to pedestrian-control signals), pedestrians facing any green signal may proceed across the roadway within a crosswalk. (2) Steady yellow indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green indication is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113, pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. (3) Steady red indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, or if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subparagraph (ii). (ii) Unless signing is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way highway onto a one-way highway after stopping as required by subparagraph (i). Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. (b) Places other than intersections.-- In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. (c) Inoperable or malfunctioning signal.-- If a traffic-control signal is out of operation or is not functioning properly, including, but not limited to, a signal that uses inductive loop sensors or other automated technology to detect the presence of vehicles that fails to detect a vehicle, vehicular traffic facing a: (1) Green or yellow signal may proceed with caution as indicated in subsection (a)(1) and (2). (2) Red or completely unlighted signal shall stop in the same manner as at a stop sign, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign as provided in section 3323 (relating to stop signs and yield signs).

(2) Phrase \"Don't Walk\" or upraised hand symbol.-- Pedestrians should not start to cross the roadway in the direction of the signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing on the \"Walk\" signal should proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while the \"Don't Walk\" signal is showing.

(a) Number of votes required.-- Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain (section 3107), a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (b) Execution and recording agreement and ratifications.-- An agreement of unit owners to terminate a condominium must be evidenced by their execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners who are owners of record as of the date preceding the date of recordation of the termination agreement. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. The termination agreement will become null and void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of: (1) The expiration of one year from the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. (2) Such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. If, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the terms of the sale. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the condominium in both the grantor index and the grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recordation. (c) Status if real estate sold.-- The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). If the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (f). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this subpart or the declaration. (d) Status if real estate not sold.-- If the real estate constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to the real estate, upon termination, vests in the unit owners as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (f) and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. (e) Distribution of assets of association.-- Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, shall be held by the association as trustee or unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units which were recorded, filed of public record or otherwise perfected before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination. (f) Respective interests of unit owners.-- The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (c), (d) and (e) are as follows: (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements and common element interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements. (2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof prior to destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination. (g) Effect of foreclosure or enforcement of lien.-- Except as provided in subsection (h), foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the condominium. (h) Exclusion from condominium upon foreclosure.-- If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over the declaration and if the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium. (i) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.-- In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the condominium other than a provision providing for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the condominium would otherwise be terminated owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the condominium are allocated vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.

(a) Applicability of section.-- If the declaration for a condominium provides that any of the powers described in section 3302 (relating to powers of unit owners' association) with respect to the condominium are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association (a \"master association\") which exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more other condominiums or other incorporated or unincorporated associations, then, except as modified by this section, all provisions of this subpart applicable to unit owners' associations shall apply to any such master association insofar as its actions affect the condominium. (b) Powers.-- Unless a master association is acting in the capacity of an association described in section 3301 (relating to organization of unit owners' association) with respect to a condominium which is part of the master association, it may exercise with respect to the condominium only such powers set forth in section 3302 and only to the extent expressly permitted in the declaration of condominium which provides for the delegation of powers from its condominium association to the master association and accepted by such master association as indicated in the provisions of the declaration or other organizational documents of such master association. (c) Liability of executive board members and officers.-- If the declaration of a condominium provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board have no liability for the acts or omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following such delegation. The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the condominium association whose powers are delegated thereto and the unit owners of such condominium on the same basis as officers and executive board members of such condominium immediately before such delegation of powers. (d) Rights and responsibilities of persons electing governing body.-- The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in sections 3303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 3308 (relating to meetings), 3309 (relating to quorums), 3310 (relating to voting; proxies) and 3320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association with respect to the exercise of powers delegated pursuant to a condominium declaration to such master association, but apply only to those persons who elect the governing body of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this subpart. (e) Election of master association governing body.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3303(e) with respect to the election of the executive board by all unit owners after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 3301, the instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each condominium or the organizational documents of other associations the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association shall provide that the governing body of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways: (1) All unit owners of all condominiums and other properties subject to the master association elect all members of the governing body of the master association. (2) All members of the governing bodies of the condominium associations and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect all members of the master association governing body. (3) All unit owners of each condominium and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (4) All members of the governing bodies of the condominiums and other property associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (f) Delegation of responsibility and authority.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to a condominium if and when: (1) there occurs either a date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the condominium; (2) there occurs an event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable, and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that: (i) such event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the condominium; and (ii) that a copy of such instrument has been sent to all unit owners; or (3) the declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the condominium and that a copy of such instrument has been sent to the executive board and all unit owners. Paragraph (3) shall be applicable only if the declarant shall have expressly reserved in the declaration, pursuant to section 3205(12) (relating to contents of declaration; all condominiums), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the condominium and only if the instrument exercising such right shall have been recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right.

The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association. (b) Required agreement.-- An agreement to convey common elements or subject them to a security interest must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date. The agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is situated and is effective only upon recordation. (c) Association powers.-- The association on behalf of the unit owners may contract to convey common elements or subject them to a security interest, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance, including the power to execute deeds or other instruments.

(c) Release upon payment of unit owner's share.-- Whether perfected before or after the creation of the condominium, if a lien other than a deed of trust or mortgage, including a judgment lien or lien attributable to work performed or materials supplied before creation of the condominium, becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the amount of the lien attributable to his unit, and the lienholder, upon receipt of payment, promptly shall deliver a release of the lien covering that unit.

(ii) Any investigation conducted to determine the presence of hazardous conditions on or affecting the condominium site. (iii) Any finding or action recommended to be taken in the report of any such investigation or by any governmental body, agency or authority in order to correct any hazardous conditions, and any action taken pursuant to those recommendations. If the declarant has no knowledge of such matters, the declarant shall make a statement to that effect. Declarant shall also set forth the address and phone number of the regional offices of the Department of Environmental Resources and the United States Environmental Protection Agency where information concerning environmental conditions affecting the condominium site may be obtained. (b) Exceptions.-- If a condominium composed of not more than 12 units is not a flexible condominium and no power is reserved to a declarant to make the condominium part of a larger condominium, group of condominiums or other real estate, a public offering statement may but need not include the information otherwise required by subsection (a)(3), (4) and (18) and the narrative descriptions of documents required by subsection (a)(5).

This subsection does not apply to any convertible or withdrawable real estate in which no unit has been conveyed.

      "text": "§ 3410. Condominiums containing conversion buildings. (a) Notice of conversion.-- The declarant of every condominium containing one or more conversion buildings shall give each of the residential tenants and residential subtenants, if any, lawfully in possession of a unit or units in a conversion building or buildings, a conversion notice no later than one year before the declarant will require such residential tenant and residential subtenant to vacate. The conversion notice must set forth generally the rights of residential tenants and residential subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States certified or registered mail return receipt requested to the residential tenant and residential subtenant at the address of the unit and not more than one other mailing address provided by a residential tenant. Every notice shall be accompanied by a public offering statement concerning the proposed sale of condominium units within such building or buildings. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), no residential tenant or residential subtenant in a conversion building may be required by the declarant to vacate the unit he leases earlier than one year after the conversion notice date, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises and the terms of the tenancy, including those terms that apply to a period occurring in whole or in part after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during that period. Failure of a declarant to give notice to a residential tenant or residential subtenant entitled to such notice pursuant to this subsection is a defense to an action for possession against such residential tenant or residential subtenant. (b) Offer to tenant to purchase unit.-- For six months after the conversion notice date, the declarant shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use in a conversion building to the tenant who leases that unit. If the tenant fails to purchase his unit during that six-month period, the declarant may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following six months at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection shall not apply to any rental unit which immediately prior to the conversion notice date was restricted or devoted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of which unit, after the creation of the condominium, will not substantially conform to the boundaries of such unit on the conversion notice date. (c) Effect of wrongful conveyance.-- If a declarant, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, recordation of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that unit if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection (b) but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of subsection (b). (d) Notice to vacate.-- If a conversion notice specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, the conversion notice also constitutes a notice of termination of the tenant's lease, subject to revocation in accordance with subsection (i), and a notice to quit specified by section 501 of the act of April 6, 1951 (P.L.69, No.20), known as The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951. (e) Improper lease termination prohibited.-- (1) Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms. (2) Nothing in this section or in any lease shall prohibit a residential tenant, after receiving notice pursuant to subsection (a), from terminating any lease without any liability for such termination provided such tenant gives the building owner 90 days' written notice of the intent to terminate the lease. (3) The declarant or owner of any proposed conversion condominium shall not engage in any activity of any nature which would coerce the tenant into terminating any lease, including but not limited to stampeding, harassing tenants or withholding normal services or repairs. (f) Units leased to senior citizens and disabled persons.-- (1) For the purpose of this subsection, an eligible tenant or subtenant shall be a natural person who, on the conversion notice date, lawfully occupies a unit in a conversion building as his principal residence and is 62 years of age or older or is disabled, and has occupied the unit for at least two years. For the purpose of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to be \"disabled\" if on the conversion notice date he is totally and permanently unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impediment, including, but not limited to, blindness. (2) Within 60 days after the conversion notice date, any tenant, or subtenant, in possession of a unit, who believes that he is an eligible tenant or subtenant shall so notify the declarant and shall provide the declarant with proof of his eligibility. Any eligible tenant or subtenant who has established his eligibility as aforesaid shall be entitled to remain in possession of his unit for two years following the conversion notice date, notwithstanding any prior termination date in his lease, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other occupants' peaceful enjoyment of the condominium, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a time period after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during the time period between the original lease termination date and the expiration of this two-year period except as is otherwise provided in paragraph (3). (3) The monthly rental payable by the tenant during the time period commencing upon the later to occur of the original lease termination date or the first anniversary of the conversion notice date and ending upon the expiration of the two-year period described in paragraph (2) shall be the same monthly rental as was payable for the month immediately preceding the original lease termination date, except that, at the landlord's option, such monthly rental may be increased by the lesser of 5% of such monthly rental or the same percentage increase as the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor for the six-month time period commencing on the first day of the first full calendar month after the conversion notice date. (4) Failure of a declarant to comply with the provisions of this subsection is a defense to an action for possession. (g) Tenant meetings; open to the public.-- With respect to any conversion building containing one or more units then occupied for residential use, at least 30 days before the conversion notice date, the declarant shall hold a tenant meeting open to the public in the municipality where the proposed conversion building is located at a place and time convenient to the persons who may be directly affected by the conversion. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given to residential tenants and subtenants in lawful possession of their units in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice and to the general public by a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the condominium is located, except that no notice to the general public need be given with respect to conversion buildings as to which the provisions of section 3402(b) (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) are applicable. At such meeting, representatives of the declarant shall briefly describe the following and may, but shall not be required to, discuss other matters: (1) The rights and obligations of tenants and subtenants pursuant to this section. (2) Improvements, if any, then planned to be made to the condominium by the declarant. (3) The anticipated approximate range of initial unit sales prices. Specific unit sales prices need not, however, be provided. (4) The anticipated approximate range of estimated monthly common expenses for various types of units, however, specific per unit estimates need not be provided. (h) Community development grants.-- If Federal funds under Title I of the Community Development Act of 1974 have been used to finance the rehabilitation of multifamily rental housing, with the intent that such housing subsequent to the rehabilitation is to be used for residential rental purposes, such housing shall not be converted to a condominium for a period of ten years from the date the rehabilitation is completed. (i) Revocation.-- A declarant may subsequently revoke a conversion notice if the declarant has expressly reserved the right of revocation in the conversion notice and if the notice of revocation: (1) is given prior to the conveyance of any unit in the condominium occurring after the conversion notice date other than a unit or units conveyed to a successor declarant or as a result of foreclosure of a mortgage on the unit or a deed in lieu thereof; (2) is given in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice; and (3) is given to all persons who were entitled to receive the conversion notice and who continue to be in lawful occupancy at the time such notice of revocation is given. The giving of a notice of revocation revokes all rights granted under this section, but does not revoke the rights granted to residential tenants under subsection (a) or (f), and such rights shall be deemed to have been incorporated in each residential tenant's lease. (j) Waiver of purchase rights.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this subpart prohibiting waiver of rights, any tenant may waive his right to purchase a unit pursuant to subsection (b) if the waiver is in writing, is acknowledged and is given in consideration of: (1) an extension of the term of the tenant's tenancy and right of occupancy under this subpart beyond the time period required by subsection (a) or (f) as applicable; (2) the tenant entering into an agreement to purchase another unit in the condominium; or (3) all occupants of the unit making alternative living arrangements. (k) Alteration of terms of tenancy.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (a) or (f), the terms of the tenancy of a tenant or subtenant may be altered with the express written consent of that tenant or subtenant, and such altered terms shall then be the terms of tenancy referred to in this section. (l) Application of section.-- The provisions of this section shall apply only with respect to conversion buildings in which one or more residential tenants or residential subtenants are in lawful occupancy on the conversion notice date and the only tenants who are entitled to exercise the rights granted under this section are residential tenants or residential subtenants: (1) who are in lawful occupancy of conversion building on the date the declarant gives the conversion notice; or (2) who commence their tenancy after the notice of conversion is given to the other residential tenants without having been notified in writing, at or prior to the commencement of their tenancy, that the property is then a condominium and that they are not entitled to the rights granted under this section. Such rights continue only so long as the lawful occupancy of the tenant or subtenant continues.

      "text": "§ 3411. Warranty against structural defects. (a) Definition.-- As used in this section, \"structural defects\" means those defects in components constituting any unit or common element which reduce the stability or safety of the structure below accepted standards or restrict the normal intended use of all or part of the structure and which require repair, renovation, restoration or replacement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make the declarant responsible for any items of maintenance relating to the units or common elements. (b) General rule.-- A declarant warrants against structural defects in each of the units for two years from the date each is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser, and all of the common elements for two years. Any conveyance of a unit during the two-year warranty period shall be deemed to transfer to the purchaser all of the declarant's warranties created under this section. The two years shall begin as to each of the common elements whenever the common element has been completed or, if later: (1) as to any common element within any additional real estate or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; (2) as to any common element within any convertible real estate or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; and (3) as to any common element within any other portion of the condominium, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (c) Condominiums containing conversion buildings.-- A declarant of a condominium containing one or more conversion buildings warrants as follows: (1) That there are no structural defects in components installed anywhere in the condominium by or on behalf of the declarant or in work done or improvements made by or on behalf of the declarant anywhere in the condominium. (2) That all units and common elements in each conversion building have been inspected for visible structural and mechanical defects and for other visible conditions that adversely affect the health or safety of residential occupants, as required by section 3404(a)(1) (relating to public offering statement; condominiums containing conversion buildings), except that no such inspection is required of any unit if the tenant or other lawful occupant of the unit does not permit such inspection to be conducted. (3) That any such defects and other visible conditions found have been repaired. The warranties set forth in subsection (b) shall be applicable to any units and common elements that are located within a building that contains or comprises one or more units and is not a conversion building. Otherwise, such a declarant may offer the units, common elements, or both, in an \"as is\" condition. The declarant of a condominium containing any conversion buildings may also give a more extensive warranty in writing. The times at which the warranties required by this subsection commence and the duration of such warranties shall be as provided in subsection (b). (d) Exclusion or modification of warranty.-- Except with respect to a purchaser of a unit for residential use, the warranty against structural defects: (1) may be excluded or modified by agreement of the parties; and (2) is excluded by expression of disclaimer, such as \"as is,\" \"with all faults\" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties. (e) Limitation of actions.-- No action to enforce the warranty created by this section shall be commenced later than six years after the warranty begins, provided, however, that the limitation period affecting a right of action by the association under this section shall be six years after the warranty begins or two years after the unit owners elect an executive board under section 3303(e) (relating to executive board members and officers), whichever is later.

(a) General rule.-- To exercise any development right reserved under section 4205(a)(8) (relating to contents of declaration), the declarant shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration (section 4216). If the exercise of such development rights causes real estate to be added to a cooperative or withdrawn from a cooperative, the amendment to the declaration shall either convey or refer to the instrument conveying the real estate so added or withdrawn and shall contain a legally sufficient description of the real estate. The amendment to the declaration must also assign an identifying number to each new unit created, if appropriate, and reallocate the allocated interests among all cooperative interests. The amendment must also describe any common elements and any limited common elements thereby created and, in the case of limited common elements, designate the unit to which each is allocated to the extent required by section 4208 (relating to limited common elements). (b) Reservation of development rights.-- Development rights may be reserved within any real estate added to the cooperative if the amendment adding that real estate includes all matters required by section 4205 or 4206 (relating to leasehold cooperatives), as the case may be. This provision does not extend the time limit on the exercise of development rights imposed by the declaration pursuant to section 4205(b)(1). (c) Subdivision or conversion of unit.-- Whenever a declarant exercises a development right to subdivide or convert a unit previously created into additional units, common elements or both: (1) If the declarant converts the unit entirely to common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the cooperative interest of which that unit is a part among the other cooperative interests as if that unit had been taken by eminent domain (section 4107). (2) If the declarant subdivides the unit into two or more units, whether or not any part of the unit is converted into common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the cooperative interests created by the subdivision in any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant. (d) Withdrawal of real estate.-- If the declaration provides, pursuant to section 4205(a)(8), that all or a portion of the real estate is subject to the development right of withdrawal: (1) If all of the real estate is subject to withdrawal and the declaration does not describe separate portions of real estate subject to that right, none of the real estate may be withdrawn after a cooperative interest has been conveyed to a purchaser. (2) If a portion or portions are subject to withdrawal, no portion may be withdrawn after a cooperative interest in the portion has been conveyed to a purchaser. Cross References.

(b) Limitation of action to challenge amendment.-- No action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted by the association pursuant to this section may be brought more than six months after the amendment is recorded. (c) Recording amendment.-- The following shall apply: (1) Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in every county in which any portion of the cooperative is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and is effective only upon recordation. In cases where the amendment is executed by the association, it shall be indexed in the name of the cooperative and the association in both the grantor and the grantee index.

(3) Change the uses to which any unit is restricted without the approval of the proprietary lessee of such unit. (e) Officer authorized to execute amendment.-- Amendments to the declaration required by this subpart to be recorded by the association shall be prepared, executed, recorded and certified on behalf of the association by any officer of the association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of designation, by the president of the association. (f) Corrective amendments.-- Except as otherwise provided in the declaration, if any amendment to the declaration is necessary in the judgment of the executive board to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision of the declaration that is defective, missing or inconsistent with any other provision thereof or with this subpart or if an amendment is necessary in the judgment of the executive board to conform to the requirements of any agency or entity that has established national or regional standards with respect to loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on units in cooperative projects (such as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), to comply with any statute, regulation, code or ordinance which may now or hereafter be made applicable to the cooperative or association, or to make a reasonable accommodation or permit a reasonable modification in favor of handicapped, as may be defined by prevailing Federal or State laws or regulations applicable to the association, proprietary lessees, residents or employees, then, at any time and from time to time, the executive board may at its discretion effect an appropriate corrective amendment without the approval of the proprietary lessees or the holders of any liens on all or any part of the cooperative, upon receipt by the executive board of an opinion from legal counsel who is independent from the declarant to the effect that the proposed amendment is permitted by the terms of this subsection.

(a) Number of votes required.-- Except: (1) in the case of the taking of all of the units by eminent domain (section 4107); (2) in the case of foreclosure of a security interest against the entire cooperative which has priority over the declaration or which is subordinate to a declaration that expressly provides that the holder of the security interest has the right to terminate the cooperative when the foreclosure of the security interest has been consummated; or (3) in the case of the expiration or termination of a lease which has priority over the declaration (unless a contrary intent is expressly stated in the lease); cooperative ownership may be terminated only at a meeting of the association and by the vote, in person or by proxy, of proprietary lessees of cooperative interests to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the cooperative are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (b) Execution and recording of termination agreement.-- An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of proprietary lessees. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a proprietary lessee. If, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real estate in the cooperative is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the terms of the sale. The termination agreement will become null and void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of: (1) The expiration of the year from the date and all ratifications thereof it was first executed and ratified by a proprietary lessee. (2) Such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the cooperative is situated in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and indexed in the name of the cooperative and the association in both the grantor index and the grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recordation. (c) Status if real estate sold.-- The association, on behalf of the proprietary lessees, may contract for the sale of real estate in the cooperative, but the contract is not binding until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Except to the extent that any provisions in the declaration limit the amount that may be received by a proprietary lessee upon termination (section 4205(a)(10)), proceeds of the sale must be distributed to holders of liens against the association, against the cooperative interests and to proprietary lessees, all as their interests may appear, in accordance with subsections (d) and (e) with proprietary lessees being entitled to receive the entire balance of the association's assets, after payment of all such lienholders, pursuant to subsection (e), except that, in the case of a limited equity cooperative with a declaration of the type described in section 4321(e) (relating to limited equity cooperatives), the provisions of that section shall govern. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each proprietary lessee and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of that occupancy, each proprietary lessee and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on proprietary lessees by this subpart or the declaration. (d) Priority of liens.-- Following termination of the cooperative, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for proprietary lessees and holders of liens against the association and the cooperative interests as their interests may appear. The declaration may provide that all creditors of the association have priority over any interests of proprietary lessees and creditors of proprietary lessees. In that event, following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative which were perfected before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lienholder, and any other creditor of the association is to be treated as if he had perfected a lien against the cooperative immediately before termination. Unless the declaration provides that all creditors of the association have that priority: (1) The lien of each creditor of the association which was perfected against the association before termination becomes, upon termination, a lien against each cooperative interest as of the date the lien was perfected. (2) Any other creditor of the association is to be treated upon termination as if he had perfected a lien against the cooperative interests immediately before termination. (3) The amount of the lien of an association's creditor described in paragraphs (1) and (2) against each of the cooperative interests must be proportionate to the ratio which that cooperative interest's common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all of the cooperative interests. (4) The one lien, unless the declaration designates a greater number, against each proprietary lessee which was perfected prior to any other liens against the proprietary lessee and before termination continues as a lien against the proprietary lessee's cooperative interest as of the date the lien was perfected. (5) Any other creditor of a proprietary lessee is to be treated upon termination as if he had perfected a lien against that proprietary lessee immediately before termination. (6) The assets of the association shall be distributed to all proprietary lessees and all lienholders against their cooperative interests as their interests may appear in the order described in paragraphs (1) through (5), and creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any proprietary lessee in excess of the amount of the creditor's lien against that proprietary lessee's cooperative interest. Regardless of the priority given to creditors of the association, no proprietary lessee shall have any personal liability to a creditor of the association beyond such proprietary lessee's cooperative interest. (e) Valuation of proprietary lessee's interest.-- The declaration may provide that the respective interests of proprietary lessees referred to in subsections (c) and (d) are the fair market values of the cooperative interests as of a date no earlier than six months prior to the termination as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the proprietary lessees at least 30 days prior to a meeting of the association at which meeting the appraisal will be deemed approved unless it is rejected by vote, in person or by proxy, of proprietary lessees holding more than 50% of the votes in the association. If the declaration provides for such an appraisal procedure, the proportion of any proprietary lessee's interest to that of all proprietary lessees is determined by dividing the fair market value of that proprietary lessee's cooperative interest by the total fair market values of all the cooperative interests. If the declaration does not provide for such an appraisal procedure or if the appraisal is rejected by the requisite number of votes in the association, the interests of all proprietary lessees are their respective ownership interests in the association immediately before the termination. If the declaration provides for an appraisal procedure, there shall be no vote taken among the proprietary lessees as to whether or not the cooperative form of ownership should be terminated until after the vote is first taken as to whether or not the appraisal should be approved. (f) Termination by successor in title.-- In the case of a foreclosure of a lien against the entire cooperative or in the case of the expiration or termination of a lease which has priority over the declaration, the successor in title shall have the right to terminate the cooperative. (g) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.-- In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the cooperative other than a provision providing for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the cooperative would otherwise be terminated the owners of at least 80% of the units in the cooperative vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.

(2) Prevent the association or the executive board from commencing, intervening in or settling any litigation or proceeding. (3) Receive and distribute any insurance proceeds except pursuant to section 4313 (relating to insurance). (b) Secured lender approval procedures.-- If the declaration requires mortgagees or beneficiaries of deeds of trust encumbering the units to approve specified actions of the proprietary lessees or the association as a condition to the effectiveness of those actions, then the executive board will provide the lender with written notice of the specified action proposed to be taken, together with a request for the secured lender to approve or disapprove the actions specified. If the notice to the secured lender, issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subsection, states that the secured lender will be deemed to have approved the actions specified in the written notice if it does not respond to the request within 45 days and the secured lender does not respond in writing within 45 days, then the secured lender will be deemed for all purposes to have approved the action specified in the notice. Written notice to the secured lender shall be given by certified, registered or first-class mail, evidenced by a United States Postal Service certificate of mailing, postage prepaid, at the address provided by the secured lender or, in the absence thereof, at the address of the secured lender endorsed on any mortgage or deed of trust of record and at the address to which the unit owner mails any periodic payment paid to the secured lender.

      "text": "§ 4219. Master associations. (a) General rule.-- If the declaration provides that any of the powers described in section 4302 (relating to powers of association) are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association (a \"master association\") which exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more cooperatives, condominiums, homeowners associations or any combination of the foregoing or for the benefit of the proprietary lessees of one or more cooperatives, unit owners of one or more condominiums, members of one or more homeowners associations or some combination of the foregoing, all provisions of this subpart applicable to associations apply to any such corporation or unincorporated association insofar as such association is acting on behalf of one or more cooperatives, except as modified by this section. (b) Exercise of powers of association.-- Unless a master association is acting in the capacity of an association described in section 4301 (relating to organization of association), it may exercise the powers set forth in section 4302 only to the extent expressly permitted in the declarations of the cooperatives which are part of the master association or expressly described in the delegations of power from those cooperatives to the master association. (c) Liability for exercise of delegated powers.-- If the declaration of any cooperative provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board have no liability for the acts of omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following delegation. The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the cooperative association whose powers are delegated thereto and the proprietary lessees of such cooperative on the same basis as officers and executive board members of such cooperative immediately before such delegation of power. (d) Rights and liabilities of proprietary lessees.-- The rights and responsibilities of proprietary lessees with respect to the association set forth in sections 4303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 4308 (relating to meetings), 4309 (relating to quorums), 4310 (relating to voting; proxies), 4312 (relating to conveyance or encumbrance of cooperative) and 4320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association only to those persons who elect the board of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise proprietary lessees within the meaning of this subpart. (e) Election of executive board.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4303(f) with respect to the election of the executive board of an association by all proprietary lessees after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 4301, the certificate of incorporation or other instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each cooperative, the powers of which are assigned by the declaration or delegated to the master association, may provide that the executive board of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways: (1) All proprietary lessees of all cooperatives subject to the master association may elect all members of that executive board. (2) All members of the executive boards of all cooperatives subject to the master association may elect all members of that executive board. (3) All proprietary lessees of each cooperative subject to the master association may elect specified members of the executive board. (4) All members of the executive boards of each cooperative subject to the master association may elect specified members of that executive board. (e.1) Independent reviewer.-- The certificate of incorporation or other instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each cooperative, the powers of which are assigned by the declaration or delegated to the master association, shall provide that a vote by a proprietary lessee in an election of the executive board of an association must be submitted by the proprietary lessee to an independent reviewer who shall tally the results of the election and certify the results to the executive board and proprietary lessees. In order to be eligible to vote in the election, a proprietary lessee shall be in good standing with the master association. The executive board shall present the official election results based on the certified election report from the independent reviewer at a meeting of the proprietary lessees and shall enter the results in the meeting records. All votes by proprietary lessees under this subsection shall be submitted to the independent reviewer in accordance with the approved methods of voting as provided under this subpart. This subsection shall only apply to a cooperative with at least 500 units. If a cooperative has less than 500 units, the master association may opt in to the requirements under this subsection by a vote of at least 51% of the votes collected from the unit owners in person, electronically or by absentee ballot which are in favor of the requirements under this subsection. (f) When section applicable to cooperative.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to a cooperative if and when: (1) there occurs either a date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the cooperative; (2) there occurs an event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable, and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that: (i) such event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the cooperative; and (ii) that a copy of such instrument has been sent to all proprietary lessees; or (3) the declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the cooperative and that a copy of the instrument has been sent to the executive board and all proprietary lessees. Paragraph (3) shall be applicable only if the declarant expressly reserved in the declaration, pursuant to section 4205(a)(8) (relating to contents of declaration), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the cooperative and only if the instrument exercising such right is recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right. (g) When executive board not required.-- If all of the powers of a cooperative association are delegated to a master association and accepted by the master association pursuant to this section, then the governing body of the master association may act in all respects as the executive board of the cooperative and no separate executive board need be elected or exist.

The resultant cooperative shall, in addition, be subject in all respects to the provisions and requirements of this subpart regardless of whether or not any of the preexisting cooperatives have been established under this subpart. (b) Execution and recording of agreement.-- The merger or consolidation of two or more cooperatives pursuant to subsection (a) must be evidenced by a recorded agreement duly executed by the president of the association of each of the preexisting cooperatives following approval by proprietary lessees of cooperative interests to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each cooperative required to terminate that cooperative. Any such agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the cooperative is located and is not effective until so recorded. (c) Reallocation of allocated interests.-- Every merger or consolidation agreement must provide for the reallocation of the allocated interests in the new association among the cooperative interests of the resultant cooperative either: (1) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based; or (2) by stating the percentage of overall allocated interests of the new cooperative which are allocated to all of the cooperative interests comprising each of the preexisting cooperatives and providing that the portion of the percentages allocated to each cooperative interest formerly comprising a part of the preexisting cooperative must be equal to the percentages of allocated interests allocated to that cooperative interest by the declaration of the preexisting cooperative. (d) Execution of agreement by declarant who retained rights.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), if a declarant expressly retained the special declarant right to merge or consolidate a cooperative pursuant to section 4205(a)(8) (relating to contents of declaration) and if the declarant exercised such right within the time period allowed for such exercise by giving written notice to that effect to all proprietary lessees accompanied by a copy of the agreement evidencing such merger or consolidation, then such agreement may be executed by the declarant rather than by the president of the association of that cooperative and without the necessity for approval or consent by proprietary lessees or their mortgagees provided the agreement is recorded within the time period allowed for the exercise of this special declarant right.

      "text": "§ 4311. Tort and contract liability. (a) General rule.-- Neither the association nor any proprietary lessee except the declarant is liable for that declarant's torts in connection with any part of the cooperative which that declarant has the responsibility to maintain. Otherwise, an action alleging a wrong done by the association must be brought against the association and not against any proprietary lessee. If the wrong occurred during any period of declarant control, the declarant who then controlled the association is liable to the association or to any proprietary lessee: (1) For all tort losses suffered by the association or that proprietary lessee not covered by insurance. (2) For all costs which the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or other wrongful act or omission. (b) Claims after declarant control.-- If a claim for a tort or breach of contract is made after the period of declarant control, the association shall have no right against the declarant under this section unless the association has given the declarant: (1) Notice of the existence of such a claim promptly after the date on which one or more members of the executive board who are not designees of the declarant learns of the existence of such a claim. (2) An opportunity to defend against such claim on behalf of the association but at the declarant's expense. (c) Liability for litigation expenses.-- Whenever the declarant is liable to the association under this section, the declarant is also liable for all litigation expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the association. (d) Tolling statute of limitations.-- Any statute of limitation affecting the association's right of action under this section is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates. (e) Proprietary lessee as party.-- A proprietary lessee is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this section because he is a proprietary lessee or a member or officer of the association. (f) Liens.-- Liens resulting from judgments against the association are governed by section 4316 (relating to other liens affecting cooperative). Cross References.

(a) General rule.-- Except as is otherwise provided in section 4321(h) (relating to limited equity cooperatives), part of the cooperative may be conveyed and all or part of the cooperative may be subjected to a security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at least 66 2/3% of the votes in the association, including 66 2/3% of the votes allocated to cooperative interests not owned by a declarant or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action. Except as is otherwise provided in section 4321(h), if fewer than all the units or limited common elements are to be conveyed or subjected to a security interest, then all the proprietary lessees of those units or the units to which those limited common elements are allocated must agree in order to convey those units or limited common elements or subject them to a security interest. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association. (b) Execution and recording of agreement to convey or encumber.-- An agreement to convey a part of the cooperative or subject it to a security interest must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of proprietary lessees. The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date. The agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the cooperative is situated and is effective only upon recordation. (c) Powers of association.-- The association, on behalf of the proprietary lessees, may contract to convey a part of the cooperative or subject it to a security interest, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary to execute deeds or other instruments. (d) Unauthorized conveyance or encumbrance void.-- Any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, tax sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of the cooperative, unless made pursuant to this section or section 4217(c) (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), is void. (e) Right of access and support preserved.-- A conveyance or encumbrance of the cooperative pursuant to this section does not deprive any unit of its rights of access and support. (f) Subject to declaration.-- A part of the cooperative which is subject to the declaration prior to conveyance or encumbrance shall remain subject to the provisions of the declaration following the conveyance or encumbrance, unless the deed or agreement to convey the cooperative or subject it to a security interest specifically provides otherwise.

      "text": "§ 4313. Insurance. (a) Insurance to be carried by association.-- Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a cooperative interest to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available: (1) Property insurance on the common elements and units insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against or, in the case of a conversion building, against fire and extended coverage perils. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies. (2) Liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements and units. (3) Any property or comprehensive general liability insurance carried by the association may contain a deductible provision. (b) Other insurance carried by association.-- If the insurance described in subsection (a) is not reasonably available, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by the United States mail to all proprietary lessees. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance in such reasonable amounts and with such reasonable deductibles as the executive board may deem appropriate to protect the association or the proprietary lessees. (c) Contents of insurance policies.-- Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection (a) must provide that: (1) Each proprietary lessee is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his interest in the common elements or membership in the association. (2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any proprietary lessee or member of his household. (3) No act or omission by any proprietary lessee, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy. (4) If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a proprietary lessee covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance. (d) Proceeds from property insurance.-- Any loss covered by the property policy under subsection (a)(1) must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose or otherwise to the association and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a mortgage or deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for the association, proprietary lessees and the lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (g), the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and the association, proprietary lessees and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored or the cooperative is terminated. (e) Unit owner may obtain insurance.-- A proprietary lessee may insure the lessee's unit for all losses to his unit, including losses not covered by the insurance maintained by the association, due to a deductible provision or otherwise. An insurance policy issued to the association shall not prevent a proprietary lessee from obtaining insurance for his own benefit, including insurance to cover any deductibles or losses not covered by the association's property or comprehensive general liability insurance. (f) Evidence and cancellation of insurance.-- An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any proprietary lessee or holder of a security interest. The insurer issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse to renew it until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each proprietary lessee and each holder of a security interest to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses. (g) Disposition of insurance proceeds.-- (1) Any portion of the cooperative for which insurance is required under this section which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless: (i) the cooperative is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80% of the proprietary lessees, including every proprietary lessee of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. Except for the costs of repair or replacement which are not covered due to deductibles, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves which have not been identified by the executive board to fund costs of capital expenditures for the current fiscal year of the association is a common expense. (2) If the entire cooperative is not repaired or replaced: (i) the insurance proceeds attributed to the damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the cooperative; and (ii) except to the extent that other persons will be distributees and except as is otherwise provided in section 4321(i) (relating to limited equity cooperatives): (A) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements which are not rebuilt must be distributed to the proprietary lessees of those units and the proprietary lessees of the units to which those limited common elements were located or to lienholders, as their interests may appear; and (B) the remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to all the proprietary lessees or lienholders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common expense liabilities of all the cooperative interests. If the proprietary lessees vote not to rebuild any unit, the allocated interests of the cooperative interest of which that unit is a part are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under section 4107(a) (relating to eminent domain), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, section 4217 (relating to termination of cooperative ownership) governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the cooperative is terminated. (h) Nonresidential cooperative.-- The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a cooperative all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use. (i) Recovery of deductibles.-- If an insurance policy maintained by the association contains a deductible, then that portion of any loss or claim which is not covered by insurance due to the application of a deductible, as well as any claim or loss for which the association is self-insured, shall be levied by the executive board in accordance with section 4314(c) (relating to assessments for common expenses).

After any assessment has been made by the association, assessments must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least annually by the association, subject, however, to the provisions of section 4303(c) (relating to executive board members and officers) concerning ratification of the budget by the association. (b) Allocation and interest.-- Except for assessments under subsections (c), (d) and (e) and except as provided in subsection (g) with respect to cooperative interests owned by declarant, all common expenses must be assessed against all the cooperative interests in accordance with the allocations set forth in the declaration pursuant to section 4207(a) (relating to allocation of ownership interests, votes and common expense liabilities). Any past due common expense assessment or installment thereof shall bear interest at the rate established by the association from time to time by prior written notice to all propriety lessees. (c) Limited expenses.-- Unless otherwise required by the declaration or as is otherwise provided in section 4321(j) (relating to limited equity cooperatives): (1) any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair or replacement of a limited common element must be assessed against the cooperative interests for the units to which that limited common element is assigned equally or in any other proportion that the declaration provides; and (2) any common expense or portion thereof benefiting fewer than all of the units must be assessed exclusively against the cooperative interests for the units benefited. (d) Insurance costs.-- If required by the declaration, the costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk, and the costs of utilities must be assessed in proportion to usage. (e) Payment of judgments.-- Assessments to pay a judgment against the association (section 4317(a)) may be made only against the cooperative interests in the cooperative at the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities. (f) Common expense attributable to proprietary lessee.-- If any common expense is caused by the action or failure to act of any proprietary lessee, the association may assess that expense exclusively against him or his cooperative interest or both of them. (g) Reallocated common expense liabilities.-- If common expense liabilities are reallocated, common expense assessments and any installment thereof not yet due shall be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities. (h) Crediting of excess assessments.-- Any amounts accumulated from assessments for limited common expenses and income from the operation of limited common elements to which such limited common expenses pertain in excess of the amount required for actual limited common expenses and reserves for future limited common expenses shall be credited to the cooperative interest assessed for a share of such limited common expenses in proportion to the share of such limited common expenses so assessed. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the credits shall be applied to the next monthly assessments of limited common expenses against the cooperative interest under the then current fiscal year's budget and, thereafter, until exhausted. Any amounts accumulated from assessments for general common expenses and income from the operation of the common elements, other than limited common elements with regard to which limited common expenses are assessed, in excess of the amount required for actual general common expenses and reserve for future general common expenses shall be credited to each cooperative interest in accordance with the allocations set forth in the declaration, unless the declaration provides otherwise, to the next monthly assessments of general common expenses against the cooperative interest under the then current fiscal year's budget and thereafter, until exhausted.

(a) General rule.-- The association has a lien on a cooperative interest for any assessment levied against that cooperative interest, including payments to be made by declarant pursuant to section 4314(g) (relating to assessments for common expenses), or fines imposed against its owner from the time the assessment or fine becomes due. A judicial or other sale of the cooperative interest shall not affect the lien of a mortgage thereon if the mortgage is or shall be prior to all other liens upon the same property except those liens identified in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8152(a) (relating to judicial sale as affecting lien of mortgage) and liens for cooperative assessments created under this section. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines and interest charged pursuant to section 4302(a)(11) and (12) (relating to powers of association) and reasonable costs and expenses of the association, including legal fees, incurred in connection with collection of any sums due the association by the unit owner or enforcement of the provisions of the declaration, bylaws, rules or regulations against the unit owner are enforceable as assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in installments and one or more installments is not paid when due, the entire outstanding balance becomes effective as a lien from the due date of the delinquent installment. Upon nonpayment of the assessment, the proprietary lessee may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed by judicial sale of the cooperative interest in like manner as a mortgage on real estate. (b) Priority of lien.-- (1) A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a cooperative interest except: (i) Liens and encumbrances on the cooperative which the association creates, assumes or takes subject to. (ii) (A) The first security interest encumbering only the cooperative interest and perfected before the date on which the assessment or the first installment payable on the assessment, if the assessment is payable in installments, sought to be enforced became delinquent. (B) Judgments obtained for obligations secured by a security interest under clause (A). (iii) Liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the cooperative or the cooperative interest. (2) The association's lien for assessments shall be divested by a judicial sale of the cooperative interest: (i) As to unpaid common expense assessments made under section 4314(b) that come due during the six months immediately preceding the date of a judicial sale of a cooperative interest in an action to enforce collection of a lien against a cooperative interest by a judicial sale, only to the extent that the six months unpaid assessments are paid out of the proceeds of the sale. (ii) As to unpaid common expense assessments made under section 4314(b) other than the six months assessment referred to in subparagraph (i), in the full amount of these unpaid assessments, whether or not the proceeds of the judicial sale are adequate to pay these assessments. To the extent the proceeds of the sale are sufficient to pay some or all of these additional assessments, after satisfaction in full of the costs of the judicial sale, and the liens and encumbrances of the types described in paragraph (1) and the unpaid common expense assessments that come due during the six-month period described in subparagraph (i), they shall be paid before any remaining proceeds may be paid to any other claimant, including the prior owner of the cooperative interest. (3) The lien is not subject to the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8123 (relating to general monetary exemption). (c) Multiple liens on same property.-- Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority. (d) Notice and perfection of lien.-- Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. No further recordation or filing of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required. (e) Limitation of actions.-- A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within three years after the date on which the full amount of the assessment becomes due or, if paid in installments, the date on which the first installment payable on the assessment becomes due. (f) Other remedies preserved.-- This section does not prohibit actions to recover sums for which subsection (a) creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a transfer or assignment in lieu of foreclosure. (g) Costs and attorney fees.-- A judgment or decree in any action brought under this section must include costs and reasonable attorney fees for the prevailing party. (h) Statement of unpaid assessments.-- The association, upon written request, shall furnish to a proprietary lessee a statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments against his cooperative interest. The statement must be in recordable form. The statement must be furnished within ten business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive board and every proprietary lessee. (i) Application of payments.-- (1) Unless the declaration otherwise provides, any payment received by an association in connection with the lien under this section shall be applied: (i) First to any interest accrued by the association. (ii) Second to any late fee. (iii) Third to any costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the association in collection or enforcement. (iv) Last to the delinquent assessment. (2) Paragraph (1) shall apply notwithstanding any restrictive endorsement, designation or instructions placed on or accompanying a payment.

(a) General rule.-- Except as is otherwise expressly provided in this section, limited equity cooperatives shall be created and operated pursuant to the other provisions of this act.

(c) Alternation of units.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4210 (relating to alteration of units), if the association is responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement of the units as well as the common elements and limited common elements, as provided in subsection (g), a proprietary lessee may make improvements or alterations to his unit only with the prior permission of the association, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law. (d) Distribution to proprietary lessees upon termination of limited equity cooperatives.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4217 (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), distributions to proprietary lessees in limited equity cooperatives shall be no greater than the amount for which their respective cooperative interests could be transferred as restricted by the declaration and bylaws of the association. (e) Distribution of residual proceeds upon termination of limited equity cooperatives.-- If the declaration of a limited equity cooperative states that it is the declarant's intent that some or all units in the cooperative shall be affordable by low-income and moderate-income persons throughout the existence of the cooperative, then any assets of the association remaining after the distributions to lienholders and proprietary lessees as provided above and in the last sentence of section 4217(e) shall be distributed by the executive board to a public or private entity to be used in a manner consistent with the declarant's intent for the creation of additional housing affordable by low-income and moderate-income persons. If the balance of the funds is not so disbursed, the court of common pleas of the county in which the property is located is hereby authorized to distribute the funds as provided in this section.

(h) Subjecting a limited equity cooperative to a security interest.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4312(a) (relating to conveyance or encumbrance of cooperative) all or part of a limited equity cooperative may be subjected to a security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at least 51% of the votes in the association, including 51% of the votes allocated to cooperative interests not owned by a declarant or any larger percentage the declaration specifies agree to that action. If fewer than all the units or limited common elements in a limited equity cooperative are to be subjected to a security interest, then all of the proprietary lessees of those units or the units to which those limited common elements are allocated must consent in order to subject them to a security interest, except that the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall govern unless the declaration provides, pursuant to subsection (g), that expenses related to the limited common elements shall be common expenses. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (i) Disposition of insurance proceeds.-- The disposition of insurance proceeds due proprietary lessees in limited equity cooperatives under section 4313(g)(2)(ii) (relating to insurance) shall be limited to the amount for which the proprietary lessee's cooperative interest may be sold pursuant to the controlling provisions of the declaration and the bylaws of the association.

      "heading": "containing conversion buildings.",
      "text": "§ 4412. Cooperatives containing conversion buildings. (a) Notice of conversion.-- The declarant of every cooperative containing one or more conversion buildings shall give each of the residential tenants and subtenants, if any, lawfully in possession of a unit or units in a conversion building a conversion notice no later than one year before the declarant will require residential tenants and residential subtenants to vacate, subject to revocation of such notice in accordance with subsection (k). The conversion notice must set forth generally the rights of residential tenants and residential subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the residential tenant and residential subtenant at the address of the unit and not more than one other mailing address provided by a residential tenant. Every notice shall be accompanied by a public offering statement concerning the proposed sale of cooperative interests within such conversion building or buildings. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), no such residential tenant or residential subtenant in a conversion building may be required to vacate the unit he leases earlier than one year after the conversion notice date, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a period occurring in whole or in part after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during that period. Failure to give notice to a residential tenant or residential subtenant entitled to such notice pursuant to this subsection is a defense to an action for possession against such residential tenant or residential subtenant. (b) Offer to tenant to purchase cooperative interest.-- For six months after the conversion notice date, the declarant shall offer to convey the cooperative interest for each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use in a conversion building to the tenant who leases that unit. If the tenant fails to purchase the cooperative interest during that six-month period, the offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in that cooperative interest during the following six months at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection shall not apply to any cooperative interest in a conversion building if the unit which is part of that cooperative interest was, immediately prior to the conversion notice date, restricted or devoted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of which unit, after the creation of the cooperative, will not substantially conform to the boundaries of such unit on the conversion notice date. (c) Effect of wrongful conveyance.-- If a declarant, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a cooperative interest to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, that conveyance extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that cooperative interest if the deed states that the declarant has complied with subsection (b), but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of subsection (b). (d) Notice to vacate.-- If a conversion notice specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, the conversion notice also constitutes a notice of termination of the tenant's lease, subject to revocation in accordance with subsection (k) and a notice to quit specified by section 501 of the act of April 6, 1951 (P.L.69, No.20), known as The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951. (e) Improper lease termination prohibited.-- (1) Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease in violation of its terms. (2) Nothing in this section or in any lease shall prohibit a residential tenant, after receiving notice pursuant to subsection (a), from terminating any lease without any liability for such termination provided such tenant gives the building owner at least 90 days' written notice of the intent to terminate the lease. (3) The declarant and, if different, the owner shall not engage in any activity of any nature which would coerce any residential tenant of a conversion building into terminating any lease, including, but not limited to, stampeding, harassing tenants or withholding normal services or repairs. (f) Units leased to senior citizens and blind and disabled persons.-- (1) For the purpose of this subsection, an eligible tenant or subtenant shall be a natural person who, on the conversion notice date, lawfully occupies the unit as his principal residence and is 62 years of age or older or is disabled. For the purpose of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to be \"disabled\" if, on the conversion notice date, he is totally and permanently unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impediment, including, but not limited to, blindness. (2) Within 60 days after the conversion notice date, any tenant or subtenant in possession of a unit who believes that he is an eligible tenant or subtenant shall so notify the declarant and shall provide the declarant with proof of his eligibility. Any eligible tenant or subtenant who has established his eligibility shall be entitled to remain in possession of his unit for two years following the conversion notice date, notwithstanding any prior termination date in his lease, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other occupants' peaceful enjoyment of the cooperative, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a time period after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during the time period between the original lease termination date and the expiration of this two-year period, except as is provided in paragraph (3). (3) The monthly rental payable by the tenant during the time period between the later to occur of the original lease termination date or the first anniversary of the conversion notice date and the expiration of the two-year period described in paragraph (2) sentence shall be the same monthly rental as was payable for the month immediately preceding the original lease termination date, except that, at the landlord's option, such monthly rental may be increased by the lesser of 5% of such monthly rental or the same percentage increase as the percentage increase, if any, in the cost of living in the United States during the six-month time period commencing on the first day of the first full calendar month after the conversion notice date. (4) Failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection is a defense to an action for possession. (g) Tenant meetings.-- With respect to any cooperative containing a conversion building with one or more units then occupied for residential use, at least 30 days before the conversion notice date, the declarant shall hold a tenant meeting open to the public in the municipality where the conversion is proposed at a place and time convenient to the persons who may be directly affected by the conversion. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given to tenants and subtenants in lawful possession of their units in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice and to the general public by a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the cooperative is located, except that no notice to the general public need be given with respect to conversion buildings in cooperatives as to which the provisions of section 4401(b) (relating to applicability; waiver) are applicable. At such meeting, representatives of the declarant shall briefly describe the following and may, but shall not be required to, discuss other matters: (1) The rights and obligations of tenants and subtenants pursuant to this section. (2) Improvements, if any, then planned to be made to the cooperative. (3) The anticipated approximate range of initial cooperative interest sales prices, but specific sales prices need not be provided. (4) The anticipated approximate range of estimated monthly common expense liabilities for various types of cooperative interests but specific per cooperative interest estimates need not be provided. (h) Waiver of right to purchase.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this subpart prohibiting waiver of rights, any tenant or subtenant may waive his right to purchase a cooperative interest pursuant to subsection (b) if the waiver is in writing, is acknowledged and is given in consideration of: (1) a written extension of the term of that tenant's tenancy and right of occupancy under this subpart beyond the time period required by subsection (a) or (f) as applicable; (2) the tenant entering into an agreement to purchase another cooperative interest in the cooperative; or (3) the tenant or subtenant making alternative living arrangements. (i) Alteration of term of tenancy.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (a) or (f), the terms of the tenancy of a tenant or subtenant may be altered with the express written consent of that tenant or subtenant, and such altered terms shall then be the terms of tenancy referred to in this section. (j) Limitation to tenants in occupancy.-- The provisions of this section shall apply only with respect to conversion buildings in which one or more residential tenants or residential subtenants is in lawful occupancy on the conversion notice date, and the only tenants who are entitled to exercise the rights granted under this section are residential tenants or residential subtenants: (1) who are in lawful occupancy of a conversion building on the conversion notice date; or (2) who commence their tenancy after the conversion notice date without having been notified in writing at or prior to the commencement of their tenancy that the property is then a cooperative and that they are not entitled to the rights granted under this section. Such rights continue only so long as the lawful occupancy of the tenant or subtenant continues. (k) Revocation of conversion notice.-- A declarant may subsequently revoke a conversion notice if the declarant has expressly reserved the right of revocation in the conversion notice and if the notice of revocation: (1) is given prior to the conveyance of any unit in the cooperative occurring after the conversion notice date other than a cooperative interest or cooperative interests conveyed to a successor declarant or as a result of a foreclosure of a mortgage on a cooperative interest or a deed in lieu thereof; (2) is given in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice; and (3) is given to all persons who were entitled to receive the conversion notice and who continue to be in lawful occupancy at the time such notice of revocation is given. The giving of a notice of revocation revokes all rights granted under this section, but does not revoke the rights granted to residential tenants under subsection (a) or (f), and such rights shall be deemed to have been incorporated in each residential tenant's lease.

(2) Any model or description of the physical characteristics of the cooperative, including plans and specifications of or for improvements, if incorporated by reference in a public offering statement or other written statement or document signed by the seller and relied upon by the buyer in accordance with this subsection creates an express warranty that the cooperative will conform substantially to the model or description. (3) Any description of the quantity or extent of the real estate comprising the cooperative if incorporated by reference in a public offering statement or other written statement or document signed by the seller and relied upon by the buyer in accordance with this subsection, including, but not limited to, plats or surveys, creates an express warranty that the cooperative will conform to the description, subject to customary tolerances. (4) A provision that a buyer of a cooperative interest may put a unit which is part of that cooperative interest only to a specified use is an express warranty that the specified use is lawful. (b) Formal words unnecessary.-- Neither formal words, such as \"warranty\" or \"guarantee,\" nor a specific intention to make a warranty are necessary to create an express warranty of quality, but a statement purporting to be merely an opinion or commendation of the real estate or its value does not create a warranty. (c) Transfer of warranty.-- Any conveyance of a cooperative interest transfers to the purchaser all express warranties of quality made by previous sellers. (d) Limitation of actions.-- No action to enforce the warranty created by this section shall be commenced later than six years after the date of the writing which creates the warranty under subsection (a).",

      "text": "§ 4414. Implied warranty against structural defects. (a) Definition.-- As used in this section, \"structural defects\" means those defects in components constituting any unit or common element which reduce the stability or safety of the structure below accepted standards or restrict the normal intended use of all or part of the structure and which require repair, renovation, restoration or replacement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make the warrantor responsible for any items of maintenance relating to the units or common elements. (b) General rule.-- A declarant warrants against structural defects in each of the units for two years from the date each is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser and all of the common elements for two years. Any conveyance of a cooperative interest during the two-year warranty period shall be deemed to transfer to the purchaser all of the warranties created under this section. The two years shall begin as to each of the common elements whenever the common element has been completed or, if later: (1) as to any common element in real estate that may be added to the cooperative, at the time the first cooperative interest for a unit in such real estate is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; (2) as to any common element for which a development right to convert such common element to units or limited common elements has been reserved, at the time the first cooperative interest for a converted unit out of such common element is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; and (3) as to any common element within any other portion of the cooperative, at the time the first cooperative interest in the cooperative is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (c) Scope and applicability of warranties.-- A declarant of a cooperative containing one or more conversion buildings warrants: (1) against structural defects in components installed in each of the conversion buildings by the declarant or in work done or improvements made by the declarant in each of the conversion buildings; (2) that all units and common elements in each conversion building have been inspected for visible structural and mechanical defects and for other visible conditions that adversely affect the health or safety of residential occupants as required by section 4406(a)(1)(i) (relating to public offering statement; cooperatives containing conversion buildings), except that no such inspection is required of any unit the tenant or other lawful occupant of which does not permit such inspection to be conducted; and (3) that any such defects and other visible conditions found have been repaired. The warranties set forth in subsection (b) shall be applicable to any units and common elements that are located within a building containing or comprising one or more units that is not a conversion building. Otherwise, such declarant may offer the units, common elements or both in any conversion building in an \"as is\" condition. If any building containing or comprising units is a conversion building, then the warranty provisions of this subsection shall also apply to all common elements in the cooperative that are located outside of any conversion building and that are not located in a building containing one or more units that is not a conversion building. The declarant of a cooperative containing any conversion buildings may also give a more extensive warranty in writing. The times at which the warranties required by this subsection commence and the duration of such warranties shall be as provided in subsection (b). (d) Exclusion or modification of warranty.-- Except with respect to a purchaser of a unit for residential use, the warranty against structural defects: (1) may be excluded or modified by agreement of the parties; and (2) is excluded by expression of disclaimer, such as \"as is,\" \"with all faults\" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties. (e) Limitation of action.-- No action to enforce the warranty created by this section shall be commenced later than six years after the warranty begins, provided, however, that the limitation period affecting a right of action by the association under this section shall be six years after the warranty begins or two years after the unit owners elect an executive board under section 4303(f) (relating to executive board members and officers), whichever is later.

(c) Nonflexible planned communities.-- If a planned community created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains no more than 12 units and is not a flexible planned community, it is subject only to sections 5105, 5106, 5107 and 5218 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that planned community. (d) Amendments to declarations, bylaws, plats and plans.-- (1) In the case of amendments to the declaration, bylaws and plats and plans of any planned community created before the effective date of this subpart: (i) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made under this subpart. (ii) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made under this subpart. (2) An amendment to the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the document being amended. If any such amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this subpart, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in this subpart also apply to that person. (e) Nonresidential units.-- This subpart does not apply to a planned community in which all units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use unless the declaration provides that the subpart does apply to that planned community. This subpart applies to a planned community containing both units which are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use and other units which are not so restricted only if the declaration so provides or if the real estate comprising the units which may be used for residential purposes would be a planned community in the absence of the units which may not be used for residential purposes. (f) Planned communities outside Commonwealth.-- This subpart does not apply to planned communities or units located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions under sections 5402 (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) through 5405 (relating to public offering statement; planned community securities) shall apply to all contracts for the disposition thereof signed in this Commonwealth by any purchaser unless exempt under section 5401(b)(2) (relating to applicability; waiver).

Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, the unit's allocated votes and liabilities shall automatically be reallocated to the remaining units in proportion to the respective allocated votes and liabilities of those units before the taking. The association shall promptly prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Any remnant of a unit remaining after part of a unit is taken under this subsection shall be a common facility. (b) Acquisition of part of unit.-- Except as provided in subsection (a), if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain, the award shall compensate the unit owner for the reduction in value of the unit and its appurtenant interest in the planned community, whether or not any common facilities or controlled facilities are acquired, and shall compensate the association for the value, if any, of the interest of other units in any controlled facilities that were at the time of the taking a part of the unit subject to the taking. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, the following shall apply: (1) The unit's appurtenant votes in the association and common expense liability shall be reduced on the basis specified in the declaration with respect to the reallocation of votes and common expense liability in the event of eminent domain or, if the declaration does not specify a basis, as initially allocated based on the formulae stated in the declaration under section 5208 (relating to allocation of votes and common expense liabilities). (2) The portion of the appurtenant votes and common expense liability divested from the partially acquired unit shall be automatically reallocated to that unit and the remaining units in proportion to the respective appurtenant votes and liabilities of those units before the taking, with the partially acquired unit participating in the reallocation on the basis of its reduced allocated votes and liabilities. (c) Acquisition of part of common facilities.-- If part of the common facilities is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the award attributable to the interest of the association in the common facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining common facilities among the unit owners in proportion to the common expense liability attributable to the units before the taking, but any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common facility shall be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that limited common facility was allocated at the time of acquisition or in any manner as provided in the declaration. (d) Acquisition of part of controlled facilities.-- If, as part of a unit acquired by eminent domain, controlled facilities are taken which benefit other units, that portion of the award attributable to the interest of the other units in the controlled facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining controlled facilities equally among the unit owners whose units were benefited by the controlled facilities that have been taken.

(a) Recording lease and contents of declaration.-- A lease the expiration or termination of which may terminate the planned community or reduce its size shall be recorded in the same county where the declaration is recorded under section 5201 (relating to creation of planned community). Every lessor of those leases shall execute the declaration, and the declaration shall state the following: (1) The recording data for the lease. (2) The date on which the lease is scheduled to expire. (3) A legally sufficient description of the real estate subject to the lease. (4) Any right of the unit owners to redeem the reversion and the manner whereby those rights may be exercised or a statement that they do not have those rights. (5) Any right of the unit owners to remove any improvements after the expiration or termination of the lease or a statement that the unit owners do not have those rights. (6) Any rights of the unit owners to renew the lease and the conditions of any renewal or a statement that the unit owners do not have those rights. (b) Limitations on termination of leasehold interest.-- After the declaration for a leasehold planned community is recorded, neither the lessor nor a successor in interest may terminate the leasehold interest of a unit owner who makes timely payment of the owner's share of the rent and otherwise complies with all covenants which, if violated, would entitle the lessor to terminate the lease. A unit owner's leasehold interest is not affected by failure of any other person to pay rent or fulfill any other covenant. (c) Merger of leasehold and fee simple interests.-- Acquisition of the leasehold interest of any unit owner by the owner of the reversion or remainder does not merge the leasehold and fee simple interests unless the leasehold interests of all unit owners subject to that reversion or remainder are acquired. (d) Reallocation of interests if number of votes reduced.-- If the expiration or termination of a lease decreases the number of units in a planned community, the allocated votes in the association and common expense liabilities shall be reallocated in accordance with section 5107 (relating to eminent domain) as though those units had been taken by eminent domain. Reallocations shall be confirmed by an amendment to the declaration prepared, executed and recorded by the association. Cross References.

(a) General rule.-- The declaration shall allocate a fraction or percentage of the common expenses of the association and a portion of the votes in the association to each unit and state the formulas used to establish those allocations. Such formulas may take into account unusual attributes of identified units if the formulas state how the deviation from the normal rule applies to such units. (b) Flexible planned communities.-- If units may be added, including by conversion of convertible real estate to one or more units, to or withdrawn from the planned community, the declaration shall state the formulas to be used to reallocate the fractions, as percentages of the allocated share of the common expenses of the association and the percentages of votes in the association, among all units included in the planned community after the addition or withdrawal. (c) Votes.-- (1) Each unit shall be allocated one or more votes in the association. The declaration shall specify how votes in the association shall be allocated among the units and may provide: (i) for different allocations of votes among units on particular matters specified in the declaration; and (ii) for class voting on specified issues affecting a particular class of units if necessary to protect the valid interests of the owners of such units and not affecting units outside of the class. (2) Cumulative voting shall only be permitted if so provided expressly in the declaration and only for the purpose of electing members of the executive board. A declarant may not utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evading any limitation imposed on declarants by this subpart. The declaration may provide that different allocations of votes shall be made to the units in particular matters specified in the declaration. (d) Alteration or partition of allocations.-- Except as provided in section 5107 (relating to eminent domain), 5211 (relating to conversion and expansion of flexible planned communities), 5212 (relating to withdrawal of withdrawable real estate), 5214 (relating to relocation of boundaries between units) or 5215 (relating to subdivision or conversion of units), the votes and common expense liability allocated to any unit may not be changed without the consent of all unit owners whose allocated votes and common expense liabilities are changed. The common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which it is allocated is void. (e) Calculations for undivided interests.-- Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the common expense liabilities allocated at any time to all the units must equal one if stated as a fraction or 100% if stated as percentages. If there is a discrepancy between the allocated common expense liability and the result derived from application of the formulas, the allocated common expense liability prevails. Cross References.

(c) Recording amendment.-- The following shall apply: (1) Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in every county in which any portion of the planned community is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the planned community in both the grantor and grantee index. An amendment is effective only upon recording. (2) Except for counties which do not maintain a uniform parcel identifier number system of indexing, all counties shall assign a master parcel number to each planned community, and every amendment to the declaration shall be indexed against the master parcel. If required by the county, an amendment may be indexed against a parcel assigned to each unit within the planned community, but no fees shall be charged to each unit unless the indexing against each parcel is requested by the declarant or association. (3) The provisions of this subsection shall control over any conflicting provisions in any other statute, regulation or ordinance. (d) When unanimous consent or declarant joinder required.-- (1) Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other provisions of this subpart, without unanimous consent of all unit owners affected, no amendment may create or increase special declarant rights, alter the terms or provisions governing the completion or conveyance or lease of common facilities or increase the number of units or change the boundaries of any unit, the common expense liability or voting strength in the association allocated to a unit or the uses to which any unit is restricted. In addition, no declaration provisions pursuant to which any special declarant rights have been reserved to a declarant shall be amended without the express written joinder of the declarant in such amendment.

      "text": "§ 5220. Termination of planned community. (a) Number of votes required.-- Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain in section 5107 (relating to eminent domain), a planned community may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least 80%, or such larger percentage specified in the declaration, of the votes in the association are allocated. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the planned community are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (b) Execution and recording agreement and ratifications.-- An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution or ratification of a termination agreement, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners who are owners of record as of the date preceding the date of recording of the termination agreement. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. The termination agreement shall become void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of the expiration of one year from the date it was first executed and ratified by a unit owner or such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the planned community is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the planned community in both the grantor and grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recording. (c) Sale of real estate.-- The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in the planned community. The contract is not binding until approved under subsections (a) and (b). If any real estate in the planned community is to be sold by the association following termination, title to that real estate upon termination vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (f). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the owner's unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this subpart or the declaration. (d) Nonsale upon termination.-- If the real estate constituting the planned community is not to be sold following termination, title to the common facilities and, in a planned community containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the planned community vest in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (f), and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the owner's unit. (e) Proceeds of sale.-- Following termination of the planned community, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units which were recorded, filed of public record or otherwise perfected before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination. (f) Respective interests of unit owners.-- The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (c), (d) and (e) are as follows: (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units and limited common elements immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements. (2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common expense liabilities immediately before the termination. (g) Effect of foreclosure or enforcement of lien.-- Except as provided in subsection (h), foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire planned community does not of itself terminate the planned community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the planned community does not of itself withdraw that portion from the planned community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the planned community, but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the planned community. (h) Exclusion from planned community upon foreclosure.-- If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the planned community has priority over the declaration and if the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the planned community. (i) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.-- In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the planned community other than a provision for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the planned community would otherwise be terminated, owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.

(2) Prevent the association or the executive board from commencing, intervening in or settling any litigation or proceeding or receiving and distributing any insurance proceeds except under section 5312 (relating to insurance).

(a) Applicability of section.-- If the declaration for a planned community provides that any of the powers described in section 5302 (relating to power of unit owners' association) with respect to the planned community are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association (a \"master association\") which exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more other planned communities or other incorporated or unincorporated associations, then, except as modified by this section, all provisions of this subpart applicable to unit owners' associations shall apply to any such master association insofar as its actions affect the planned community. (b) Powers.-- Unless a master association is acting in the capacity of an association described in section 5301 (relating to organization of unit owners' association) with respect to a planned community which is part of the master association, it may exercise with respect to the planned community only such powers set forth in section 5302 and only to the extent expressly permitted in the declaration which provides for the delegation of powers from its planned community association to the master association and accepted by the master association, as indicated in the provisions of the declaration or other organizational documents of the master association. (c) Liability of executive board members and officers.-- If the declaration of a planned community provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board have no liability for the acts or omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following delegation. The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the planned community association whose powers are delegated to the master association and the unit owners of the planned community on the same basis as officers and executive board members of the planned community immediately before such delegation of powers. (d) Rights and responsibilities of persons electing governing body.-- The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in sections 5302, 5303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 5309 (relating to quorums), 5310 (relating to voting; proxies) and 5320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association with respect to the exercise of powers elected pursuant to a planned community declaration to the master association, but apply only to those persons who elect the governing body of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this subpart. (e) Election of master association governing body.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5303(e) with respect to the election of the executive board by all unit owners after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 5301, the instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each planned community of the organizational documents of other associations, the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association, shall provide that the governing body of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways: (1) All unit owners of all planned communities and other properties subject to the master association elect all members of the governing body of the master association. (2) All members of the governing bodies of the planned community associations and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect all members of the master association governing body. (3) All unit owners of each planned community and other property owners' association subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (4) All members of the governing bodies of the planned communities and other property associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (e.1) Independent reviewer.-- The instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each planned community of the organizational documents of other associations, the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association, shall also provide that a vote by a unit owner in an election of the members of the master association governing body must be submitted by the unit owner to an independent reviewer who shall tally the results of the election and certify the results to the executive board and unit owner. In order to be eligible to vote in the election, a unit owner shall be in good standing with the association. The executive board shall present the official election results based on the certified election report from the independent reviewer at a meeting of the unit owners and shall enter the results in the meeting records. All votes by unit owners under this subsection shall be submitted to the independent reviewer in accordance with the approved methods of voting as provided under this subpart. This subsection shall only apply to a planned community with at least 500 units. If a planned community has less than 500 units, the master association may opt in to the requirements under this subsection by a vote of at least 51% of the votes collected from the unit owners in person, electronically or by absentee ballot which are in favor of the requirements under this subsection. (f) Delegation of responsibility and authority.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to a planned community upon any of the following: (1) A date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the planned community. (2) An event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that: (i) the event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the planned community; and (ii) a copy of such instrument has been sent to all unit owners. (3) The declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the planned community and that a copy of such instrument has been sent to the executive board and all unit owners. This paragraph shall be applicable only if the declarant shall have expressly reserved in the declaration, under section 5205(13) (relating to contents of declaration; all planned communities), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the planned community and only if the instrument exercising such right has been recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right. (g) Delegation of all powers.-- If all of the powers of a planned community association are delegated to a master association and accepted by the master association under subsection (b), then the governing body of the master association may act in all respects as the executive board of the planned community, and no separate executive board need be elected or exist.

The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service credit in that county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous county employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer, by the member, county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's county or municipal pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the county or municipal pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by December 31, 1987, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by December 31, 1987.

Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service in accordance with county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system benefit provisions, multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members. The Public Employee Retirement Study Commission shall determine the appropriate amount of employer contributions to be transferred to the system by the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems. (2) If the member died prior to the effective date of this subsection, the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1). In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by December 31, 1987. If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before January 1, 1988, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by March 31, 1988. If the member dies after December 31, 1987, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), neither the member or his estate shall receive credit for the prior service.

(2) The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service in the \"predecessor corporation\" transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, the provisions of section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer by the member or the \"predecessor corporation\" to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the member's pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by June 30, 1992, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the \"predecessor corporation\" pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by June 30, 1992. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall pay as pick-up contributions the difference between the amount credited to the member's account and the amount otherwise due under section 5504. Such additional contributions paid by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall not be considered compensation for the purposes of this part. If the amount transferred to the system by the member is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members so long as the amount to be transferred is equal to or less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee. In the event that the amount required to be transferred is greater than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee shall be transferred to the system, and the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system the additional funds needed to satisfy the requirements of the calculation in this paragraph. If the amount required to be transferred is less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority may retain the amount not needed for transfer. (3) If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before July 1, 1992, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or may request that the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by September 30, 1992. If the member dies after June 30, 1992, without making the transfer or without requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), neither the member nor his estate shall receive credit for the prior service.

(3) Contributions to be paid by an active member for credit for New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be sufficient to provide an amount equal to the regular and additional accumulated deductions which would have been standing to the credit of the member for such service had regular and additional member contributions been made to the board with full coverage as a Class A member during the period of New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and had these regular and additional accumulated deductions been credited with statutory interest up to the date of purchase.

(b) Other provisions.-- Subject to the provisions of the declaration, the bylaws may provide for any other matters the association deems necessary and appropriate. (c) Corrective amendments.-- Except as otherwise provided in the bylaws or code of regulations, if any amendment to the bylaws or code of regulations is necessary in the judgment of the executive board to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision of the bylaws or code of regulations that is defective, missing or inconsistent with any other provision thereof, with the declaration or with this subpart or if an amendment is necessary in the judgment of the executive board to conform to the requirements of any agency or entity that has established national or regional standards with respect to loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on units in planned communities or so-called \"PUD projects,\" cooperative projects (such as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), to comply with any statute, regulation, code or ordinance which may now or hereafter be made applicable to the planned community or association, or to make a reasonable accommodation or permit a reasonable modification in favor of handicapped, as may be defined by prevailing Federal or State laws or regulations applicable to the association, unit owners, residents, tenants or employees, then, at any time and from time to time, the executive board may at its discretion effect an appropriate corrective amendment without the approval of the unit owners or the holders of any liens on all or any part of the planned community or association, upon receipt by the executive board of an opinion from legal counsel who is independent from the declarant to the effect that the proposed amendment is permitted by the terms of this subsection.

(a) General rule.-- (1) An action in tort alleging a wrong done by a declarant or his agent or employee in connection with a portion of any convertible or withdrawable real estate or other portion of the planned community which the declarant has the responsibility to maintain may not be brought against the association or against a unit owner other than a declarant. (2) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (1): (i) An action in tort alleging a wrong done by the association or by an agent or employee of the association, or on behalf of the association, must be brought against the association. (ii) A unit owner shall not be subject to suit or, except as otherwise provided by subsection (b), be otherwise directly or indirectly held accountable for the acts of the association or its agents or employees on behalf of the association. (3) If the tort or breach of contract occurred during any period of declarant control under section 5303(c) (relating to executive board members and officers), the declarant is liable to the association for all unreimbursed losses suffered by the association as a result of that tort or breach of contract, including costs and reasonable attorney fees. If a claim for a tort or breach of contract is made after the period of declarant control, the association shall have no right against the declarant under this paragraph unless the association shall have given the declarant all of the following: (i) Notice of the existence of the claim promptly after the date on which a member of the executive board who is not a designee of the declarant learns of the existence of the claim. (ii) An opportunity to defend against the claim on behalf of the association but at the declarant's expense. (4) A unit owner is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this subsection because he is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association.

(b) Lien of judgment.-- Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a judgment for money against the association if and when entered of record against the name of the association in the office of the clerk of the court of common pleas of the county where the planned community is located shall also constitute a lien against each unit for a pro rata share of the amount of that judgment, including interest thereon, based on the common expense liability allocated to that unit under section 5208 (relating to allocation of votes and common expense liabilities).

      "text": "§ 5312. Insurance. (a) Insurance to be carried by association.-- Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available, all of the following: (1) Property insurance on the common facilities and controlled facilities to the extent the controlled facilities can be insured separately from the unit and, if insurance for the unit is not provided by the association under subsection (b) or the declaration, insuring against all common risks of direct physical loss. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies. (2) Comprehensive general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage, arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements. (3) Any property or comprehensive general liability insurance carried by the association may contain a deductible provision. (b) Units having horizontal boundaries.-- In the case of a building containing units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, that insurance described in subsection (a)(1), to the extent reasonably available, shall include the units but need not include improvements and betterments installed by unit owners. (c) Other insurance carried by association.-- If the insurance described in subsections (a) and (b) is not maintained, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to all unit owners. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance. The association may carry any other insurance in such reasonable amounts and with such reasonable deductibles as the executive board may deem appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners. (d) Policy terms.-- Insurance policies carried under subsections (a) and (b) shall provide all of the following: (1) Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his membership in the association. (2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or member of the owner's household. (3) No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy. (4) If at the time of a loss under the policy there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy is primary insurance not contributing with the other insurance. (e) Proceeds from property insurance.-- Any loss covered by the property policy under subsections (a)(1) and (b) shall be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss shall be payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (h), the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged common elements and units, and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the common elements and units have been completely repaired or restored or the planned community is terminated. (f) Unit owner insurance.-- A unit owner may insure his unit for all losses to his unit, including losses not covered by the insurance maintained by the association due to a deductible provision or otherwise. A residential unit owner shall insure the owner's unit except as insurance is provided by the association in accordance with this section or the declaration. An insurance policy issued to the association shall not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the owner's own benefit, including, but not limited to, insurance to cover any deductibles or losses not covered by the association's property or comprehensive general liability insurance. (g) Evidence and cancellation of insurance.-- An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon request, to any unit owner, mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance may not be canceled until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued. (h) Disposition of insurance proceeds.-- (1) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the association by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless: (i) the planned community is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. Except for the costs of repair or replacement which are not covered due to deductibles, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves, which have not been identified by the executive board to fund costs of capital expenditures budgeted for the current fiscal year of the association, is a common expense. (2) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the unit owner by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the unit owner unless: (i) the planned community is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote to not rebuild. The cost of repair or replacement of these portions in excess of insurance proceeds is the unit owner's expense. (3) If the entire planned community is not repaired or replaced, the following apply: (i) The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the planned community. (ii) The insurance proceeds attributable to units shall be paid to unit owners except those proceeds attributable to controlled facilities for which insurance is separately maintained by the association under this section or the declaration shall be distributed to all unit owners in proportion to their common expense liability. Proceeds attributable to limited common facilities which are not rebuilt shall be distributed equally to owners of units to which those limited common facilities were assigned. (iii) The remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners in proportion to their common expense liability. (4) If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's votes in the association and common expense liability are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under section 5107(a) (relating to eminent domain), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, section 5220 (relating to termination of planned community) governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the planned community is terminated. (i) Nonresidential planned communities.-- The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a planned community all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use. (j) Recovery of deductibles.-- If any insurance policy maintained by the association contains a deductible, then that portion of any loss or claim which is not covered by insurance due to the application of a deductible, as well as any claim or loss for which the association is self-insured, shall be levied by the executive board in accordance with section 5314(c) (relating to assessments for common expenses).

The budgets of the association shall segregate limited common expenses from general common expenses if and to the extent appropriate.

(c) Special allocations of expenses.-- Except as provided by the declaration: (1) Any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair or replacement of a limited common element shall be assessed in equal shares against the units to which that limited common element was assigned at the time the expense was incurred. (2) Any common expense benefiting fewer than all of the units shall be assessed exclusively against the units benefited.

(a) General rule.-- The association has a lien on a unit for any assessment levied against that unit or fines imposed against its unit owner from the time the assessment or fine becomes due. The association's lien may be foreclosed in a like manner as a mortgage on real estate. A judicial or other sale of the unit in execution of a common element lien or any other lien shall not affect the lien of a mortgage on the unit, except the mortgage for which the sale is being held, if the mortgage is prior to all other liens upon the same property except those liens identified in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8152(a) (relating to judicial sale as affecting lien of mortgage) and liens for planned community assessments created under this section. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines and interest charged under section 5302(a)(10), (11) and (12) (relating to power of unit owners' association) and reasonable costs and expenses of the association, including legal fees, incurred in connection with collection of any sums due to the association by the unit owner or enforcement of the provisions of the declaration, bylaws, rules or regulations against the unit owner are enforceable as assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in installments and one or more installments are not paid when due, the entire outstanding balance of the assessment becomes effective as a lien from the due date of the delinquent installment. (b) Priority of lien.-- (1) General rule.-- A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except: (i) Liens and encumbrances recorded before the recording of the declaration. (ii) (A) Mortgages and deeds of trust on the unit securing first mortgage holders and recorded before due date of the assessment if the assessment is not payable in installments or the due date of the unpaid installment if the assessment is payable in installments. (B) Judgments obtained for obligations secured by any such mortgage or deed of trust under clause (A). (iii) Liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit. (2) Limited nondivestiture.-- The association's lien for assessments shall be divested by a judicial sale of the unit: (i) As to unpaid common expense assessments made under section 5314(b) (relating to assessments for common expenses) that come due during the six months immediately preceding the date of a judicial sale of a unit in an action to enforce collection of a lien against a unit by a judicial sale, only to the extent that the six months' unpaid assessments are paid out of the proceeds of the sale. (ii) As to unpaid common expense assessments made under section 5314(b) other than the six months' assessment referred to in subparagraph (i), in a full amount of the unpaid assessments, whether or not the proceeds of the judicial sale are adequate to pay these assessments. To the extent that the proceeds of the sale are sufficient to pay some or all of these additional assessments after satisfaction in full of the costs of the judicial sale and the liens and encumbrances of the types described in paragraph (1) and the unpaid common expense assessments that come due during the six-month period described in subparagraph (i), the assessments shall be paid before any remaining proceeds may be paid to any other claimant, including the prior owner of the unit. (3) Monetary exemption.-- The lien is not subject to the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8123 (relating to general monetary exemption). (c) Liens having equal priority.-- If the association and one or more associations, condominium associations or cooperative associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same real estate, those liens have equal priority. (d) Notice and perfection of lien.-- Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. (e) Limitation of actions.-- A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien or actions or suits to recover sums for which subsection (a) establishes a lien are instituted within four years after the assessments become payable. (f) Other remedies preserved.-- Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit actions or suits to recover sums for which subsection (a) creates a lien or to prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure. (g) Costs and attorney fees.-- A judgment or decree in any action or suit brought under this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney fees for the prevailing party. (h) Statement of unpaid assessments.-- The association shall furnish to a unit owner upon written request a recordable statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments currently levied against his unit and any credits of surplus in favor of his unit under section 5313 (relating to surplus funds). The statement shall be furnished within ten business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive board and every unit owner. (i) Application of payments.-- Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any payment received by an association in connection with the lien under this section shall be applied first to any interest accrued by the association, then to any late fee, then to any costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the association in collection or enforcement and then to the delinquent assessment. The foregoing shall be applicable notwithstanding any restrictive endorsement, designation or instructions placed on or accompanying a payment.

(a) General rule.-- Portions of the common facilities may be conveyed or subjected to a security interest by the association if the persons entitled to cast at least 80% of the votes in the association, including 80% of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies agree to that action; but the owners of units to which any limited common facility is allocated must agree in order to convey that limited common facility or subject it to a security interest. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association. (b) Required agreement.-- An agreement to convey common facilities or subject them to a security interest shall be evidenced by the execution of an agreement or ratifications of the agreement, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date. The agreement and all ratifications shall be recorded in every county in which a portion of the planned community is situated and is effective only upon recording. (c) Association powers.-- The association on behalf of the unit owners may contract to convey common facilities or subject them to a security interest, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved under subsections (a) and (b). Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance, including the power to execute deeds or other instruments. (d) Other conveyances or encumbrances void.-- Any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, tax sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of common facilities, unless made pursuant to this section, is void. (e) Right of access and support.-- A conveyance or encumbrance of common facilities pursuant to this section does not deprive any unit of its right of access and support. (f) Preexisting encumbrances.-- Unless the declaration otherwise provides, a conveyance or encumbrance of common facilities pursuant to this section does not affect the priority or validity of preexisting encumbrances. (g) Limitation.-- Common facilities which may be conveyed or encumbered pursuant to this section shall not include any land, buildings or other facilities: (1) containing or comprising one or more units; or (2) necessary for the use or operation of one or more units. (h) Subject to declaration.-- An interest in common facilities that is subject to the declaration prior to conveyance or encumbrance shall remain subject to the provisions of the declaration following the conveyance or encumbrance, unless the deed or agreement to convey the common facilities or subject them to a security interest specifically provides otherwise.

No other property of a unit owner is subject to the claims of creditors of the association. (b) Security interest in common facilities.-- If the association has granted a security interest in the common facilities to a creditor of the association under section 5318 (relating to conveyance or encumbrance of common facilities), the holder of that security interest shall exercise its right against the common facilities before its judgment lien on any unit may be enforced. (c) Release upon payment of unit owner's share.-- Whether perfected before or after the creation of the planned community, if a lien other than a deed of trust or mortgage, including a judgment lien or lien attributable to work performed or materials supplied before creation of the planned community, becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the amount of the lien attributable to his unit; and the lienholder, upon receipt of payment, promptly shall deliver a release of the lien covering that unit. The amount of the payment shall be proportionate to the ratio which that unit owner's common expense liability bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the lien. After payment, the association may not assess or have a lien against that unit owner's unit for any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with that lien. (d) Indexing of judgments.-- A judgment against the association shall be indexed in the name of the planned community and the association and, when so indexed, is notice of the lien against the units.

(a) General rule.-- Any deposit (which shall not include any installment payment under an installment sales contract nor a payment specifically stated in a sales contract to be in payment of or on account of extras, changes or custom work) made in connection with the purchase or reservation of a unit from a declarant shall be placed in escrow and held in this Commonwealth by a licensed real estate broker, an attorney admitted to practice in this Commonwealth, a financial institution or a licensed title insurance company in an account or in the form of a certificate of deposit designated solely for that purpose with a financial institution whose accounts are insured by a governmental agency or instrumentality until: (1) delivered to the declarant at closing or, in the case of the sale of a unit pursuant to an installment sales contract, upon the expiration of 30 days from the date of occupancy of the unit; (2) delivered to the declarant because of purchaser's default under a contract to purchase the unit; or (3) refunded to the purchaser. (b) Use of bond or letter of credit.-- In lieu of escrowing deposits in accordance with subsection (a), a declarant may: (1) obtain and maintain a corporate surety bond issued by a surety authorized to do business in this Commonwealth, and in which the declarant has no direct or indirect ownership interest, in the form and in the amount set forth in subsection (d); or (2) obtain and maintain an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a financial institution whose accounts are insured by a governmental agency or instrumentality, and in which the declarant has no direct or indirect ownership interest, in the form and in the amount set forth in subsection (d).

(d) Form and amount of bond or letter of credit.-- (1) A bond obtained pursuant to subsection (b)(1) shall be payable to the Commonwealth for use and benefit of every person protected by the provisions of this section.

      "text": "§ 5410. Planned communities containing conversion buildings. (a) Notice of conversion.-- The declarant of every planned community containing one or more conversion buildings shall give each of the residential tenants and residential subtenants, if any, lawfully in possession of a unit or units in a conversion building or buildings a conversion notice no later than one year before the declarant requires the residential tenant and residential subtenant to vacate. The conversion notice must set forth generally the rights of residential tenants and residential subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the residential tenant and residential subtenant at the address of the unit and not more than one other mailing address provided by the residential tenant. Every notice shall be accompanied by a public offering statement concerning the proposed sale of planned community units within such building or buildings. Except as provided in subsection (f), no residential tenant or residential subtenant in a conversion building may be required by the declarant to vacate the unit earlier than one year after the conversion notice date except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy, including those terms that apply to a period occurring in whole or in part after the conversion notice date, may not be altered but may be enforced during that period. Failure of a declarant to give notice to a residential tenant or residential subtenant entitled to such notice under this subsection is a defense to an action for possession against such residential tenant or residential subtenant. (b) Offer to tenant to purchase unit.-- For six months after the conversion notice date, the declarant shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use in a conversion building to the tenant who leases that unit. If the tenant fails to purchase his unit during that six-month period, the declarant may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following six months at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection shall not apply to any rental unit: (1) which, immediately prior to the conversion notice date, was restricted or devoted exclusively to nonresidential use; or (2) the boundaries of which, after the creation of the planned community, will not substantially conform to the boundaries of such unit on the conversion notice date. (c) Effect of wrongful conveyance.-- If a declarant, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, recording of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that unit if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection (b) but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of subsection (b). (d) Notice to vacate.-- If a conversion notice specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, the conversion notice also constitutes a notice of termination of the tenant's lease, subject to revocation in accordance with subsection (i), and a notice to quit specified by section 501 of the act of April 6, 1951 (P.L.69, No.20), known as The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951. (e) Improper lease termination prohibited.-- (1) Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms. (2) Nothing in this section or in any lease shall prohibit a residential tenant, after receiving notice under subsection (a), from terminating any lease without any liability for such termination provided such tenant gives the building owner 90 days' written notice of the intent to terminate the lease. (3) The declarant or owner of any proposed conversion planned community shall not engage in any activity of any nature which would coerce the tenant into terminating any lease, including, but not limited to, harassing tenants or withholding normal services or repairs. (f) Units leased to senior citizens and disabled persons.-- (1) For the purpose of this subsection, an eligible tenant or subtenant shall be a natural person who, on the conversion notice date, lawfully occupies a unit in a conversion building as a principal residence and is 62 years of age or older or is disabled and has occupied the unit for at least two years. For purposes of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to be disabled if on the conversion notice date he is totally and permanently unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impediment, including, but not limited to, blindness. (2) Within 60 days after the conversion notice date, any tenant or subtenant in possession of a unit who believes that he is an eligible tenant or subtenant shall so notify the declarant and shall provide the declarant with proof of his eligibility. Any eligible tenant or subtenant who has established his eligibility as aforesaid shall be entitled to remain in possession of his unit for two years following the conversion notice date, notwithstanding any prior termination date in his lease, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other occupants' peaceful enjoyment of the planned community, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a time period after the conversion notice date, may not be altered but may be enforced during the time period between the original lease termination date and the expiration of this two-year period except as is otherwise provided in paragraph (3). (3) The monthly rental payable by the tenant during the time period commencing upon the later to occur of the original lease termination date or the first anniversary of the conversion notice date and ending upon the expiration of the two-year period described in paragraph (2) shall be the same monthly rental as was payable for the month immediately preceding the original lease termination date, except that, at the landlord's option, such monthly rental may be increased by the lesser of 5% of such monthly rental or the same percentage increase as the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor for the six-month time period commencing on the first day of the first full calendar month after the conversion notice date. (4) Failure of a declarant to comply with the provisions of this subsection is a defense to an action for possession. (g) Tenant meetings; open to the public.-- With respect to any conversion building containing one or more units then occupied for residential use, at least 30 days before the conversion notice date, the declarant shall hold a tenant meeting open to the public in the municipality where the proposed conversion building is located at a place and time convenient to the persons who may be directly affected by the conversion. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given to residential tenants and subtenants in lawful possession of their units, in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice, and to the general public by a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the planned community is located, except that no notice to the general public need be given with respect to conversion buildings as to which the provisions of section 5402(b) (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) are applicable. At such meeting, representatives of the declarant shall briefly describe the following and may, but shall not be required to, discuss other matters: (1) The rights and obligations of tenants and subtenants under this section. (2) Improvements, if any, then planned to be made to the planned community by the declarant. (3) The anticipated approximate range of initial unit sales prices. Specific unit sales prices need not, however, be provided. (4) The anticipated approximate range of estimated monthly common expenses for various types of units; however, specific per unit estimates need not be provided. (h) Community development grants.-- If Federal funds under the Community Economic Development Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35, 42 U.S.C. § 9801 et seq.) have been used to finance the rehabilitation of multifamily rental housing, with the intent that such housing subsequent to the rehabilitation is to be used for residential rental purposes, such housing shall not be converted to a planned community for a period of ten years from the date the rehabilitation is completed. (i) Revocation.-- A declarant may subsequently revoke a conversion notice if the declarant has expressly reserved the right of revocation in the conversion notice and if the notice of revocation: (1) Is given prior to the conveyance of any unit in the planned community occurring after the conversion notice date other than a unit or units conveyed to a successor declarant or as a result of foreclosure of a mortgage on the unit or a deed in lieu thereof. (2) Is given in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice. (3) Is given to all persons who were entitled to receive the conversion notice and who continue to be in lawful occupancy at the time such notice of revocation is given. The giving of a notice of revocation revokes all rights granted under this section but does not revoke the rights granted to residential tenants under subsection (a) or (f), and such rights shall be deemed to have been incorporated in each residential tenant's lease. (j) Waiver of purchase rights.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this subpart prohibiting waiver of rights, any tenant may waive his right to purchase a unit under subsection (b) if the waiver is in writing, is acknowledged and is given in consideration of: (1) an extension of the term of the tenant's tenancy and right of occupancy under this subpart beyond the time period required by subsections (a) and (f) as applicable; (2) the tenant entering into an agreement to purchase another unit in the planned community; or (3) all occupants of the unit making alternative living arrangements. (k) Alteration of terms of tenancy.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (a) or (f), the terms of the tenancy of a tenant or subtenant may be altered with the express written consent of that tenant or subtenant, and such altered terms shall then be the terms of tenancy referred to in this section. (l) Application of section.-- The provisions of this section shall apply only with respect to conversion buildings in which one or more residential tenants or residential subtenants are in lawful occupancy on the conversion notice date, and the only tenants who are entitled to exercise the rights granted under this section are residential tenants or residential subtenants: (1) who are in lawful occupancy of conversion building on the date the declarant gives the conversion notice; or (2) who commence their tenancy after the notice of conversion is given to the other residential tenants without having been notified in writing, at or prior to the commencement of their tenancy, that the property is then a planned community and that they are not entitled to the rights granted under this section. Such rights continue only so long as the lawful occupancy of the tenant or subtenant continues. (Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1486, No.189, eff. 60 days) 2004 Amendment. Act 189 amended subsecs.

(a) Scope.-- Nothing in this section shall be construed to make the declarant responsible for any items of maintenance relating to the units or common elements. (b) General rule.-- (1) A declarant warrants against structural defects in structures constructed, modified, altered or improved by or on behalf of such declarant in: (i) each of the units and the controlled facilities that are part of a unit for two years from the date each unit is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; and (ii) all of the controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and all common facilities for two years except facilities which have been dedicated to a municipality, municipal authority or other governmental unit. (2) Only the association may bring an action for breach of warranty with respect to common facilities and the controlled facilities that are not part of a unit. An action for breach of warranty with respect to one or more units or controlled facilities that are a part of a unit may be brought either by the association or an owner of an affected unit. Any conveyance of a unit during the two-year warranty period shall be deemed to transfer to the purchaser all of the declarant's warranties created under this section. The two years shall begin, as to each of the controlled facilities that are not part of a unit, whenever the controlled facilities that are not part of the unit have been completed and, as to each common facility, whenever such common facilities have been completed or, if later: (i) As to any controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and as to common facilities within any additional real estate or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (ii) As to any controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and as to common facilities within any convertible real estate or portion thereof, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (iii) As to any controlled facilities that are not part of a unit and as to common facilities within any other portion of the planned community, at the time the first unit therein is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (c) Planned communities containing conversion buildings.-- A declarant of a planned community containing one or more conversion building warrants as follows: (1) That there are no structural defects in components installed anywhere in the planned community or in work done or improvements made by or on behalf of the declarant anywhere in the planned community. (2) That all units and common elements in each conversion building have been inspected for visible structural and mechanical defects and for other visible conditions that adversely affect the health or safety of residential occupants, as required by section 5404(a)(1) (relating to public offering statement; planned communities containing conversion buildings), except no such inspection is required of any unit if the tenant or other lawful occupant of the unit does not permit such inspection to be conducted. (3) That any defects and other visible conditions found have been repaired. The warranties under subsection (b) shall be applicable to any units and common elements that are located within a building that contains or comprises one or more units and is not a conversion building. Otherwise, the declarant may offer the units, common elements or both in an \"as is\" condition. The declarant of a planned community containing any conversion buildings may also give a more extensive warranty in writing. The times at which the warranties required by this subsection commence and the duration of such warranties shall be as provided in subsection (b). (d) Exclusion or modification of warranty.-- Except with respect to a purchaser of a unit for residential use, the warranty against structural defects: (1) May be excluded or modified by agreement of the parties. (2) Is excluded by expression of disclaimer, such as \"as is,\" \"with all faults\" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties. (e) Limitation of actions.-- No action to enforce the warranty created by this section shall be commenced later than six years after the warranty begins, provided, however, that the limitation period affecting a right of action by the association under this section shall be six years after the warranty begins or two years after the unit owners elect an executive board under section 5303(e) (relating to executive board members and officers), whichever is later. (f) Disclaimer of implied warranties.-- To the extent permitted by applicable law, a declarant may disclaim implied warranties applicable to any unit or common elements to which the warranty provided by this section applies, provided such disclaimer is set forth in the contract for the sale of a unit and in the public offering statement for the planned community of which the unit or common element is a part. The disclaimer required under this subsection shall be set forth in 14-point boldface type. (Mar. 24, 1998, P.L.206, No.37, eff. 60 days; Oct. 19, 2018, P.L.551, No.84, eff. 60 days) 2018 Amendment.

(b) Procedure.-- (1) If it is made to appear, by affidavits or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court that a violation exists, a temporary writ of injunction shall forthwith issue, directed to the operator of the adult entertainment establishment or the owner of the premises, or both, restraining the operator or owner from continuing or permitting the continuation of any violation or violations of this chapter until the conclusion of the hearing and a decision by the court. No bond shall be required in instituting such proceedings. This chapter, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity. (2) It shall not be necessary for the court to find the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but, on finding that the material allegations of the petition are true, the court shall order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises be used in violation of this chapter. Upon judgment of the court ordering the violations to be abated, the court may order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises shall be occupied or used for any purpose for up to one year following the date of the court's order, but the court may, in its discretion, permit the premises to be occupied or used by the operator or owner if the operator or owner, or both, posts a bond or a joint bond in the discretion of the court with sufficient surety to be approved by the court in the penal and liquidated sum of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and conditioned that neither the building nor a part of the building be used in violation of this chapter and that the operator will pay all fines, costs and damages that may be assessed for any violation of this chapter upon the premises. (3) Service of any preliminary or permanent injunction shall be made personally upon the operator and owner of the premises if such persons can be found in the county. If the operator or owner cannot be found, a copy of the order shall be delivered to any employee of the operator on the establishment premises or, in the case of the owner, upon an agent, if any. If no employee or agent can be found or service cannot be made on an employee or agent of the owner, then service shall be made as the court may direct. Any person other than the operator or owner who shall be served with any notice of an injunction shall within 24 hours thereafter deliver the notice to the operator or owner, as the case may be, or mail it to the operator or owner by registered mail if the address of the operator or owner, as the case may be, is known to the person served. Suspension by Court Order. Subsec. (b)(1) was suspended July 31, 1997, S.Ct. Order, to the extent that section 5506(b)(1) provides that Chapter 55, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity.",

      "text": "§ 5508. Actuarial cost method. (a) Employer contribution rate on behalf of active members.-- For each fiscal year, the amount of the Commonwealth and other employer contributions on behalf of all active members shall be computed by the actuary as a percentage of the total compensation of all active members during the period for which the amount is determined and shall be so certified by the board. The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall consist of the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b), and the accrued liability contribution rate as defined in subsection (c). The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall be modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in subsection (f). (b) Employer normal contribution rate.-- The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined after each actuarial valuation on the basis of an annual interest rate and such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the board in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined as follows: (1) From the effective date of this paragraph through fiscal year 2021-2022, as a level percentage of the compensation of the average new active member, which percentage, if contributed on the basis of his prospective compensation through his entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to him in excess of that portion funded by his prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (2) For fiscal year 2022-2023 and each fiscal year thereafter, as a level percentage of the compensation of all active members, which percentage, if contributed from the start of their employment on the basis of their prospective compensation through their entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to them in excess of that portion funded by their prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (c) Accrued liability contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2003, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits, except for the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708 (relating to supplemental annuities), 5708.1 (relating to additional supplemental annuities), 5708.2 (relating to further additional supplemental annuities), 5708.3 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1994), 5708.4 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment), 5708.5 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1998), 5708.6 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2002), 5708.7 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2003) and 5708.8 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002), in excess of the total assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all investment gains and losses over a five-year period), excluding the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members on December 31, 2001, and excluding contributions to be transferred by county retirement systems or pension plans pursuant to section 5507(c) (relating to contributions to the system by the Commonwealth and other employers). The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002, except that, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2002, but before July 1, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded over a period of ten years from the first day of July, coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution for such additional legislative liabilities shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the first annual payment. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, the outstanding balance of the increase in accrued liability due to the change in benefits enacted in 2001 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2002, and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in calendar year 2002 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2003. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2003, but before January 1, 2009, such additional liability shall be funded in equal dollar annual contributions over a period of ten years from the first day of July coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. (3) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund in equal dollar installments over a period of 30 years from July 1, 2010, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits calculated as of the immediately prior valuation date, including the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8, but excluding the benefits payable from the retirement benefit plan established pursuant to section 5941 (relating to benefits completion plan), in excess of the actuarially calculated assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses each year in level annual installments over five years), including the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer will receive for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members, inactive members on leave without pay, vestees and special vestees on December 31, 2009. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (4) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as provided for under this section, except that the rate shall be computed as a rate of total compensation of all active members and active participants for the applicable period and the accrued liability shall be determined and the rate shall be computed without regard to the portion of any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h) for which an annual setoff has not been credited or recognized in a prior fiscal year. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2016, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. In addition to any employer defined contributions made to the trust, the Commonwealth and other employers of participants shall make the accrued liability contributions to the fund certified by the board. (d) Special provisions on calculating contributions.-- In calculating the contributions required by subsections (a), (b) and (c), the active members of Class C shall be considered to be members of Class A. In addition, the actuary shall determine the Commonwealth or other employer contributions required for active members of Class C and officers of the Pennsylvania State Police and enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board who are members of Class A to finance their benefits in excess of those to which other members of Class A are entitled. Such additional contributions shall be determined separately for officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police and for enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. Such contributions payable on behalf of officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police shall include the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of May 12, 1943 (P.L.259, No.120), referred to as the Foreign Casualty Insurance Premium Tax Allocation Law, and on behalf of enforcement officers or investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of April 12, 1951 (P.L.90, No.21), known as the Liquor Code. (e) Supplemental annuity contribution rate.-- (1) For the period July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4 and 5708.5 shall be paid over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002. The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2002 provided for in section 5708.6 shall be as provided in section 5708.6(f). The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2003 provided for in section 5708.7 shall be as provided in section 5708.7(f). The funding for the special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002 under section 5708.8 shall be as provided in section 5708.8(g). The amount of each annual supplemental annuities contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002. (2) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8 shall be paid as part of the accrued liability contribution rate as provided for in subsection (c)(3), and there shall not be a separate supplemental annuity contribution rate attributable to those supplemental annuities. In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (f) Experience adjustment factor.-- (1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability and any increase or decrease in the liabilities and funding for supplemental annuities, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience (recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses over a five-year period), changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, State employees making shared-risk member contributions or having shared-gain adjustments to their regular member contributions, payment of additional accrued liability contributions under section 5507(g), changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of 30 years beginning with the July 1 succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases. The experience adjustment factor calculated under this paragraph shall be determined without regard to any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h). (2) The actuarially required contribution rate shall be the sum of the normal contribution rate, the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate, modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in paragraph (1). (g) Determination of liability for special vestee.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or other law, the total additional accrued actuarial liability resulting from eligibility of special vestees for benefits upon the attainment of superannuation age shall be determined by the actuary as part of the first annual valuation made after June 30, 1997. The resulting additional accrued actuarial liability shall be paid by The Pennsylvania State University to the board in one lump sum payment within 90 days of the board's certification of the amount to The Pennsylvania State University. (h) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.-- The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation to the prior year's final contribution rate. If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by the respective percentage above of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all subsequent fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not apply. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of total compensation of all active members. (i) Final contribution rate.-- For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate shall be 5% of total compensation of all active members. For each subsequent fiscal year for which the collared contribution rate is applicable, the final contribution rate shall be the collared contribution rate plus the costs added by legislation. For all other fiscal years, the final contribution rate shall be the actuarially required contribution rate, provided that the final contribution rate shall not be less than the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b).

(a) Broadband facilities.-- The following apply: (1) An electric cooperative corporation or an affiliate of an electric cooperative corporation may provide broadband services or construct, operate and maintain broadband facilities through an existing easement owned, held or used by the electric cooperative corporation. An electric cooperative corporation may only supply retail broadband services through one or more affiliates. (2) Except as provided for under subsection (b), the attachment of broadband facilities shall not constitute a change to the physical use of the easement, interfere with or impair any vested rights of the property owner subject to the easement or place an additional burden on the property or interests of the owner. (3) A broadband service supplier that is not an electric cooperative corporation may access and attach broadband facilities within an electric cooperative corporation's easement: (i) if an electric cooperative corporation or its affiliates have attached broadband facilities to provide retail or wholesale broadband services or if an electric cooperative corporation, in its sole discretion, gives express written permission to a broadband service supplier to utilize an existing electric easement; and (ii) subject to the terms of applicable safety standards, the structural integrity of the electric infrastructure and the electric cooperative corporation's rules and fees for the attachments. (4) An electric cooperative corporation that elects to provide retail broadband services, through an affiliate, as a broadband service supplier shall permit other suppliers of such services nondiscriminatory access to attach to electric infrastructure, owned or controlled by the electric cooperative corporation, pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions comparable to and no less favorable than those offered to an affiliate of an electric cooperative corporation engaged in the provision of retail broadband services. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit, amend, supersede or otherwise alter the rates, terms and conditions established under existing written attachment agreements for the term of such agreements except as provided under subparagraph (iii). The following shall apply: (i) Except as provided under subparagraph (ii), an electric cooperative corporation shall provide written notice, by first class mail, to any broadband service supplier with which it has an existing written agreement governing the broadband service supplier's attachments to electric infrastructure owned or controlled by the electric cooperative corporation within 90 days of the date on which an electric cooperative corporation's affiliate begins offering retail broadband services over broadband facilities. (ii) An electric cooperative corporation that is providing retail broadband service through an affiliate as of the effective date of this section shall not be required to send the notice required under subparagraph (i). (iii) For a period of five years from receipt of the notice required under subparagraph (i), or from the effective date of this section if subparagraph (ii) applies, a broadband service supplier that has an existing written attachment agreement with an electric cooperative corporation shall have the right to attach to the poles of that electric cooperative corporation at rates that shall not exceed the then-effective rates in the existing agreement, subject to permissible periodic rate adjustments provided in the existing agreement. (5) An electric cooperative corporation may not do any of the following: (i) require a person to purchase broadband services from an affiliate of the electric cooperative corporation as a condition of receiving or continuing to receive electric energy from the electric cooperative corporation; or (ii) disconnect, or threaten to disconnect, electric service to a customer due to the customer's failure to pay for broadband services provided to the customer by the electric cooperative corporation or an affiliate. (b) Applicability.-- Except for the replacement or relocation of existing poles or as otherwise provided by law, subsection (a)(2) shall not apply to the attachment of broadband facilities that are additional freestanding or ground-based structures within the easement. (c) Cross-subsidization.-- The following shall apply: (1) An electric cooperative corporation that supplies retail broadband services through an affiliate shall ensure that the rates charged for the provision of electric service do not include any of its affiliate's retail broadband service costs and shall not use its electric service revenues to subsidize the provision of retail broadband services to the public by an affiliate. (2) An electric cooperative corporation may make capital investments in an affiliate, make loans for the benefit of an affiliate, enter into capital or operating leases with an affiliate and enter into guarantees or other security arrangements for the benefit of an affiliate, all of which may be in amounts, on terms and subject to conditions as the electric cooperative corporation's board of directors approves and determines to be prudent or appropriate. (d) Construction.-- Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall limit any of the rights that exist under the laws of this Commonwealth of any broadband service supplier to secure its own easements for the construction or installation of broadband facilities or the provision of broadband services or to negotiate separate terms or agreements for attachments to electric infrastructure, owned or controlled by an electric cooperative corporation.",

(2) For all costs which the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or other wrongful act or omission. (b) Claims after declarant control.-- If a claim for a tort or breach of contract is made after the period of declarant control, the association shall have no right against the declarant under this section unless the association has given the declarant: (1) Notice of the existence of such a claim promptly after the date on which one or more members of the executive board who are not designees of the declarant learns of the existence of such a claim.

Except as is otherwise provided in section 4321(h), if fewer than all the units or limited common elements are to be conveyed or subjected to a security interest, then all the proprietary lessees of those units or the units to which those limited common elements are allocated must agree in order to convey those units or limited common elements or subject them to a security interest. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association. (b) Execution and recording of agreement to convey or encumber.-- An agreement to convey a part of the cooperative or subject it to a security interest must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of proprietary lessees. The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date. The agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the cooperative is situated and is effective only upon recordation. (c) Powers of association.-- The association, on behalf of the proprietary lessees, may contract to convey a part of the cooperative or subject it to a security interest, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary to execute deeds or other instruments. (d) Unauthorized conveyance or encumbrance void.-- Any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, tax sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of the cooperative, unless made pursuant to this section or section 4217(c) (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), is void. (e) Right of access and support preserved.-- A conveyance or encumbrance of the cooperative pursuant to this section does not deprive any unit of its rights of access and support. (f) Subject to declaration.-- A part of the cooperative which is subject to the declaration prior to conveyance or encumbrance shall remain subject to the provisions of the declaration following the conveyance or encumbrance, unless the deed or agreement to convey the cooperative or subject it to a security interest specifically provides otherwise.

The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies. (2) Liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements and units. (3) Any property or comprehensive general liability insurance carried by the association may contain a deductible provision. (b) Other insurance carried by association.-- If the insurance described in subsection (a) is not reasonably available, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by the United States mail to all proprietary lessees. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance in such reasonable amounts and with such reasonable deductibles as the executive board may deem appropriate to protect the association or the proprietary lessees. (c) Contents of insurance policies.-- Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection (a) must provide that: (1) Each proprietary lessee is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his interest in the common elements or membership in the association. (2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any proprietary lessee or member of his household. (3) No act or omission by any proprietary lessee, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy. (4) If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a proprietary lessee covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance. (d) Proceeds from property insurance.-- Any loss covered by the property policy under subsection (a)(1) must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose or otherwise to the association and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a mortgage or deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for the association, proprietary lessees and the lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (g), the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and the association, proprietary lessees and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored or the cooperative is terminated. (e) Unit owner may obtain insurance.-- A proprietary lessee may insure the lessee's unit for all losses to his unit, including losses not covered by the insurance maintained by the association, due to a deductible provision or otherwise. An insurance policy issued to the association shall not prevent a proprietary lessee from obtaining insurance for his own benefit, including insurance to cover any deductibles or losses not covered by the association's property or comprehensive general liability insurance. (f) Evidence and cancellation of insurance.-- An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any proprietary lessee or holder of a security interest. The insurer issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse to renew it until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each proprietary lessee and each holder of a security interest to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses. (g) Disposition of insurance proceeds.-- (1) Any portion of the cooperative for which insurance is required under this section which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless: (i) the cooperative is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80% of the proprietary lessees, including every proprietary lessee of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. Except for the costs of repair or replacement which are not covered due to deductibles, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves which have not been identified by the executive board to fund costs of capital expenditures for the current fiscal year of the association is a common expense. (2) If the entire cooperative is not repaired or replaced: (i) the insurance proceeds attributed to the damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the cooperative; and (ii) except to the extent that other persons will be distributees and except as is otherwise provided in section 4321(i) (relating to limited equity cooperatives): (A) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements which are not rebuilt must be distributed to the proprietary lessees of those units and the proprietary lessees of the units to which those limited common elements were located or to lienholders, as their interests may appear; and (B) the remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to all the proprietary lessees or lienholders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common expense liabilities of all the cooperative interests. If the proprietary lessees vote not to rebuild any unit, the allocated interests of the cooperative interest of which that unit is a part are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under section 4107(a) (relating to eminent domain), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, section 4217 (relating to termination of cooperative ownership) governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the cooperative is terminated. (h) Nonresidential cooperative.-- The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a cooperative all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use. (i) Recovery of deductibles.-- If an insurance policy maintained by the association contains a deductible, then that portion of any loss or claim which is not covered by insurance due to the application of a deductible, as well as any claim or loss for which the association is self-insured, shall be levied by the executive board in accordance with section 4314(c) (relating to assessments for common expenses).

      "text": "§ 4314. Assessments for common expenses. (a) General rule.-- Until the association makes a common expense assessment, the declarant shall pay all common expenses. After any assessment has been made by the association, assessments must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least annually by the association, subject, however, to the provisions of section 4303(c) (relating to executive board members and officers) concerning ratification of the budget by the association. (b) Allocation and interest.-- Except for assessments under subsections (c), (d) and (e) and except as provided in subsection (g) with respect to cooperative interests owned by declarant, all common expenses must be assessed against all the cooperative interests in accordance with the allocations set forth in the declaration pursuant to section 4207(a) (relating to allocation of ownership interests, votes and common expense liabilities). Any past due common expense assessment or installment thereof shall bear interest at the rate established by the association from time to time by prior written notice to all propriety lessees. (c) Limited expenses.-- Unless otherwise required by the declaration or as is otherwise provided in section 4321(j) (relating to limited equity cooperatives): (1) any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair or replacement of a limited common element must be assessed against the cooperative interests for the units to which that limited common element is assigned equally or in any other proportion that the declaration provides; and (2) any common expense or portion thereof benefiting fewer than all of the units must be assessed exclusively against the cooperative interests for the units benefited. (d) Insurance costs.-- If required by the declaration, the costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk, and the costs of utilities must be assessed in proportion to usage. (e) Payment of judgments.-- Assessments to pay a judgment against the association (section 4317(a)) may be made only against the cooperative interests in the cooperative at the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities. (f) Common expense attributable to proprietary lessee.-- If any common expense is caused by the action or failure to act of any proprietary lessee, the association may assess that expense exclusively against him or his cooperative interest or both of them. (g) Reallocated common expense liabilities.-- If common expense liabilities are reallocated, common expense assessments and any installment thereof not yet due shall be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities. (h) Crediting of excess assessments.-- Any amounts accumulated from assessments for limited common expenses and income from the operation of limited common elements to which such limited common expenses pertain in excess of the amount required for actual limited common expenses and reserves for future limited common expenses shall be credited to the cooperative interest assessed for a share of such limited common expenses in proportion to the share of such limited common expenses so assessed. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the credits shall be applied to the next monthly assessments of limited common expenses against the cooperative interest under the then current fiscal year's budget and, thereafter, until exhausted. Any amounts accumulated from assessments for general common expenses and income from the operation of the common elements, other than limited common elements with regard to which limited common expenses are assessed, in excess of the amount required for actual general common expenses and reserve for future general common expenses shall be credited to each cooperative interest in accordance with the allocations set forth in the declaration, unless the declaration provides otherwise, to the next monthly assessments of general common expenses against the cooperative interest under the then current fiscal year's budget and thereafter, until exhausted.

      "heading": "Lien for assessments.",
      "text": "§ 4315. Lien for assessments. (a) General rule.-- The association has a lien on a cooperative interest for any assessment levied against that cooperative interest, including payments to be made by declarant pursuant to section 4314(g) (relating to assessments for common expenses), or fines imposed against its owner from the time the assessment or fine becomes due. A judicial or other sale of the cooperative interest shall not affect the lien of a mortgage thereon if the mortgage is or shall be prior to all other liens upon the same property except those liens identified in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8152(a) (relating to judicial sale as affecting lien of mortgage) and liens for cooperative assessments created under this section. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines and interest charged pursuant to section 4302(a)(11) and (12) (relating to powers of association) and reasonable costs and expenses of the association, including legal fees, incurred in connection with collection of any sums due the association by the unit owner or enforcement of the provisions of the declaration, bylaws, rules or regulations against the unit owner are enforceable as assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in installments and one or more installments is not paid when due, the entire outstanding balance becomes effective as a lien from the due date of the delinquent installment. Upon nonpayment of the assessment, the proprietary lessee may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed by judicial sale of the cooperative interest in like manner as a mortgage on real estate. (b) Priority of lien.-- (1) A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a cooperative interest except: (i) Liens and encumbrances on the cooperative which the association creates, assumes or takes subject to. (ii) (A) The first security interest encumbering only the cooperative interest and perfected before the date on which the assessment or the first installment payable on the assessment, if the assessment is payable in installments, sought to be enforced became delinquent. (B) Judgments obtained for obligations secured by a security interest under clause (A). (iii) Liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the cooperative or the cooperative interest. (2) The association's lien for assessments shall be divested by a judicial sale of the cooperative interest: (i) As to unpaid common expense assessments made under section 4314(b) that come due during the six months immediately preceding the date of a judicial sale of a cooperative interest in an action to enforce collection of a lien against a cooperative interest by a judicial sale, only to the extent that the six months unpaid assessments are paid out of the proceeds of the sale. (ii) As to unpaid common expense assessments made under section 4314(b) other than the six months assessment referred to in subparagraph (i), in the full amount of these unpaid assessments, whether or not the proceeds of the judicial sale are adequate to pay these assessments. To the extent the proceeds of the sale are sufficient to pay some or all of these additional assessments, after satisfaction in full of the costs of the judicial sale, and the liens and encumbrances of the types described in paragraph (1) and the unpaid common expense assessments that come due during the six-month period described in subparagraph (i), they shall be paid before any remaining proceeds may be paid to any other claimant, including the prior owner of the cooperative interest. (3) The lien is not subject to the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8123 (relating to general monetary exemption). (c) Multiple liens on same property.-- Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority. (d) Notice and perfection of lien.-- Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. No further recordation or filing of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required. (e) Limitation of actions.-- A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within three years after the date on which the full amount of the assessment becomes due or, if paid in installments, the date on which the first installment payable on the assessment becomes due. (f) Other remedies preserved.-- This section does not prohibit actions to recover sums for which subsection (a) creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a transfer or assignment in lieu of foreclosure. (g) Costs and attorney fees.-- A judgment or decree in any action brought under this section must include costs and reasonable attorney fees for the prevailing party. (h) Statement of unpaid assessments.-- The association, upon written request, shall furnish to a proprietary lessee a statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments against his cooperative interest. The statement must be in recordable form. The statement must be furnished within ten business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive board and every proprietary lessee. (i) Application of payments.-- (1) Unless the declaration otherwise provides, any payment received by an association in connection with the lien under this section shall be applied: (i) First to any interest accrued by the association. (ii) Second to any late fee. (iii) Third to any costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the association in collection or enforcement. (iv) Last to the delinquent assessment. (2) Paragraph (1) shall apply notwithstanding any restrictive endorsement, designation or instructions placed on or accompanying a payment.

In case of judicial sale or payment to the sheriff in lieu of sale, liens and encumbrances shall be divested and proceeds distributed as if the right to terminate were deemed to be a lien for nonpayment of assessments under section 4315 (relating to lien for assessments), arising as of the date of commencement of the action. (b) Enforcement of proprietary lease.-- The association shall have the right, at its option, to enforce the provisions of the proprietary lease, including termination of the cooperative interest for default thereunder, under the provisions of the act of April 6, 1951 (P.L.69, No.20), known as The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951, as amended, or by any other means available to it at law or in equity.

In the event the proprietary lessee appeals an adverse decision in any court in which the association seeks to enforce its rights, the appeal may be dismissed, upon motion of the association, by the court in which the appeal is pending, if the proprietary lessee has not paid all the lessee's common expense assessments as they become due both prior to and during the pendency of the appeal, subject to any final judicial determination of the proprietary lessee's liability to make the payments if that is an issue in the appeal.

If required by the county, an amendment may be indexed against a parcel assigned to each unit within the planned community, but no fees shall be charged to each unit unless the indexing against each parcel is requested by the declarant or association.

(d) When unanimous consent or declarant joinder required.-- (1) Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other provisions of this subpart, without unanimous consent of all unit owners affected, no amendment may create or increase special declarant rights, alter the terms or provisions governing the completion or conveyance or lease of common facilities or increase the number of units or change the boundaries of any unit, the common expense liability or voting strength in the association allocated to a unit or the uses to which any unit is restricted.

      "text": "§ 5220. Termination of planned community. (a) Number of votes required.-- Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain in section 5107 (relating to eminent domain), a planned community may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least 80%, or such larger percentage specified in the declaration, of the votes in the association are allocated. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the planned community are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (b) Execution and recording agreement and ratifications.-- An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution or ratification of a termination agreement, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners who are owners of record as of the date preceding the date of recording of the termination agreement. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. The termination agreement shall become void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of the expiration of one year from the date it was first executed and ratified by a unit owner or such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the planned community is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the planned community in both the grantor and grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recording. (c) Sale of real estate.-- The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in the planned community. The contract is not binding until approved under subsections (a) and (b). If any real estate in the planned community is to be sold by the association following termination, title to that real estate upon termination vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (f). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the owner's unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this subpart or the declaration. (d) Nonsale upon termination.-- If the real estate constituting the planned community is not to be sold following termination, title to the common facilities and, in a planned community containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the planned community vest in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (f), and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the owner's unit. (e) Proceeds of sale.-- Following termination of the planned community, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units which were recorded, filed of public record or otherwise perfected before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination. (f) Respective interests of unit owners.-- The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (c), (d) and (e) are as follows: (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units and limited common elements immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements. (2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common expense liabilities immediately before the termination. (g) Effect of foreclosure or enforcement of lien.-- Except as provided in subsection (h), foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire planned community does not of itself terminate the planned community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the planned community does not of itself withdraw that portion from the planned community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the planned community, but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the planned community. (h) Exclusion from planned community upon foreclosure.-- If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the planned community has priority over the declaration and if the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the planned community. (i) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.-- In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the planned community other than a provision for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the planned community would otherwise be terminated, owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.

(a) Applicability of section.-- If the declaration for a planned community provides that any of the powers described in section 5302 (relating to power of unit owners' association) with respect to the planned community are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association (a \"master association\") which exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more other planned communities or other incorporated or unincorporated associations, then, except as modified by this section, all provisions of this subpart applicable to unit owners' associations shall apply to any such master association insofar as its actions affect the planned community. (b) Powers.-- Unless a master association is acting in the capacity of an association described in section 5301 (relating to organization of unit owners' association) with respect to a planned community which is part of the master association, it may exercise with respect to the planned community only such powers set forth in section 5302 and only to the extent expressly permitted in the declaration which provides for the delegation of powers from its planned community association to the master association and accepted by the master association, as indicated in the provisions of the declaration or other organizational documents of the master association. (c) Liability of executive board members and officers.-- If the declaration of a planned community provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board have no liability for the acts or omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following delegation. The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the planned community association whose powers are delegated to the master association and the unit owners of the planned community on the same basis as officers and executive board members of the planned community immediately before such delegation of powers. (d) Rights and responsibilities of persons electing governing body.-- The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in sections 5302, 5303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 5309 (relating to quorums), 5310 (relating to voting; proxies) and 5320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association with respect to the exercise of powers elected pursuant to a planned community declaration to the master association, but apply only to those persons who elect the governing body of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this subpart. (e) Election of master association governing body.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5303(e) with respect to the election of the executive board by all unit owners after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 5301, the instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each planned community of the organizational documents of other associations, the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association, shall provide that the governing body of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways: (1) All unit owners of all planned communities and other properties subject to the master association elect all members of the governing body of the master association. (2) All members of the governing bodies of the planned community associations and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect all members of the master association governing body. (3) All unit owners of each planned community and other property owners' association subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (4) All members of the governing bodies of the planned communities and other property associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body. (e.1) Independent reviewer.-- The instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each planned community of the organizational documents of other associations, the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association, shall also provide that a vote by a unit owner in an election of the members of the master association governing body must be submitted by the unit owner to an independent reviewer who shall tally the results of the election and certify the results to the executive board and unit owner. In order to be eligible to vote in the election, a unit owner shall be in good standing with the association. The executive board shall present the official election results based on the certified election report from the independent reviewer at a meeting of the unit owners and shall enter the results in the meeting records. All votes by unit owners under this subsection shall be submitted to the independent reviewer in accordance with the approved methods of voting as provided under this subpart. This subsection shall only apply to a planned community with at least 500 units. If a planned community has less than 500 units, the master association may opt in to the requirements under this subsection by a vote of at least 51% of the votes collected from the unit owners in person, electronically or by absentee ballot which are in favor of the requirements under this subsection. (f) Delegation of responsibility and authority.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to a planned community upon any of the following: (1) A date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the planned community. (2) An event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that: (i) the event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the planned community; and (ii) a copy of such instrument has been sent to all unit owners. (3) The declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the planned community and that a copy of such instrument has been sent to the executive board and all unit owners. This paragraph shall be applicable only if the declarant shall have expressly reserved in the declaration, under section 5205(13) (relating to contents of declaration; all planned communities), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the planned community and only if the instrument exercising such right has been recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right. (g) Delegation of all powers.-- If all of the powers of a planned community association are delegated to a master association and accepted by the master association under subsection (b), then the governing body of the master association may act in all respects as the executive board of the planned community, and no separate executive board need be elected or exist.

      "text": "§ 5223. Merger or consolidation of planned community. (a) General rule.-- Any two or more planned communities by agreement of the unit owners as provided in subsection (b) may be merged or consolidated into a single planned community. In the event of a merger or consolidation, unless the agreement otherwise provides, the resultant planned community is, for all purposes, the legal successor of all of the preexisting planned communities, and the operations and activities of all associations of the preexisting planned communities shall be merged or consolidated into a single association which shall hold all powers, rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of all preexisting associations. The resultant planned community shall, in addition, be subject in all respects to the provisions and requirements of this subpart regardless of whether or not any of the preexisting planned communities have been established under this subpart. (b) Requirements of agreement.-- The merger or consolidation of two or more planned communities under subsection (a) must be evidenced by a recorded agreement duly executed by the president of the association of each of the preexisting planned communities following approval by owners of units to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each planned community required to terminate such planned community. Any such agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the planned community is located and is not effective until so recorded. (c) Reallocations.-- (1) Every merger or consolidation agreement must provide for the reallocation of the common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association among the units of the resulting planned community in one of the following manners: (i) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based; or (ii) by stating the common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association which are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting planned communities, and providing that the common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the association for the resulting planned community shall be the same as was allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting planned community by the declaration of the preexisting planned community. (d) Action by declarant.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), if a declarant shall have expressly retained the special declarant right to merge or consolidate a planned community under section 5205(14) (relating to contents of declaration; all planned communities) and if the declarant shall have exercised such right within the time period allowed for such exercise by giving written notice to that effect to all unit owners accompanied by a copy of the agreement evidencing such merger or consolidation, then such agreement may be executed by the declarant rather than by the president of the association of that planned community and without the necessity for approval or consent by unit owners or their mortgagees, provided that the agreement is recorded within the time period allowed for the exercise of this special declarant right.
