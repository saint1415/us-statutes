An amendment is effective only upon recordation.\n\n(2) Except for counties which do not maintain a uniform parcel identifier number system of indexing, all counties shall assign a master parcel number to each condominium, and every amendment to the declaration shall be indexed against the master parcel.

      "text": "(a) Number of votes required.--Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain (section 3107), a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.\n\n(b) Execution and recording agreement and ratifications.--An agreement of unit owners to terminate a condominium must be evidenced by their execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners who are owners of record as of the date preceding the date of recordation of the termination agreement. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. The termination agreement will become null and void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of:\n\n(1) The expiration of one year from the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner.\n\n(2) Such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement.\n\nIf, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the terms of the sale. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the condominium in both the grantor index and the grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recordation.\n\n(c) Status if real estate sold.--The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). If the real estate constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (f). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this subpart or the declaration.\n\n(d) Status if real estate not sold.--If the real estate constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to the real estate, upon termination, vests in the unit owners as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (f) and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit.\n\n(e) Distribution of assets of association.--Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, shall be held by the association as trustee or unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units which were recorded, filed of public record or otherwise perfected before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.\n\n(f) Respective interests of unit owners.--The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (c), (d) and (e) are as follows:\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements and common element interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements.\n\n(2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof prior to destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination.\n\n(g) Effect of foreclosure or enforcement of lien.--Except as provided in subsection (h), foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the condominium.\n\n(h) Exclusion from condominium upon foreclosure.--If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over the declaration and if the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium.\n\n(i) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.--In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the condominium other than a provision providing for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the condominium would otherwise be terminated owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the condominium are allocated vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.\n\n(Dec. 18, 1992, P.L.1279, No.168, eff. 45 days; Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1509, No.191, eff. 60 days)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 191 added subsec.

The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the condominium association whose powers are delegated thereto and the unit owners of such condominium on the same basis as officers and executive board members of such condominium immediately before such delegation of powers.\n\n(d) Rights and responsibilities of persons electing governing body.--The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in sections 3303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 3308 (relating to meetings), 3309 (relating to quorums), 3310 (relating to voting; proxies) and 3320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association with respect to the exercise of powers delegated pursuant to a condominium declaration to such master association, but apply only to those persons who elect the governing body of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this subpart.\n\n(e) Election of master association governing body.--Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3303(e) with respect to the election of the executive board by all unit owners after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 3301, the instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each condominium or the organizational documents of other associations the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association shall provide that the governing body of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways:\n\n(1) All unit owners of all condominiums and other properties subject to the master association elect all members of the governing body of the master association.\n\n(2) All members of the governing bodies of the condominium associations and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect all members of the master association governing body.\n\n(3) All unit owners of each condominium and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body.\n\n(4) All members of the governing bodies of the condominiums and other property associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body.\n\n(f) Delegation of responsibility and authority.--The provisions of this section shall apply to a condominium if and when:\n\n(1) there occurs either a date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the condominium;\n\n(2) there occurs an event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable, and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that:\n\n(i) such event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the condominium; and\n\n(ii) that a copy of such instrument has been sent to all unit owners; or\n\n(3) the declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the condominium and that a copy of such instrument has been sent to the executive board and all unit owners.\n\nParagraph (3) shall be applicable only if the declarant shall have expressly reserved in the declaration, pursuant to section 3205(12) (relating to contents of declaration; all condominiums), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the condominium and only if the instrument exercising such right shall have been recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right.\n\n(g) Delegation of all powers.--If all the powers of a condominium association are delegated to a master association and accepted by such master association pursuant to subsection (b), then the governing body of the master association may act in all respects as the executive board of the condominium and no separate executive board need be elected or exist.\n\n(Dec. 18, 1992, P.L.1279, No.168, eff. 45 days)\n\n1992 Amendment.Act 168 added section 3222.\n\nCross References.Section 3222 is referred to in sections 3102, 3103, 3205, 3302 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) General rule.--Any two or more condominiums by agreement of the unit owners as provided in subsection (b) may be merged or consolidated into a single condominium. In the event of a merger or consolidation, unless the agreement otherwise provides, the resultant condominium is, for all purposes, the legal successor of all of the preexisting condominiums, and the operations and activities of all associations of the preexisting condominiums shall be merged or consolidated into a single association which shall hold all powers, rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of all preexisting associations. The resultant condominium shall, in addition, be subject in all respects to the provisions and requirements of this subpart regardless of whether or not any of the preexisting condominiums shall have been established under this subpart.\n\n(b) Requirements of agreement.--The merger or consolidation of two or more condominiums pursuant to subsection (a) must be evidenced by a recorded agreement duly executed by the president of the association of each of the preexisting condominiums following approval by owners of units to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each condominium required to terminate such condominium. Any such agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is located and is not effective until so recorded.\n\n(c) Reallocations.--Every merger or consolidation agreement must provide for the reallocation of the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association among the units of the resulting condominium either:\n\n(1) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based; or\n\n(2) by stating the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association which are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting condominiums, and providing that the common element interests, common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the association for the resulting condominium shall be the same as was allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting condominium by the declaration of the preexisting condominium.\n\n(d) Action by declarant.--Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), if a declarant expressly retained the special declarant right to merge or consolidate a condominium pursuant to section 3205(13) (relating to contents of declaration; all condominiums) and if the declarant exercised such right within the time period allowed for such exercise by giving written notice to that effect to all unit owners accompanied by a copy of the agreement evidencing such merger or consolidation, then such agreement may be executed by the declarant rather than by the president of the association of that condominium and without the necessity for approval or consent by unit owners or their mortgagees, provided that the agreement is recorded within the time period allowed for the exercise of this special declarant right.\n\n(Dec. 18, 1992, P.L.1279, No.168, eff. 45 days)\n\n1992 Amendment.Act 168 added section 3223.\n\nCross References.Section 3223 is referred to in sections 3102, 3103, 3205 of this title.",
