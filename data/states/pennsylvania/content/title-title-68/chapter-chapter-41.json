By compliance with the requirements of section 4201 (relating to creation of cooperative ownership), a cooperative created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart may be made subject to all of the provisions of this subpart, effective as of the date of recordation of the document or documents specified in section 4201, without in any way terminating the cooperative status of the property or in any way affecting any lien or encumbrance on the property, if the terms of such document or documents have been approved by all the persons whose actions would have been required to effect the termination of the cooperative pursuant to its governing documents in effect at the time such approval is given, provided, however, that such action shall not increase the obligations or responsibilities of a declarant, as such and not as a proprietary lessee, without the joinder of the declarant in the document or documents required by section 4201.\n\n(b.1) Retroactivity.--\n\n(1) Sections 4103, 4108 (relating to supplemental general principles of law applicable), 4112 (relating to obligation of good faith), 4216 (relating to amendment of declaration), 4217(g) (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), 4302(a)(8)(i) and (9), 4303(a), (b) and (c) (relating to executive board members and officers), 4307 (relating to upkeep of cooperative), 4314 (relating to assessments for common expenses) and 4316 (relating to other liens affecting cooperative), to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives.\n\n(2) Section 4303(d), to the extent necessary in construing that subsection, applies to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but the subsection applies only with respect to events and circumstances occurring 180 days after the effective date of this subsection and does not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those cooperatives.\n\n(c) Units restricted to nonresidential use.--If a cooperative created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains only units restricted to nonresidential use, it is subject only to sections 4106 and 4107 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that cooperative from the date such amended declaration is recorded as required for a declaration under section 4201.\n\n(d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.--In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart:\n\n(1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart.\n\n(2) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made pursuant to this subpart.\n\nAn amendment to the declaration or bylaws authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the declaration and bylaws being amended. If any such amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this subpart, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in this subpart also apply to that person.\n\n(e) Cooperative interests outside Commonwealth.--This subpart does not apply to cooperative interests located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions (sections 4401 through 4408) apply to all cooperative interests offered within this Commonwealth for which either the contract for disposition is executed by any party within this Commonwealth or the disposition is effectuated within this Commonwealth unless exempt under section 4401(b) (relating to applicability; waiver).\n\n(f) Liens and security interests.--The enactment of this subpart shall not affect any lien upon a cooperative or any lien upon or security interest in any property of the association or in any cooperative interest if such lien or security interest shall have been perfected prior to the effective date of this subpart.\n\n(Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1499, No.190, eff. 60 days)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 190 added subsec. (b.1).\n\nCross References.Section 4102 is referred to in section 4403 of this title.",
