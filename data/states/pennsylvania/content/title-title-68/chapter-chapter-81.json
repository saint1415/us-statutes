      "text": "The General Assembly finds and declares that the public policy of this Commonwealth favors the marketability of real property and the transferability of interests in real property free of title defects or unreasonable restraints on alienation. The General Assembly further finds and declares that private transfer fee obligations violate this public policy by impairing the marketability and transferability of real property and by constituting an unreasonable restraint on alienation regardless of the duration of the obligation to pay a private transfer fee, the amount of a private transfer fee or the method by which any private transfer fee is created or imposed. Thus, the General Assembly finds and declares that a private transfer fee obligation shall not run with the title to property or otherwise bind subsequent owners of property under any common law or equitable principle.",
