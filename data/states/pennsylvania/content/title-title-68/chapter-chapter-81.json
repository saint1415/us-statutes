In such event, the private transfer fee obligation shall become null and void, and the real property shall be conveyed free and clear of the private transfer fee and private transfer fee obligation.\n\n(d) Defective notice.--If a payee records a materially defective or misleading notice under subsection (a), then a grantor, on recording of an affidavit under subsection (f), may convey an interest in the real property to a grantee without payment of the private transfer fee and shall not be subject to any further obligations under the private transfer fee obligation. In such event, the private transfer fee obligation shall become null and void, and the real property shall be conveyed free and clear of the private transfer fee and private transfer fee obligation.\n\n(e) Failure to provide statement of private transfer fee.--Should a payee fail to provide a written statement of the private transfer fee payable within 30 days of the date of a written request for the same sent to the address shown in the notice of private transfer fee, then a grantor, on recording of an affidavit under subsection (f), may convey an interest in the real property to a grantee without payment of the private transfer fee and shall not be subject to any further obligations under the private transfer fee obligation.
