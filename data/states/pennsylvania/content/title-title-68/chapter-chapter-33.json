If the owner of a unit is a trust, the trustee or trustees shall be deemed to be the owner for the voting purposes. Where the ownership of a unit is in more than one person, the natural person who shall be entitled to cast the vote of such unit shall be the person named in a certificate executed by all of the owners of such unit and filed with the secretary or, in the absence of such named person from the meeting or the failure to execute and file such a certificate, the person who shall be entitled to cast the vote of such unit shall be the person owning such unit who is present. If more than one of the multiple owners are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with their unanimous agreement unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There shall be deemed to be unanimous agreement if any one of the multiple owners casts the votes allocated to that unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other owners of the unit. Such certificate shall be valid until revoked by a subsequent certificate similarly executed. Except where execution by owners of a unit in the same manner as a deed is required in this subpart and subject to the provisions of the declaration and bylaws, wherever the approval or disapproval of a unit owner is required by this subpart, the declaration or the bylaws, such approval or disapproval shall be made only by the person who would be entitled to cast the vote of such unit at any meeting of the association.\n\n(b) Proxies.--Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a proxy duly executed by a unit owner. If a unit is owned by more than one person, each owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy. A unit owner may not revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section except by actual notice of revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the association. A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice. A proxy terminates one year after its date unless it specifies a shorter term.\n\n(c) Cumulative and class voting.--(Deleted by amendment).\n\n(d) Units owned by association.--No votes allocated to a unit owned by the association may be cast.\n\n(e) Approved methods of voting.--Methods of voting shall be in accordance with the following:\n\n(1) Except to the extent expressly prohibited in an association's declaration or bylaws, the voting rights of a unit owner may be cast or given in the following ways:\n\n(i) in person or by proxy at a meeting of the association;\n\n(ii) by absentee or electronic ballot in accordance with this subpart; or\n\n(iii) by another method of voting expressly provided in the association's declaration or bylaws.\n\n(2) An absentee or electronic ballot may:\n\n(i) Be counted as a unit owner present and voting for the purpose of establishing a quorum, and otherwise, only for agenda items appearing on the ballot.\n\n(ii) Not be counted even if properly delivered, if the unit owner attends the meeting to vote in person. A vote cast at a meeting by a unit owner supersedes a vote submitted by absentee or electronic ballot previously submitted for that agenda item.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"electronic ballot\" means a ballot cast or given by electronic transmission over the Internet, vote management system or the association's community network, whether by direct connection, intranet, telecopier, electronic mail or other technological means, if the identity of the unit owner submitting the ballot can be confirmed and a receipt of the electronic transmission and ballot can be made available to the unit owner.\n\n(f) Acclamation.--Unless the bylaws of the association provide otherwise, in the event that an election for a position on the executive board is uncontested, the officer or chair presiding at the election meeting may declare the nominee elected by acclamation after determining there are no further nominations.\n\n(Dec. 18, 1992, P.L.1279, No.168, eff. 45 days; Nov. 3, 2022, P.L.1750, No.115, eff. 180 days)\n\n2022 Amendment.Act 115 added subsecs.

      "text": "(a) Insurance to be carried by association.--Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available:\n\n(1) Property insurance on the common elements and units exclusive of improvements and betterments installed in units insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against or, in the case of a conversion building, against fire and extended coverage perils. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies.\n\n(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements.\n\n(3) Any property or comprehensive general liability insurance carried by the association may contain a deductible provision.\n\n(b) Other insurance carried by association.--If the insurance described in subsection (a) is not maintained, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to all unit owners. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance and the association in any event may carry any other insurance in such reasonable amounts and with such reasonable deductibles as the executive board may deem appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.\n\n(c) Contents of insurance policies.--Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection (a) must provide that:\n\n(1) Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his ownership of an undivided interest in the common elements or membership in the association.\n\n(2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner of the condominium or members of his household.\n\n(3) No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy.\n\n(4) If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same property covered by the policy, the policy is primary insurance not contributing with the other insurance.\n\n(d) Proceeds from property insurance.--Any loss covered by the property policy under subsection (a)(1) shall be adjusted with the association but the insurance proceeds for that loss shall be payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose or otherwise to the association and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (g), the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged common elements and units and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the common elements and units have been completely repaired or restored or the condominium is terminated.\n\n(e) Unit owner may obtain insurance.--A unit owner may insure his unit for all losses to his unit, including all losses not covered by the insurance maintained by the association due to a deductible provision or otherwise. An insurance policy issued to the association shall not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for his own benefit.\n\n(f) Evidence and cancellation of insurance.--An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon request, to any unit owner, mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance may not be cancelled until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to whom certificates of insurance have been issued.\n\n(g) Disposition of insurance proceeds.--\n\n(1) Any portion of the condominium damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless:\n\n(i) the condominium is terminated;\n\n(ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or\n\n(iii) eighty percent of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.\n\nExcept for the costs of repair or replacement which are not covered due to deductibles, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves which have not been identified by the executive board to fund costs of capital expenditures for the current fiscal year of the association is a common expense.\n\n(2) If the entire condominium is not repaired or replaced:\n\n(i) the insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium;\n\n(ii) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements which are not rebuilt shall be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were assigned; and\n\n(iii) the remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners in proportion to their common element interests.\n\nIf the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's entire common element interest, votes in the association and common expense liability are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under section 3107(a) (relating to eminent domain) and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, section 3220 (relating to termination of condominium) governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the condominium is terminated.\n\n(h) Nonresidential condominiums.--The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a condominium all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use.\n\n(i) Recovery of deductibles.--If any insurance policy maintained by the association contains a deductible, then that portion of any loss or claim which is not covered by insurance due to the application of a deductible, as well as any claim or loss for which the association is self-insured, shall be levied by the executive board in accordance with section 3314(c) (relating to assessments for common expenses).\n\n(Dec. 18, 1992, P.L.1279, No.168, eff. 45 days; Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1509, No.191, eff. 60 days)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 191 amended subsecs.

The association's lien may be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real estate. A judicial or other sale of the unit in execution of a common element lien or any other lien shall not affect the lien of a mortgage thereon, except the mortgage for which the sale is being held, if the mortgage is or shall be prior to all other liens upon the same property except those liens identified in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8152(a) (relating to judicial sale as affecting lien of mortgage) and liens for condominium assessments created under this section. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines and interest charged pursuant to section 3302(a)(10), (11) and (12) (relating to powers of unit owners' association) and reasonable costs and expenses of the association, including legal fees, incurred in connection with collection of any sums due the association by the unit owner or enforcement of the provisions of the declaration, bylaws, rules or regulations against the unit owner are enforceable as assessments under this section.

To the extent the proceeds of the sale are sufficient to pay some or all of these additional assessments, after satisfaction in full of the costs of the judicial sale, and the liens and encumbrances of the types described in paragraph (1) and the unpaid common expense assessments that come due during the six-month period described in subparagraph (i), they shall be paid before any remaining proceeds may be paid to any other claimant, including the prior owner of the unit.\n\n(3) Monetary exemption.--The lien is not subject to the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 8123 (relating to general monetary exemption).\n\n(c) Notice and perfection of lien.--Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien.\n\n(d) Limitation of actions.--A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien or actions or suits to recover sums for which subsection (a) establishes a lien are instituted within four years after the assessments become payable.\n\n(e) Other remedies preserved.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit actions or suits to recover sums for which subsection (a) creates a lien or to prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n\n(f) Costs and attorney's fees.--A judgment or decree in any action or suit brought under this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney's fees for the prevailing party.\n\n(g) Statement of unpaid assessments.--The association shall furnish to a unit owner upon written request a recordable statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments currently levied against his unit and any credits of surplus in favor of his unit pursuant to section 3313 (relating to surplus funds). The statement shall be furnished within ten business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive board and every unit owner.\n\n(h) Application of payments.--Unless the declaration otherwise provides, any payment received by an association in connection with the lien under this section shall be applied first to any interest accrued by the association, then to any late fee, then to any costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the association in collection or enforcement and then to the delinquent assessment.
