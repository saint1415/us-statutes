      "text": "(a) Powers and fiduciary status.--Except as provided in the declaration, the bylaws, in subsection (b) or other provisions of this subpart, the executive board may act in all instances on behalf of the association. In the performance of their duties, the officers and members of the executive board shall stand in a fiduciary relation to the association and shall perform their duties, including duties as members of any committee of the board upon which they may serve, in good faith in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the association and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances. In managing the association's reserve funds, the officers and members of the executive board shall have the power to invest the association's reserve funds in investments permissible by law for the investment of trust funds and shall be governed in the management of the association's reserve funds by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7203 (relating to prudent investor rule). In performing his duties, an officer or executive board member shall be entitled to rely in good faith on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented by any of the following:\n\n(1) One or more other officers or employees of the association whom the officer or executive board member reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented.\n\n(2) Counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters which the officer or executive board member reasonably believes to be within the professional or expert competence of such person.\n\n(3) A committee of the executive board upon which he does not serve, duly designated in accordance with law, as to matters within its designated authority, which committee the officer or executive board member reasonably believes to merit confidence.\n\nAn officer or executive board member shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if he has knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause his reliance to be unwarranted. The executive board and its members shall have no liability for exercising these powers provided they are exercised in good faith, in the best interest of the association and with such care in the manner set forth in this section.\n\n(b) Limitation on authority.--The executive board may not act on behalf of the association to amend the declaration (section 3219), to terminate the condominium (section 3220) or to elect members of the executive board or determine the qualifications, powers and duties or terms of office of executive board members (section 3303(e)) but the executive board may fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired portion of any term. The executive board shall deliver to all unit owners copies of each budget approved by the executive board and notice of any capital expenditure approved by the executive board promptly after either such approval. In addition to other rights conferred by the declaration, bylaws or this subpart, the unit owners, by majority or any larger vote specified in the declaration, may reject any budget or capital expenditure approved by the executive board, within 30 days after the approval.\n\n(c) Status during period of declarant control.--Subject to subsection (d), the declaration may provide for a period of declarant control of the association during which period a declarant or persons designated by him may appoint and remove the officers and members of the executive board. Any period of declarant control extends from the date of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant for a period not exceeding seven years in the case of a flexible condominium containing convertible real estate or to which additional real estate may be added, or five years in the case of any other condominium. Regardless of the period provided in the declaration, a period of declarant control terminates no later than 180 days after conveyance of 75% of the units to unit owners other than a declarant. A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and members of the executive board before termination of that period but in that event he may require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association or executive board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become effective.\n\n(d) Election of members during transfer of declarant control.--\n\n(1) Not later than 60 days after conveyance of 25% of the units to unit owners other than a declarant, not less than 25% of the members of the executive board shall be elected by unit owners other than the declarant.\n\n(2) Not later than 60 days after conveyance of 50% of the units to unit owners other than a declarant, not less than 33 1/3% of the members of the executive board shall be elected by unit owners other than the declarant.\n\n(e) Election of members and officers following declarant control.--\n\n(1) Not later than the termination of any period of declarant control, the unit owners shall elect an executive board of at least three members at least a majority of whom must be unit owners, except that the executive board may consist of two members, both of whom must be unit owners, if the condominium consists of two units. The executive board shall elect the officers. The persons elected shall take office upon election.\n\n(2) In the event that the election of the executive board by the unit owners fails to take place not later than the termination of a period of declarant control as provided in this section, then a special meeting of the unit owners may be called for such purpose by any member of the executive board elected by the unit owners or, if there is no such member of the executive board, the unit owners entitled to cast at least 10% of the votes in the association.\n\n(3) A vote by a unit owner must be submitted by the unit owner to an independent reviewer who shall tally the results of the election and certify the results to the executive board and unit owners. In order to be eligible to vote in the election, a unit owner shall be in good standing with the association. The executive board shall present the official election results based on the certified election report from the independent reviewer at a meeting of the unit owners and shall enter the results in the meeting records. All votes by unit owners under this paragraph shall be submitted to the independent reviewer in accordance with the approved methods of voting as provided in this subpart. This paragraph shall only apply to a condominium with at least 500 units. If a condominium has less than 500 units, the association may opt in to the requirements under this paragraph by a vote of at least 51% of the votes collected from the unit owners in person, electronically or by absentee ballot which are in favor of the requirements under this paragraph.\n\n(f) Calculation of percentages of units conveyed.--In determining whether the period of declarant control has terminated under subsection (c), or whether unit owners other than a declarant are entitled to elect members of the executive board under subsection (d), the percentage of the units conveyed is presumed to be that percentage which would have been conveyed if all the units the declarant has built or reserved the right to build in the declaration were included in the condominium.\n\n(g) Removal of member of executive board.--Notwithstanding any provision of the declaration or bylaws to the contrary, the unit owners, by a two-thirds vote of all persons present and entitled to vote at any meeting of the unit owners at which a quorum is present, may remove any member of the executive board with or without cause, other than a member appointed by the declarant, provided notice of the intention to remove a member of the executive board is given with the notice of the meeting at which such removal is considered, as provided under section 4303(g) (relating to executive board members and officers).\n\n(Dec. 18, 1992, P.L.1279, No.168, eff. 45 days; Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1509, No.191, eff. 60 days; Oct. 19, 2018, P.L.551, No.84, eff. 60 days; Nov. 3, 2022, P.L.1750, No.115, eff. 180 days)\n\n2022 Amendment.Act 115 amended subsecs.

The instrument is not effective unless executed by the transferee.\n\n(b) Liability of declarant following transfer.--Upon transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant is as follows:\n\n(1) A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed upon him by this subpart. Lack of privity does not deprive any unit owner of standing to bring an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor.\n\n(2) If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant (section 3103), the transferor is jointly and severally liable with any successor for the liabilities and obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to the condominium.\n\n(2.1) If a transferor retains any special declarant right, but transfers one or more other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant by this subpart or by the declaration relating to the retained special declarant rights arising after the transfer.\n\n(3) A transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor and to whom the special declarant right has not theretofore been assigned.\n\n(c) Rights of purchaser in foreclosure, etc. proceedings.--Unless otherwise provided in a mortgage instrument or deed of trust, in case of foreclosure of a mortgage, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or sale under 11 U.S.C. (relating to bankruptcy) or receivership proceedings of any units owned by a declarant in the condominium or additional real estate in a flexible condominium, a person acquiring title to all the units being foreclosed or sold, but only upon his request, succeeds to all special declarant rights related to such units or additional real estate, or only to any rights reserved in the declaration pursuant to section 3217 (relating to declarant's offices, models and signs) and held by that declarant to maintain models, sales offices and signs. The judgment or instrument conveying title shall provide for transfer of only the special declarant rights requested.\n\n(d) Rights of declarant following foreclosure, etc. proceedings.--Upon foreclosure, tax sale, judicial sale, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or sale under 11 U.S.C. (relating to bankruptcy) or receivership or similar proceedings of all units and other real estate in a condominium owned by a declarant:\n\n(1) the declarant ceases to have any special declarant rights; and\n\n(2) the period of declarant control (section 3303(c)) terminates unless the judgment or instrument conveying title provides for transfer of all special declarant rights held by that declarant to a successor declarant.\n\n(e) Liabilities and obligations of successors.--The liabilities and obligations of persons who succeed to special declarant rights are as follows:\n\n(1) A successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this subpart or by the declaration.\n\n(2) A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in paragraph (3) or (4), who is not an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed by this subpart or the declaration:\n\n(i) on a declarant which relate to his exercise or nonexercise of special declarant rights; or\n\n(ii) on his transferor, other than:\n\n(A) misrepresentations by any previous declarant, except to the extent knowingly continued or permitted to continue without correcting such misrepresentations;\n\n(B) warranty obligations on improvements made by any previous declarant or made before the condominium was created;\n\n(C) breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or his appointees to the executive board; or\n\n(D) any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or omissions after the transfer.\n\n(3) A successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices and signs (section 3217), if he is not an affiliate of a declarant, may not exercise any other special declarant right and is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant except the obligation to provide a public offering statement and any liability arising as a result thereof.\n\n(4) A successor to all special declarant rights held by his transferor who is not an affiliate of that transferor declarant and who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a judgment or instrument conveying title to units under subsection (c) may declare his intention in a recorded instrument to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, until transferring all special declarant rights to any person acquiring title to any unit owned by the successor or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by his transferor to control the executive board in accordance with the provisions of section 3303(c) (relating to executive board members and officers) for the duration of any period of declarant control and any attempted exercise of those rights is void. So long as a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under this subsection he is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant other than liability for the successor's acts and omissions under section 3303(c).\n\n(f) Limitation on liability of successor.--Nothing in this section subjects any successor to a special declarant right to any claims against or other obligations of a transferor declarant other than claims and obligations arising under this subpart or the declaration.\n\n(Dec. 18, 1992, P.L.1279, No.168, eff. 45 days)\n\nCross References.Section 3304 is referred to in section 3103 of this title.",
