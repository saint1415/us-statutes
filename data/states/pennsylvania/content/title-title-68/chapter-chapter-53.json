      "text": "(a) Unit owner other than natural person.--If the owner of a unit is a corporation, joint venture, partnership or unincorporated association, the natural person who shall be entitled to cast the vote for that unit shall be the person named in a certificate executed by that entity pursuant to its governing documents. If the owner of a unit is a trust, the trustee or trustees shall be deemed to be the owner for voting purposes. If the ownership of a unit is in more than one person, the natural person who shall be entitled to cast the vote of the unit shall be the person named in a certificate executed by all of the owners of the unit and filed with the secretary of the association or, in the absence of that named person from the meeting or in the event of failure to execute and file such a certificate, the person owning such unit who is present. If more than one of the multiple owners are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with their unanimous agreement unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There shall be deemed to be unanimous agreement if any one of the multiple owners casts the votes allocated to that unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other owners of the unit. Such a certificate shall be valid until revoked by a subsequent certificate similarly executed. Except where execution by owners of a unit in the same manner as a deed is required in this subpart and subject to the provisions of the declaration and bylaws, wherever the approval or disapproval of a unit owner is required by this subpart, the declaration or the bylaws, the approval or disapproval shall be made only by the person who would be entitled to cast the vote of the unit at any meeting of the association.\n\n(b) Proxies.--Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a proxy duly executed by a unit owner. If a unit is owned by more than one person, each owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy. A unit owner may not revoke a proxy given under this section except by actual notice of revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the association. A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice. A proxy terminates one year after its date unless it specifies a shorter term.\n\n(c) Voting by lessees.--If the declaration requires that votes on specified matters affecting the planned community be cast by lessees rather than unit owners of leased units, all of the following apply:\n\n(1) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) apply to lessees as if they were unit owners.\n\n(2) Unit owners who have leased their units to other persons may not cast votes on those specified matters.\n\n(3) Lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records and other rights respecting those matters as if they were unit owners.\n\nUnit owners shall also be given notice, in the manner provided in section 5308 (relating to meetings), of all meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.\n\n(d) Units owned by association.--No votes allocated to a unit owned by the association may be cast.\n\n(e) Approved methods of voting.--Methods of voting shall be in accordance with the following:\n\n(1) Except to the extent expressly prohibited in an association's declaration or bylaws, the voting rights of a unit owner may be cast or given in the following ways:\n\n(i) in person or by proxy at a meeting of the association;\n\n(ii) by absentee or electronic ballot in accordance with this subpart; or\n\n(iii) by another method of voting expressly provided in the association's declaration or bylaws.\n\n(2) An absentee or electronic ballot may:\n\n(i) Be counted as a unit owner present and voting for the purpose of establishing a quorum, and otherwise, only for agenda items appearing on the ballot.\n\n(ii) Not be counted even if properly delivered, if the unit owner attends the meeting to vote in person. A vote cast at a meeting by a unit owner supersedes a vote submitted by absentee or electronic ballot previously submitted for that agenda item.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"electronic ballot\" means a ballot cast or given by electronic transmission over the Internet, vote management system or the association's community network, whether by direct connection, intranet, telecopier, electronic mail or other technological means, if the identity of the unit owner submitting the ballot can be confirmed and a receipt of the electronic transmission and ballot can be made available to the unit owner.\n\n(f) Acclamation.--Unless the bylaws of the association provide otherwise, in the event that an election for a position on the executive board is uncontested, the officer or chair presiding at the election meeting may declare the nominee elected by acclamation after determining there are no further nominations.\n\n(Nov. 3, 2022, P.L.1750, No.115, eff. 180 days)\n\n2022 Amendment.Act 115 added subsecs.

If a claim for a tort or breach of contract is made after the period of declarant control, the association shall have no right against the declarant under this paragraph unless the association shall have given the declarant all of the following:\n\n(i) Notice of the existence of the claim promptly after the date on which a member of the executive board who is not a designee of the declarant learns of the existence of the claim.\n\n(ii) An opportunity to defend against the claim on behalf of the association but at the declarant's expense.\n\n(4) A unit owner is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this subsection because he is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association.\n\nAny statute of limitation affecting the association's right of action under this section is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates.\n\n(b) Lien of judgment.--Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a judgment for money against the association if and when entered of record against the name of the association in the office of the clerk of the court of common pleas of the county where the planned community is located shall also constitute a lien against each unit for a pro rata share of the amount of that judgment, including interest thereon, based on the common expense liability allocated to that unit under section 5208 (relating to allocation of votes and common expense liabilities). No other property of a unit owner is subject to the claims of creditors of the association.\n\n(c) Indexing judgment.--A judgment against the association must be indexed in the name of the planned community.\n\n(d) Applicability of section.--The provisions of this section shall apply to all associations without regard to whether the association is organized as a corporation or as an unincorporated association.\n\nCross References.Section 5311 is referred to in section 5102 of this title.",

The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies.\n\n(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage, arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements.\n\n(3) Any property or comprehensive general liability insurance carried by the association may contain a deductible provision.\n\n(b) Units having horizontal boundaries.--In the case of a building containing units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, that insurance described in subsection (a)(1), to the extent reasonably available, shall include the units but need not include improvements and betterments installed by unit owners.\n\n(c) Other insurance carried by association.--If the insurance described in subsections (a) and (b) is not maintained, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to all unit owners. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance. The association may carry any other insurance in such reasonable amounts and with such reasonable deductibles as the executive board may deem appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.\n\n(d) Policy terms.--Insurance policies carried under subsections (a) and (b) shall provide all of the following:\n\n(1) Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his membership in the association.\n\n(2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or member of the owner's household.\n\n(3) No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy.\n\n(4) If at the time of a loss under the policy there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy is primary insurance not contributing with the other insurance.\n\n(e) Proceeds from property insurance.--Any loss covered by the property policy under subsections (a)(1) and (b) shall be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss shall be payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (h), the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged common elements and units, and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the common elements and units have been completely repaired or restored or the planned community is terminated.\n\n(f) Unit owner insurance.--A unit owner may insure his unit for all losses to his unit, including losses not covered by the insurance maintained by the association due to a deductible provision or otherwise. A residential unit owner shall insure the owner's unit except as insurance is provided by the association in accordance with this section or the declaration. An insurance policy issued to the association shall not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the owner's own benefit, including, but not limited to, insurance to cover any deductibles or losses not covered by the association's property or comprehensive general liability insurance.\n\n(g) Evidence and cancellation of insurance.--An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon request, to any unit owner, mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance may not be canceled until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued.\n\n(h) Disposition of insurance proceeds.--\n\n(1) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the association by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless:\n\n(i) the planned community is terminated;\n\n(ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or\n\n(iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.\n\nExcept for the costs of repair or replacement which are not covered due to deductibles, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves, which have not been identified by the executive board to fund costs of capital expenditures budgeted for the current fiscal year of the association, is a common expense.\n\n(2) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the unit owner by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the unit owner unless:\n\n(i) the planned community is terminated;\n\n(ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or\n\n(iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote to not rebuild.\n\nThe cost of repair or replacement of these portions in excess of insurance proceeds is the unit owner's expense.\n\n(3) If the entire planned community is not repaired or replaced, the following apply:\n\n(i) The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the planned community.\n\n(ii) The insurance proceeds attributable to units shall be paid to unit owners except those proceeds attributable to controlled facilities for which insurance is separately maintained by the association under this section or the declaration shall be distributed to all unit owners in proportion to their common expense liability. Proceeds attributable to limited common facilities which are not rebuilt shall be distributed equally to owners of units to which those limited common facilities were assigned.\n\n(iii) The remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners in proportion to their common expense liability.\n\n(4) If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's votes in the association and common expense liability are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under section 5107(a) (relating to eminent domain), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, section 5220 (relating to termination of planned community) governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the planned community is terminated.\n\n(i) Nonresidential planned communities.--The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a planned community all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use.\n\n(j) Recovery of deductibles.--If any insurance policy maintained by the association contains a deductible, then that portion of any loss or claim which is not covered by insurance due to the application of a deductible, as well as any claim or loss for which the association is self-insured, shall be levied by the executive board in accordance with section 5314(c) (relating to assessments for common expenses).\n\n(Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1486, No.189, eff. 60 days)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 189 amended subsecs.
