      "text": "(a) Powers and fiduciary status.--Except as provided in the declaration, in the bylaws, in subsection (b) or in other provisions of this subpart, the executive board may act in all instances on behalf of the association. In the performance of their duties, the officers and members of the executive board shall stand in a fiduciary relation to the association and shall perform their duties, including duties as members of any committee of the board upon which they may serve, in good faith; in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the association; and with care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances. In managing the association's reserve funds, the officers and members of the executive board shall have the power to invest the association's reserve funds in investments permissible by law for the investment of trust funds and shall be governed in the management of the association's reserve funds by 20 Pa.C.S. § 7203 (relating to prudent investor rule).

The executive board and its members shall have no liability for exercising these powers provided they are exercised in good faith, in the best interest of the association and with care in the manner set forth in this section.\n\n(b) Limitation on authority.--The executive board may not act on behalf of the association to amend the declaration under section 5219 (relating to amendment of declaration), to terminate the planned community under section 5220 (relating to termination of planned community) or to elect members of the executive board or determine the qualifications, powers and duties or terms of office of executive board members under subsection (e), but the executive board may fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired portion of any term.

In that event the declarant may require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association or executive board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become effective.\n\n(d) Election of members during transfer of declarant control.--Not later than 60 days after conveyance of 25% of the units which may be created to unit owners other than a declarant, at least one member and not less than 25% of the members of the executive board shall be elected by unit owners other than the declarant. Not later than 60 days after conveyance of 50% of the units which may be created to unit owners other than a declarant, not less than 33% of the members of the executive board shall be elected by unit owners other than the declarant.\n\n(e) Election of members and officers following declarant control.--\n\n(1) Not later than the termination of any period of declarant control, the unit owners shall elect an executive board of at least three members, at least a majority of whom shall be unit owners, provided that the executive board may consist of two members, both of whom shall be unit owners, if the planned community consists of two units. The executive board shall elect the officers. The executive board members and officers shall take office upon election.\n\n(2) In the event that the election of the executive board by the unit owners fails to take place not later than the termination of a period of declarant control as provided in this section, then a special meeting of the unit owners may be called for such purpose by any member of the executive board elected by the unit owners or, if there is no such member of the executive board, unit owners entitled to cast at least 10% of the votes in the association.\n\n(f) Removal of members.--Notwithstanding any provision of the declaration or bylaws to the contrary, the unit owners, by a two-thirds vote of all persons present and entitled to vote at any meeting of the unit owners at which a quorum is present, may remove any member of the executive board with or without cause, other than a member appointed by the declarant.\n\n(Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1486, No.189, eff. 60 days; Oct. 19, 2018, P.L.551, No.84, eff. 60 days)\n\n2018 Amendment.Act 84 amended subsec.

The instrument is not effective unless executed by the transferee.\n\n(b) Liability of declarant following transfer.--Upon transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant is as follows:\n\n(1) A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed on a declarant by this subpart. Lack of privity does not deprive any unit owner of standing to bring an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor.\n\n(2) If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the transferor is jointly and severally liable with any successor for any obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to the planned community.\n\n(3) If a transferor retains any special declarant rights but transfers one or more other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant by this subpart or by the declaration relating to the retained special declarant rights and arising after the transfer.\n\n(4) A transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor and to whom the special declarant right has not previously been assigned.\n\n(c) Rights of purchaser in foreclosure, etc., proceedings.--Unless otherwise provided in a mortgage instrument or deed of trust, in case of mortgage foreclosure, tax sale, judicial sale, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or sale under 11 U.S.C. (relating to bankruptcy) or under receivership proceedings of any units owned by a declarant or real estate in a planned community subject to development rights, a person acquiring title to all the real estate being foreclosed or sold, but only upon his request, succeeds to all special declarant rights related to that real estate held by that declarant or only to any rights reserved in the declaration under section 5217 (relating to declarant offices, models and signs) and held by that declarant to maintain models, sales offices and signs. The judgment or instrument conveying title shall provide for transfer of only the special declarant rights requested.\n\n(d) Rights of declarant following foreclosure, etc.--Upon foreclosure, tax sale, judicial sale, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or sale under 11 U.S.C. or under receivership or similar proceedings of all units and other real estate in a planned community owned by a declarant:\n\n(1) the declarant ceases to have any special declarant rights; and\n\n(2) the period of declarant control under section 5303(d) (relating to executive board members and officers) terminates unless the judgment or instrument conveying title provides for transfer of all special declarant rights held by that declarant to a successor declarant.\n\n(e) Liabilities and obligations of successors.--The liabilities and obligations of persons who succeed to special declarant rights are as follows:\n\n(1) A successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this subpart or by the declaration.\n\n(2) A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in paragraph (3) or (4), who is not an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed by this subpart or the declaration on any of the following:\n\n(i) A declarant insofar as the obligation or liability relates to the exercise or nonexercise of special declarant rights.\n\n(ii) The successor's transferor, other than any of the following:\n\n(A) Misrepresentations by any previous declarant except to the extent knowingly continued or permitted to continue without correcting such misrepresentations.\n\n(B) Warranty obligations on improvements made by any previous declarant or made before the planned community was created.\n\n(C) Breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or such declarant's appointees to the executive board.\n\n(D) Any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or omissions after the transfer.\n\n(3) A successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices and signs under section 5217, if the successor is not an affiliate of a declarant, may not exercise any other special declarant right and is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant except the obligation to provide a public offering statement and any liability arising as a result thereof.\n\n(4) A successor to all special declarant rights held by his transferor who is not an affiliate of that transferor declarant and who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a judgment or instrument conveying title to units or an instrument conveying solely special declarant rights under subsection (c) may declare his intention to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, until transferring all special declarant rights to any person acquiring title to any unit owned by the successor or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by his transferor to control the executive board in accordance with the provisions of section 5303(d) for the duration of any period of declarant control; and any attempted exercise of those rights is void. As long as a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under this paragraph, the successor is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant other than liability for his acts and omissions under section 5303(d).\n\n(f) Limitation on liability of successor.--Nothing in this section subjects any successor to a special declarant right to any claims against or other obligations of a transferor declarant other than claims and obligations arising under this subpart or the declaration.\n\nCross References.Section 5304 is referred to in section 5103 of this title.",

If the owner of a unit is a trust, the trustee or trustees shall be deemed to be the owner for voting purposes. If the ownership of a unit is in more than one person, the natural person who shall be entitled to cast the vote of the unit shall be the person named in a certificate executed by all of the owners of the unit and filed with the secretary of the association or, in the absence of that named person from the meeting or in the event of failure to execute and file such a certificate, the person owning such unit who is present. If more than one of the multiple owners are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with their unanimous agreement unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There shall be deemed to be unanimous agreement if any one of the multiple owners casts the votes allocated to that unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other owners of the unit. Such a certificate shall be valid until revoked by a subsequent certificate similarly executed. Except where execution by owners of a unit in the same manner as a deed is required in this subpart and subject to the provisions of the declaration and bylaws, wherever the approval or disapproval of a unit owner is required by this subpart, the declaration or the bylaws, the approval or disapproval shall be made only by the person who would be entitled to cast the vote of the unit at any meeting of the association.\n\n(b) Proxies.--Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a proxy duly executed by a unit owner. If a unit is owned by more than one person, each owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy. A unit owner may not revoke a proxy given under this section except by actual notice of revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the association. A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice. A proxy terminates one year after its date unless it specifies a shorter term.\n\n(c) Voting by lessees.--If the declaration requires that votes on specified matters affecting the planned community be cast by lessees rather than unit owners of leased units, all of the following apply:\n\n(1) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) apply to lessees as if they were unit owners.\n\n(2) Unit owners who have leased their units to other persons may not cast votes on those specified matters.\n\n(3) Lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records and other rights respecting those matters as if they were unit owners.\n\nUnit owners shall also be given notice, in the manner provided in section 5308 (relating to meetings), of all meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.\n\n(d) Units owned by association.--No votes allocated to a unit owned by the association may be cast.\n\n(e) Approved methods of voting.--Methods of voting shall be in accordance with the following:\n\n(1) Except to the extent expressly prohibited in an association's declaration or bylaws, the voting rights of a unit owner may be cast or given in the following ways:\n\n(i) in person or by proxy at a meeting of the association;\n\n(ii) by absentee or electronic ballot in accordance with this subpart; or\n\n(iii) by another method of voting expressly provided in the association's declaration or bylaws.\n\n(2) An absentee or electronic ballot may:\n\n(i) Be counted as a unit owner present and voting for the purpose of establishing a quorum, and otherwise, only for agenda items appearing on the ballot.\n\n(ii) Not be counted even if properly delivered, if the unit owner attends the meeting to vote in person. A vote cast at a meeting by a unit owner supersedes a vote submitted by absentee or electronic ballot previously submitted for that agenda item.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"electronic ballot\" means a ballot cast or given by electronic transmission over the Internet, vote management system or the association's community network, whether by direct connection, intranet, telecopier, electronic mail or other technological means, if the identity of the unit owner submitting the ballot can be confirmed and a receipt of the electronic transmission and ballot can be made available to the unit owner.\n\n(f) Acclamation.--Unless the bylaws of the association provide otherwise, in the event that an election for a position on the executive board is uncontested, the officer or chair presiding at the election meeting may declare the nominee elected by acclamation after determining there are no further nominations.\n\n(Nov. 3, 2022, P.L.1750, No.115, eff. 180 days)\n\n2022 Amendment.Act 115 added subsecs.

The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies.\n\n(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage, arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements.\n\n(3) Any property or comprehensive general liability insurance carried by the association may contain a deductible provision.\n\n(b) Units having horizontal boundaries.--In the case of a building containing units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, that insurance described in subsection (a)(1), to the extent reasonably available, shall include the units but need not include improvements and betterments installed by unit owners.\n\n(c) Other insurance carried by association.--If the insurance described in subsections (a) and (b) is not maintained, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to all unit owners.

The association may carry any other insurance in such reasonable amounts and with such reasonable deductibles as the executive board may deem appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.\n\n(d) Policy terms.--Insurance policies carried under subsections (a) and (b) shall provide all of the following:\n\n(1) Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his membership in the association.\n\n(2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or member of the owner's household.\n\n(3) No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy.\n\n(4) If at the time of a loss under the policy there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy is primary insurance not contributing with the other insurance.\n\n(e) Proceeds from property insurance.--Any loss covered by the property policy under subsections (a)(1) and (b) shall be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss shall be payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear.

A residential unit owner shall insure the owner's unit except as insurance is provided by the association in accordance with this section or the declaration. An insurance policy issued to the association shall not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the owner's own benefit, including, but not limited to, insurance to cover any deductibles or losses not covered by the association's property or comprehensive general liability insurance.\n\n(g) Evidence and cancellation of insurance.--An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon request, to any unit owner, mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance may not be canceled until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued.\n\n(h) Disposition of insurance proceeds.--\n\n(1) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the association by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless:\n\n(i) the planned community is terminated;\n\n(ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or\n\n(iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.\n\nExcept for the costs of repair or replacement which are not covered due to deductibles, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves, which have not been identified by the executive board to fund costs of capital expenditures budgeted for the current fiscal year of the association, is a common expense.\n\n(2) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the unit owner by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the unit owner unless:\n\n(i) the planned community is terminated;\n\n(ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or\n\n(iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote to not rebuild.\n\nThe cost of repair or replacement of these portions in excess of insurance proceeds is the unit owner's expense.\n\n(3) If the entire planned community is not repaired or replaced, the following apply:\n\n(i) The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the planned community.\n\n(ii) The insurance proceeds attributable to units shall be paid to unit owners except those proceeds attributable to controlled facilities for which insurance is separately maintained by the association under this section or the declaration shall be distributed to all unit owners in proportion to their common expense liability.

The amount of the payment shall be proportionate to the ratio which that unit owner's common expense liability bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the lien.
