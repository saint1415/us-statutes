The declaration shall specify how votes in the association shall be allocated among the units and may provide:\n\n(i) for different allocations of votes among units on particular matters specified in the declaration; and\n\n(ii) for class voting on specified issues affecting a particular class of units if necessary to protect the valid interests of the owners of such units and not affecting units outside of the class.\n\n(2) Cumulative voting shall only be permitted if so provided expressly in the declaration and only for the purpose of electing members of the executive board.

The common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which it is allocated is void.\n\n(e) Calculations for undivided interests.--Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the common expense liabilities allocated at any time to all the units must equal one if stated as a fraction or 100% if stated as percentages. If there is a discrepancy between the allocated common expense liability and the result derived from application of the formulas, the allocated common expense liability prevails.\n\nCross References.Section 5208 is referred to in sections 5103, 5107, 5205, 5311 of this title.",

The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the planned community are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.\n\n(b) Execution and recording agreement and ratifications.--An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution or ratification of a termination agreement, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners who are owners of record as of the date preceding the date of recording of the termination agreement. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a unit owner. The termination agreement shall become void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of the expiration of one year from the date it was first executed and ratified by a unit owner or such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the planned community is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and shall be indexed in the name of the planned community in both the grantor and grantee index.

Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (f). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the owner's unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this subpart or the declaration.\n\n(d) Nonsale upon termination.--If the real estate constituting the planned community is not to be sold following termination, title to the common facilities and, in a planned community containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the planned community vest in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (f), and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the owner's unit.\n\n(e) Proceeds of sale.--Following termination of the planned community, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units which were recorded, filed of public record or otherwise perfected before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.\n\n(f) Respective interests of unit owners.--The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (c), (d) and (e) are as follows:\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units and limited common elements immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements.\n\n(2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common expense liabilities immediately before the termination.\n\n(g) Effect of foreclosure or enforcement of lien.--Except as provided in subsection (h), foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire planned community does not of itself terminate the planned community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the planned community does not of itself withdraw that portion from the planned community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the planned community, but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the planned community.\n\n(h) Exclusion from planned community upon foreclosure.--If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the planned community has priority over the declaration and if the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the planned community.\n\n(i) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.--In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the planned community other than a provision for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the planned community would otherwise be terminated, owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.\n\n(Nov. 30, 2004, P.L.1486, No.189, eff. 60 days)\n\n2004 Amendment.Act 189 added subsec.

      "text": "(a) Applicability of section.--If the declaration for a planned community provides that any of the powers described in section 5302 (relating to power of unit owners' association) with respect to the planned community are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association (a \"master association\") which exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more other planned communities or other incorporated or unincorporated associations, then, except as modified by this section, all provisions of this subpart applicable to unit owners' associations shall apply to any such master association insofar as its actions affect the planned community.\n\n(b) Powers.--Unless a master association is acting in the capacity of an association described in section 5301 (relating to organization of unit owners' association) with respect to a planned community which is part of the master association, it may exercise with respect to the planned community only such powers set forth in section 5302 and only to the extent expressly permitted in the declaration which provides for the delegation of powers from its planned community association to the master association and accepted by the master association, as indicated in the provisions of the declaration or other organizational documents of the master association.\n\n(c) Liability of executive board members and officers.--If the declaration of a planned community provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board have no liability for the acts or omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following delegation. The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the planned community association whose powers are delegated to the master association and the unit owners of the planned community on the same basis as officers and executive board members of the planned community immediately before such delegation of powers.\n\n(d) Rights and responsibilities of persons electing governing body.--The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners' association set forth in sections 5302, 5303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 5309 (relating to quorums), 5310 (relating to voting; proxies) and 5320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association with respect to the exercise of powers elected pursuant to a planned community declaration to the master association, but apply only to those persons who elect the governing body of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this subpart.\n\n(e) Election of master association governing body.--Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5303(e) with respect to the election of the executive board by all unit owners after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 5301, the instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each planned community of the organizational documents of other associations, the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association, shall provide that the governing body of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways:\n\n(1) All unit owners of all planned communities and other properties subject to the master association elect all members of the governing body of the master association.\n\n(2) All members of the governing bodies of the planned community associations and other property owners' associations subject to the master association elect all members of the master association governing body.\n\n(3) All unit owners of each planned community and other property owners' association subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body.\n\n(4) All members of the governing bodies of the planned communities and other property associations subject to the master association elect specified members of the master association governing body.\n\n(e.1) Independent reviewer.--The instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each planned community of the organizational documents of other associations, the powers of which are assigned pursuant to the declaration or organizational documents or delegated to the master association, shall also provide that a vote by a unit owner in an election of the members of the master association governing body must be submitted by the unit owner to an independent reviewer who shall tally the results of the election and certify the results to the executive board and unit owner. In order to be eligible to vote in the election, a unit owner shall be in good standing with the association. The executive board shall present the official election results based on the certified election report from the independent reviewer at a meeting of the unit owners and shall enter the results in the meeting records. All votes by unit owners under this subsection shall be submitted to the independent reviewer in accordance with the approved methods of voting as provided under this subpart. This subsection shall only apply to a planned community with at least 500 units. If a planned community has less than 500 units, the master association may opt in to the requirements under this subsection by a vote of at least 51% of the votes collected from the unit owners in person, electronically or by absentee ballot which are in favor of the requirements under this subsection.\n\n(f) Delegation of responsibility and authority.--The provisions of this section shall apply to a planned community upon any of the following:\n\n(1) A date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the planned community.\n\n(2) An event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that:\n\n(i) the event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the planned community; and\n\n(ii) a copy of such instrument has been sent to all unit owners.\n\n(3) The declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the planned community and that a copy of such instrument has been sent to the executive board and all unit owners. This paragraph shall be applicable only if the declarant shall have expressly reserved in the declaration, under section 5205(13) (relating to contents of declaration; all planned communities), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the planned community and only if the instrument exercising such right has been recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right.\n\n(g) Delegation of all powers.--If all of the powers of a planned community association are delegated to a master association and accepted by the master association under subsection (b), then the governing body of the master association may act in all respects as the executive board of the planned community, and no separate executive board need be elected or exist.\n\n(Nov. 3, 2022, P.L.1750, No.115, eff. 180 days)\n\n2022 Amendment.Act 115 added subsec.

      "text": "(a) General rule.--Any two or more planned communities by agreement of the unit owners as provided in subsection (b) may be merged or consolidated into a single planned community. In the event of a merger or consolidation, unless the agreement otherwise provides, the resultant planned community is, for all purposes, the legal successor of all of the preexisting planned communities, and the operations and activities of all associations of the preexisting planned communities shall be merged or consolidated into a single association which shall hold all powers, rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of all preexisting associations. The resultant planned community shall, in addition, be subject in all respects to the provisions and requirements of this subpart regardless of whether or not any of the preexisting planned communities have been established under this subpart.\n\n(b) Requirements of agreement.--The merger or consolidation of two or more planned communities under subsection (a) must be evidenced by a recorded agreement duly executed by the president of the association of each of the preexisting planned communities following approval by owners of units to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each planned community required to terminate such planned community. Any such agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the planned community is located and is not effective until so recorded.\n\n(c) Reallocations.--\n\n(1) Every merger or consolidation agreement must provide for the reallocation of the common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association among the units of the resulting planned community in one of the following manners:\n\n(i) by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based; or\n\n(ii) by stating the common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the resulting association which are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting planned communities, and providing that the common expense liability, including both general and limited common expenses, and portion of the votes in the association for the resulting planned community shall be the same as was allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting planned community by the declaration of the preexisting planned community.\n\n(d) Action by declarant.--Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), if a declarant shall have expressly retained the special declarant right to merge or consolidate a planned community under section 5205(14) (relating to contents of declaration; all planned communities) and if the declarant shall have exercised such right within the time period allowed for such exercise by giving written notice to that effect to all unit owners accompanied by a copy of the agreement evidencing such merger or consolidation, then such agreement may be executed by the declarant rather than by the president of the association of that planned community and without the necessity for approval or consent by unit owners or their mortgagees, provided that the agreement is recorded within the time period allowed for the exercise of this special declarant right.\n\nCross References.Section 5223 is referred to in sections 5102, 5103, 5205 of this title.",
