      "text": "The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:\n\n(1) Since fish at large in the waters of this Commonwealth are a natural resource, protection and conservation of this resource in the public interest is the obligation of the Commonwealth.\n\n(2) The shad which inhabit the waters of the Delaware River system constitute a potentially valuable source of food and raw materials and, under proper management, are capable of producing a constant and abundant harvest without depletion of the species and consequent shortages of supply. The important shad fishery of the Delaware River has been depleted so that the actual harvest is far below the potential yield of this resource which at one time yielded as much as 16,000,000 fish yearly but in recent years has yielded only a few hundred thousand pounds. This depletion has caused a denial to the consuming public of a constant and adequate supply of these vitamin rich foods within a reasonable price range that consistent and abundant supply would make possible, and has caused decline and instability in the fishing industry in this river system. The restoration of this species in the Delaware River has become an enterprise of vast economic importance to this Commonwealth.\n\n(3) It is a matter of public interest and for the public welfare and health for the Commonwealth to take such measures as are necessary to control the intensity of fishing pressure in order that the restoration of this valuable species may be accomplished and that the species may attain the maximum sustained yield consistent with the preservation of an adequate brood stock. Legislative limitation of the size of the mesh of nets, size limits and other like measures are not effective in conserving this species.\n\n(4) In accordance with the purposes of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Compact to which this Commonwealth is a party and in order to carry out the policy of the Commonwealth as it relates to the shad inhabiting the waters of the Delaware River and in order to restore this depleted fishery, it is necessary, proper and expedient to establish a system of licensing designed to control increases in the intensity of fishing pressure so that increases in fishing pressure will be brought into balance with the population of shad in the Delaware, to the end that the shad fisheries of the waters of the Delaware River and its tributaries will be restored and will produce the maximum sustained yield consistent with the conservation of that species. Since the stabilization of fishing operations is an activity promoting the public interest, the payment of license fees and the imposing and controlling of the restrictive provisions of this chapter upon the general public is an equitable contribution on its part arising from the privileges of harvesting this natural resource.",

The commission may enter into such administrative agreements with the pertinent administrative officials of any of the other states enumerated in subsection (a) as may be necessary to establish a joint limitation of licenses and such cooperative programs as may be deemed necessary for the re-establishment of the shad fishery of the Delaware River and Bay and their tributaries in such manner as to promote the maximum sustained annual yield therefrom.\n\n(c) Notice of proposed additional licenses.--When additional units of gear are to be licensed, the executive director shall give public notice, by advertisement once a week for two successive weeks in at least two daily newspapers of the counties of the state bordering on the Delaware River, of the additional units of gear to be licensed and the areas where they may be operated, and shall state that applications may be received up to January 1 next succeeding the publication of the notice.\n\n(d) Grounds for refusing license.--The executive director may decline to receive any application for an additional license when, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, he finds that the applicant is not qualified by character, experience, financial responsibility and equipment to conduct properly the fishing operation applied for, or when, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, he finds that it is necessary, in order to maintain the stability of the industry or prevent conditions leading to monopoly, to prefer the applications of new operators over the extension of the operations of previous licenses, or, in the licensing of extended operations, to prefer small over large operators.\n\n(e) Time and method of issuance.--On January 1 of each year, the commission shall issue such additional licenses as may be authorized for that year under the provisions of this section, the recipients of such licenses and the locations of fixed nets to be chosen by lot from among the applications received whenever there are more applicants than available licenses or more than one applicant for any location.\n\nCross References.Section 7308 is referred to in section 7312 of this title.",
