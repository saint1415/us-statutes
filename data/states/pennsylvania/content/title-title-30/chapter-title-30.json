      "text": "§ 5312. Insurance. (a) Insurance to be carried by association.-- Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available, all of the following: (1) Property insurance on the common facilities and controlled facilities to the extent the controlled facilities can be insured separately from the unit and, if insurance for the unit is not provided by the association under subsection (b) or the declaration, insuring against all common risks of direct physical loss. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies. (2) Comprehensive general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage, arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements. (3) Any property or comprehensive general liability insurance carried by the association may contain a deductible provision. (b) Units having horizontal boundaries.-- In the case of a building containing units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, that insurance described in subsection (a)(1), to the extent reasonably available, shall include the units but need not include improvements and betterments installed by unit owners. (c) Other insurance carried by association.-- If the insurance described in subsections (a) and (b) is not maintained, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to all unit owners. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance. The association may carry any other insurance in such reasonable amounts and with such reasonable deductibles as the executive board may deem appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners. (d) Policy terms.-- Insurance policies carried under subsections (a) and (b) shall provide all of the following: (1) Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his membership in the association. (2) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or member of the owner's household. (3) No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy. (4) If at the time of a loss under the policy there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy is primary insurance not contributing with the other insurance. (e) Proceeds from property insurance.-- Any loss covered by the property policy under subsections (a)(1) and (b) shall be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss shall be payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (h), the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged common elements and units, and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the common elements and units have been completely repaired or restored or the planned community is terminated. (f) Unit owner insurance.-- A unit owner may insure his unit for all losses to his unit, including losses not covered by the insurance maintained by the association due to a deductible provision or otherwise. A residential unit owner shall insure the owner's unit except as insurance is provided by the association in accordance with this section or the declaration. An insurance policy issued to the association shall not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the owner's own benefit, including, but not limited to, insurance to cover any deductibles or losses not covered by the association's property or comprehensive general liability insurance. (g) Evidence and cancellation of insurance.-- An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon request, to any unit owner, mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance may not be canceled until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued. (h) Disposition of insurance proceeds.-- (1) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the association by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless: (i) the planned community is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. Except for the costs of repair or replacement which are not covered due to deductibles, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves, which have not been identified by the executive board to fund costs of capital expenditures budgeted for the current fiscal year of the association, is a common expense. (2) Any portion of the planned community for which insurance is required to be maintained by the unit owner by this section or the declaration and which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the unit owner unless: (i) the planned community is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any State or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote to not rebuild. The cost of repair or replacement of these portions in excess of insurance proceeds is the unit owner's expense. (3) If the entire planned community is not repaired or replaced, the following apply: (i) The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the planned community. (ii) The insurance proceeds attributable to units shall be paid to unit owners except those proceeds attributable to controlled facilities for which insurance is separately maintained by the association under this section or the declaration shall be distributed to all unit owners in proportion to their common expense liability. Proceeds attributable to limited common facilities which are not rebuilt shall be distributed equally to owners of units to which those limited common facilities were assigned. (iii) The remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners in proportion to their common expense liability. (4) If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's votes in the association and common expense liability are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under section 5107(a) (relating to eminent domain), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, section 5220 (relating to termination of planned community) governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the planned community is terminated. (i) Nonresidential planned communities.-- The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a planned community all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use. (j) Recovery of deductibles.-- If any insurance policy maintained by the association contains a deductible, then that portion of any loss or claim which is not covered by insurance due to the application of a deductible, as well as any claim or loss for which the association is self-insured, shall be levied by the executive board in accordance with section 5314(c) (relating to assessments for common expenses).

(b) Return to normal operation.-- The commission may, upon its own motion or upon complaint, order a public utility to return an electric generating unit to normal operation if the commission determines that it would be more cost effective for the utility's ratepayers if the unit were to be returned to normal operation, with or without capital additions or operating improvements, than if the utility were to implement its plan for providing the power which the unit is, or could be made, capable of producing. (c) Procedure.-- The commission may hold such hearings as it deems necessary in making the determinations required by subsection (a) or (b).

(e) Exclusion.-- This section shall not apply to a nuclear generating unit or to variations in operation of electric generating units to satisfy economic dispatch requirements or to maintain intrasystem or intersystem stability. (f) Construction costs.-- Notwithstanding section 1315 (relating to limitation on consideration of certain costs for electric utilities) and subject to regulations promulgated by the commission, the commission may allow a portion of the prudently incurred costs of capital additions, determined on a per megawatt basis and not to exceed 50% of the unit's undepreciated original cost per megawatt, to an electric generating unit to be made a part of the rate base or otherwise included in the rates charged by the utility before such capital additions are completed if the commission, acting pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), prohibits the utility from retiring the unit or orders the utility to return the unit to normal operation, provided that: (1) the capital additions would allow the continued or increased use of coal mined in Pennsylvania; and (2) the capital additions would be more cost effective for the utility's ratepayers than other alternatives for meeting the utility's load and capacity requirements. Notwithstanding section 1309 (relating to rates fixed on complaint; investigation of costs of production), the commission, by regulation, shall provide for a utility to remove the costs of capital additions from its rate base and to refund any revenues collected as the result of this subsection, plus interest, which shall be the average rate of interest specified for residential mortgage lending by the Secretary of Banking in accordance with the act of January 30, 1974 (P.L.13, No.6), referred to as the Loan Interest and Protection Law, during the period or periods for which the commission orders refunds, if the commission, after notice and hearing, determines that the capital addition has not been completed within a reasonable time. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section the term \"normal operation\" means the continuing availability of an electric generating unit to meet consumer demand except during: (1) Scheduled outages for repairs, tests or other procedures essential to the unit's further use. (2) Unscheduled outages caused by the unit's physical malfunctioning or breakdown. (3) Reduced levels of generation pending execution of repairs. (4) Reduced levels or complete cessation of generation, on a temporary basis, because of disruptions in fuel supplies, waste disposal or cooling water; or because of compliance with environmental protection limitations or conservation of fuel during periods of, or in anticipation of, scarcity.

(e) Procedure for selection committees.-- The selection committees shall use the procedure set forth in this subsection: (1) The committee shall give public notice of projects requiring design services and publicly recommend to the purchasing agency three qualified design professionals for each project. (2) If desired, the committee may conduct discussions with three or more professionals regarding anticipated design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment. The committee shall select, based upon criteria established by the head of the purchasing agency, no less than three design professionals deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. In exercising its responsibility, the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) An equitable distribution of contracts to design professionals. (ii) Particular capability to perform the design or construction services for the contract being considered. (iii) Geographic proximity of the design professional to the proposed facility. (iv) The design professional selected has the necessary available personnel to perform the services required by the project. (v) Any other relevant circumstances peculiar to the proposed contract. (f) Design professionals.-- Except as provided for in subsection (g), the head of the purchasing agency shall select design professionals as follows: (1) Where the amount of the base construction allocation is less than $20,000,000, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The fee to be paid to the appointed design professional may be established by the selection committee or may be negotiated at the discretion of the head of the purchasing agency. The $20,000,000 threshold shall be adjusted by the department to reflect the annual percentage change in the Composite Construction Cost Index of the United States Department of Commerce occurring in the one-year period ending December 31 each year. (2) Where the amount of base construction allocation is in excess of or equal to $20,000,000, as annually adjusted, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee to begin contract negotiations. The fee to be paid to the design professional and the terms of the contract between the design professional and the department shall be negotiated by the head of the purchasing agency. In negotiating the contract and the fee, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, uniqueness and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the appointed design professional, negotiations with that design professional shall be terminated, and the head of the purchasing agency shall commence negotiations with one of the other firms chosen by the selection committee. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the second firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall terminate negotiations with the second design professional and commence negotiation with the third firm. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall choose additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this subsection until an agreement is reached. (g) Selection method for Department of Transportation, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Protection and State-affiliated entities.-- In the event the Department of Transportation, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection or a State-affiliated entity otherwise authorized by law to use its own selection committee requires the services of a design professional, the head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall negotiate with the firm determined to be the highest qualified firm for design professional services at a fee which is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth. In making this decision, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee he determines to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The head of the purchasing agency shall then undertake negotiations with the firm he determines to be the second highest qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the third highest qualified firm. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the committee shall select additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service credit in that county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous county employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer, by the member, county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's county or municipal pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the county or municipal pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by December 31, 1987, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by December 31, 1987.

Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service in accordance with county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system benefit provisions, multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members. The Public Employee Retirement Study Commission shall determine the appropriate amount of employer contributions to be transferred to the system by the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems. (2) If the member died prior to the effective date of this subsection, the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1). In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by December 31, 1987. If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before January 1, 1988, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by March 31, 1988. If the member dies after December 31, 1987, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), neither the member or his estate shall receive credit for the prior service.

(2) The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service in the \"predecessor corporation\" transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, the provisions of section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer by the member or the \"predecessor corporation\" to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the member's pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by June 30, 1992, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the \"predecessor corporation\" pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by June 30, 1992. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall pay as pick-up contributions the difference between the amount credited to the member's account and the amount otherwise due under section 5504. Such additional contributions paid by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall not be considered compensation for the purposes of this part. If the amount transferred to the system by the member is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members so long as the amount to be transferred is equal to or less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee. In the event that the amount required to be transferred is greater than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee shall be transferred to the system, and the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system the additional funds needed to satisfy the requirements of the calculation in this paragraph. If the amount required to be transferred is less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority may retain the amount not needed for transfer. (3) If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before July 1, 1992, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or may request that the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by September 30, 1992.

(3) Contributions to be paid by an active member for credit for New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be sufficient to provide an amount equal to the regular and additional accumulated deductions which would have been standing to the credit of the member for such service had regular and additional member contributions been made to the board with full coverage as a Class A member during the period of New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and had these regular and additional accumulated deductions been credited with statutory interest up to the date of purchase. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account.

(a) Action authorized.-- An action to enjoin or abate a violation of this chapter may be brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by the Attorney General, the district attorney of the county concerned or the solicitor of the municipality in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. The action shall be brought and tried as an action in equity in the court of common pleas of the county in which the adult-oriented establishment is located. (b) Procedure.-- (1) If it is made to appear, by affidavits or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court that a violation exists, a temporary writ of injunction shall forthwith issue, directed to the operator of the adult entertainment establishment or the owner of the premises, or both, restraining the operator or owner from continuing or permitting the continuation of any violation or violations of this chapter until the conclusion of the hearing and a decision by the court. No bond shall be required in instituting such proceedings. This chapter, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity. (2) It shall not be necessary for the court to find the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but, on finding that the material allegations of the petition are true, the court shall order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises be used in violation of this chapter. Upon judgment of the court ordering the violations to be abated, the court may order that neither the premises nor any part of the premises shall be occupied or used for any purpose for up to one year following the date of the court's order, but the court may, in its discretion, permit the premises to be occupied or used by the operator or owner if the operator or owner, or both, posts a bond or a joint bond in the discretion of the court with sufficient surety to be approved by the court in the penal and liquidated sum of not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500, payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and conditioned that neither the building nor a part of the building be used in violation of this chapter and that the operator will pay all fines, costs and damages that may be assessed for any violation of this chapter upon the premises. (3) Service of any preliminary or permanent injunction shall be made personally upon the operator and owner of the premises if such persons can be found in the county. If the operator or owner cannot be found, a copy of the order shall be delivered to any employee of the operator on the establishment premises or, in the case of the owner, upon an agent, if any. If no employee or agent can be found or service cannot be made on an employee or agent of the owner, then service shall be made as the court may direct. Any person other than the operator or owner who shall be served with any notice of an injunction shall within 24 hours thereafter deliver the notice to the operator or owner, as the case may be, or mail it to the operator or owner by registered mail if the address of the operator or owner, as the case may be, is known to the person served. Suspension by Court Order. Subsec. (b)(1) was suspended July 31, 1997, S.Ct. Order, to the extent that section 5506(b)(1) provides that Chapter 55, insofar as it provides for methods of service and bond, shall not be deemed to be suspended or affected by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing the action in equity.",

(a) Amount of annuity.-- A member who has made application for a disability annuity and has been found to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of section 5905(c)(1) (relating to duties of the board regarding applications and elections of members and participants) shall receive a disability annuity payable from the effective date of disability as determined by the board and continued until a subsequent determination by the board that the annuitant is no longer entitled to a disability annuity. If the sum of the products of the number of years and fractional part of a year of credited service in each class and the appropriate class of service multiplier is greater than 16.667, the disability annuity shall be a single life annuity that is equal to the sum of the standard single life annuities determined separately for each class of service multiplied by the appropriate class of service multiplier, otherwise each standard single life annuity shall be multiplied by the lesser of the following ratios: MY*/Y or 16.667/Y Where Y = total number of years of credited service; Y* = total years of credited service if the member were to continue as a State employee until attaining superannuation age as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, or if the member has attained superannuation age, as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, then the number of years of credited service and M = the class of service multiplier as applicable to that class of service at the effective date of disability. A member of Class C shall receive, in addition, any annuity to which he may be eligible under section 5702(a)(3) (relating to maximum single life annuity). The member shall be entitled to the election of a joint and survivor annuity on that portion of the disability annuity to which he is entitled under section 5702. (b) Benefit attributable to social security integration credit.-- If the member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and has social security integration credits as provided in section 5305 (relating to social security integration credits), he may elect to withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions or if he has five or more eligibility points to his credit and does not withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions he may execute an application to be filed with the board to receive, in addition to his disability annuity, an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702(a)(2). (c) Reduction on account of earned income.-- Subsequent to January 1, 1972, payments on account of disability shall be reduced by that amount by which the earned income of the annuitant, as reported in accordance with section 5908(b) (relating to rights and duties of annuitants), for the preceding calendar year together with the disability annuity payments provided in this section other than subsection (b), for the year, exceeds the product of: (1) the last year's salary of the annuitant as a member of the system; and (2) the ratio of the current monthly payment to the monthly payment at the effective date of disability; Provided, That the annuitant shall not receive less than his member's annuity or the amount to which he may be entitled under section 5702 whichever is greater. (d) Reduction on account of ineligibility.-- Payment of that portion of the disability annuity in excess of the annuity to which the annuitant was entitled at the effective date of disability calculated in accordance with section 5702 shall cease if the annuitant is no longer eligible under the provisions of sections 5905(c)(2) or 5908(b) or (c). (e) Termination of State service.-- Upon termination of disability annuity payments in excess of an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702, a disability annuitant who does not return to State service may file an application with the board for an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of the shared-risk accumulated deductions plus the regular and additional accumulated deductions standing to his credit at the effective date of disability over one-third of the total disability annuity payments received. If the annuitant on the date of termination of service was eligible for an annuity as provided in section 5308(a) or (b) (relating to eligibility for annuities), he may file an application with the board for an election of an optional modification of his annuity. (1) (Deleted by amendment). (2) (Deleted by amendment). (f) Supplement for service connected disability.-- (1) If a member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and if the disability has been found to be a service connected disability and if the member is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits, such member shall receive a supplement equal to the amount determined under paragraph (2) less the sum of the annuity as determined under subsection (a) and any payments paid or payable on account of such disability under the act of June 2, 1915 (P.L.736, No.338), known as the Workers' Compensation Act, the act of June 21, 1939 (P.L.566, No.284), known as The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act, and the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.). Such supplement shall continue as long as he is determined to be disabled and is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits on account of his service connected disability in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act or The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act. If the member has received a lump sum workers' compensation payment in lieu of future weekly compensation payments, the length in weeks and calculation of the service connected disability supplement shall be determined by dividing the lump sum payment by the average weekly wage as determined by the Workers' Compensation Board. (2) For a member who does not have Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be 70% of the member's final average salary. For a member who has Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be calculated according to the following formula: A = .7[(Y W MULTIPLIED BY FAS W )+(Y P MULTIPLIED BY FAS P )] Y T Y T (3) The following apply to the formula in paragraph (2): (i) A equals the amount used to determine the supplement; (ii) Y T equals total years of credited service; (iii) Y W equals years of credited service that are not Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (iv) FAS W equals final average salary calculated for credited service other than Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (v) Y P equals years of service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; and (vi) FAS P equals final average salary calculated for service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service. (g) Limitation regarding annual benefit under IRC § 415.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this part to the contrary, no benefit shall be payable to the extent that such benefit exceeds any limitation under IRC § 415 as in effect with respect to governmental plans as such term is defined in IRC § 414(d) on the date the benefit payment becomes effective, provided however, that any increase in any limitation under IRC § 415 shall be applicable to all current and future annuitants and survivor annuitants. (h) Coordination of benefits.-- The determination and payment of a disability annuity under this section is in addition to any payments a member may be entitled to receive, has received or is receiving as a result of being a participant in the plan.

      "text": "§ 5706. Termination of annuities. (a) General rule.-- (1) If the annuitant returns to State service or enters or has entered school service and elects multiple service membership, any annuity payable to him under this part shall cease effective upon the date of his return to State service or entering school service without regard to whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member of the system or participant in the plan or, if a multiple service member, whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member or participant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System or School Employees' Defined Contribution Plan; and, in the case of an annuity other than a disability annuity the present value of such annuity, adjusted for full coverage in the case of a joint coverage member who makes the appropriate back contributions for full coverage, shall be frozen as of the date such annuity ceases. An annuitant who is credited with an additional 10% of Class A and Class C service as provided in section 5302(c) (relating to credited State service) and who returns to State service shall forfeit such credited service and shall have his frozen present value adjusted as if his 10% retirement incentive had not been applied to his account. In the event that the cost-of-living increase enacted December 18, 1979 occurred during the period of such State or school employment, the frozen present value shall be increased, on or after the member attains superannuation age, by the percent applicable had he not returned to service. (2) This subsection shall not apply in the case of any annuitant who: (i) may render services to the Commonwealth in the capacity of an independent contractor; or (ii) is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year and who may render service to the Commonwealth: (A) as a member of an independent board or commission or as a member of a departmental administrative or advisory board or commission when such members of independent or departmental boards or commissions are compensated on a per diem basis for not more than 150 days per calendar year; or (B) as a member of an independent board or commission requiring appointment by the Governor, with advice and consent of the Senate, where the annual salary payable to the member does not exceed $35,000 and where the member has been an annuitant for at least six months immediately preceding the appointment. (a.1) Return to State service during emergency.-- When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public, an annuitant who is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year may be returned to State service for a period not to exceed 95 days in any calendar year without loss of his annuity. In computing the number of days an annuitant has returned to State service, any amount of time less than one-half of a day shall be counted as one-half of a day. For agencies, boards and commissions under the Governor's jurisdiction, the approval of the Governor that an emergency exists shall be required before an annuitant may be returned to State service. (a.2) Return of benefits.-- In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 5705 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to State service or entering school service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member or school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid. (a.3) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.-- In the event that a former State employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount so received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board, but not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave, with the repayment period not to exceed five years or such longer time as may be agreed to between the board and the member. (a.4) Return to service as a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of the act of September 30, 1983 (P.L.160, No.39), known as the Public Official Compensation Law, 42 Pa.C.S. (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure) or any other provision of law or rule of court providing for or allowing a member of the judiciary to return to service as a senior judge, senior justice, senior magisterial district judge or in any administrative, fact finding, adjudicative, appellate or other capacity with any court or tribunal or in any other capacity for which compensation is received and to receive such compensation, whether paid on a per diem, hourly, salaried or other basis, in addition to any annuity payable under this part, any such member of the judiciary who returns to State service shall be subject to the provision of this section and section 5301 (relating to mandatory and optional membership) unless that member of the judiciary is over normal retirement age or has been an annuitant for more than one year. (a.5) No contributions or credited service.-- The service of an annuitant whose annuity does not cease upon his return to State or school service shall not be subject to member contributions or eligible for qualification as creditable State service and shall not be eligible for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions, voluntary contributions or employer defined contributions. (b) Subsequent discontinuance of service.-- Upon subsequent discontinuance of service, such terminating State employee other than a former annuitant who had the effect of his frozen present value eliminated in accordance with subsection (c) or a former disability annuitant shall be entitled to an annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the present value as determined under subsection (a) to which shall be added, if the service after reemployment was as a member of the system, the present value of a maximum single life annuity based on years of service credited subsequent to reentry in the system and his final average salary computed by reference to his compensation as a member of the system or as a member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System during his entire period of State and school service. (c) Elimination of the effect of frozen present value.-- (1) An annuitant who returns to State service as an active member of the system and earns three eligibility points as a member of the system by performing credited State service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, or an annuitant who enters school service other than as a Class DC participant and: (i) is a multiple service member; or (ii) who elects multiple service membership, and earns three eligibility points by performing credited State service as a member of the system or credited school service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, and who had the present value of his annuity frozen in accordance with subsection (a), shall qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value resulting from all previous periods of retirement eliminated, provided that all lump sum payments under Option 4 or under section 5705(a.1) and annuity payments payable during previous periods of retirement plus interest as set forth in paragraph (3) shall be returned to the fund in the form of an actuarial adjustment to his subsequent benefits or in such form as the board may otherwise direct. (2) Upon subsequent discontinuance of service and the filing of an application for an annuity, a former annuitant who qualifies to have the effect of a frozen present value eliminated under this subsection shall be entitled to receive the higher of either: (i) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the freezing of the former annuitant's account pursuant to subsection (a) had not occurred, adjusted by crediting Class A State service as Class AA service as provided for in section 5306(a.1) (relating to classes of service) and further adjusted according to paragraph (3), provided that a former annuitant of the system or a former annuitant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System who retired under a provision of law granting additional service credit if termination of State or school service or retirement occurred during a specific period of time shall not be permitted to retain the additional service credit under the prior law when the annuity is computed for his most recent retirement; or (ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value eliminated, unless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity. (3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement.

For purposes of this subsection, a member with Class A-5 service or Class A-6 service who has ten or more eligibility points shall be considered eligible for an annuity based on Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, subject to a reduction factor calculated to provide benefits actuarially equivalent to an annuity starting at superannuation age, even if the member had not attained age 62.

(d) Disability annuitants ineligible for withdrawal annuity.-- In the event of the death of a disability annuitant who was not entitled to receive benefits under subsection (a), his beneficiary shall be paid the excess of the sum of the regular and additional accumulated deductions standing to his credit on the effective date of disability over one-third of the total disability payments received. (e) Annuitants electing maximum single life annuity.-- In the event of the death of an annuitant who has elected to receive the maximum single life annuity before he has received in annuity payments the full amount of the total accumulated deductions standing to his credit on the effective date of retirement, the balance shall be paid to his designated beneficiary.

The Interstate Corrections Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this State with any other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: INTERSTATE CORRECTIONS COMPACT ARTICLE I Purpose and Policy The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had. (c) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had. (d) \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution. (e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including, but not limited to, a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined. ARTICLE III Contracts (a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration. 2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance. 3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any, the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom. 4. Delivery and retaking of inmates. 5. Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states. (b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith. ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights (a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. (b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. (c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III. (d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state. (e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state. (f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. (g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory. (h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state. (i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact. ARTICLE V Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition (a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference. (b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VI Federal Aid Any state party to this compact may accept Federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such Federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provisions, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor. ARTICLE VII Entry into Force This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state. ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact. ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements. ARTICLE X Construction and Severability The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",
