      "text": "(a) General rule.--A credit union may be converted into a Federal credit union by complying with the following requirements:\n\n(1) The proposition for such conversion shall first be approved by a majority vote of the directors of the credit union who shall also set a date for the vote thereon by the members. The vote of the members shall be conducted at a meeting held on such date, or by written ballot if the bylaws so provide to be filed on or before such date. Notice of the proposition and of the date set for the vote shall be given each member not more than 30 nor less than ten days prior to such date. Approval of the proposition shall be by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members voting, in person or in writing, either at a meeting of the credit union or through a mail ballot vote. In order for a vote to be considered valid, there must be a quorum established. In the case of a meeting of the credit union, a quorum shall be established by the presence of at least 10% of the credit union's membership. In the case of a mail ballot vote, a quorum shall be established by the written response of at least 10% of the credit union's membership.\n\n(2) A statement of the result of the vote, certified by an officer of the credit union, shall be filed with the department within ten days after the vote is taken.\n\n(3) Promptly after the vote is taken and in no event later than 90 days thereafter, if the proposition for conversion was approved, the credit union shall take such action as may be necessary under the applicable laws of the United States to make it a Federal credit union, and, within ten days after receipt of the Federal credit union charter, it shall file a copy of the charter thus issued with the Department of State which shall furnish a copy thereof to the department. Upon such filing with the Department of State, the credit union shall no longer be subject to any of the provisions of this title. The successor Federal credit union shall be vested with all of the assets and shall continue to be responsible for all of the obligations of the credit union thus converted to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place.\n\n(b) Cross reference.--See 15 Pa.C.S. § 134 (relating to docketing statement).\n\n(Dec. 12, 1994, P.L.1067, No.146, eff. 60 days; Dec. 9, 2002, P.L.1572, No.207, eff. 60 days; June 18, 2014, P.L.754, No.62, eff. 60 days)\n\n2014Amendment.Act 62 amended subsec.
