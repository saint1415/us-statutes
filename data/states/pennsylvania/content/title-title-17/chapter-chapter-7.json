A credit union may also retain its original field of membership and, additionally, include in its field of membership other occupational groups, as well as like associational groups having a common bond with the original field of membership, with insufficient number of members to form or conduct the affairs of a separate credit union, if the existing credit union obtains prior permission from the department. The membership of a credit union shall be limited to and consist of the incorporators of the credit union and such other persons, having the common bond of association, set forth in the articles of incorporation, as have been duly admitted members, have paid the entrance fee as provided in the bylaws and own and retain one or more shares. Organizations composed principally of the same group as the credit union membership may be members. Employes of credit unions may be members of such credit unions.\n\n(b) Family members.--Persons who are members of the immediate family of a member of the credit union may be elected to membership.\n\n(c) Trust and joint tenancy deposits.--Shares may be issued in trust for or in joint tenancy with the right of survivorship with any person designated by the credit union member, but no joint tenant or beneficiary of a trust shall be permitted to vote, obtain a loan or hold office unless he is within the field of membership and is a qualified member in his own right.\n\n(d) Continuation of membership.--Any member who leaves or has left the field of membership and has not withdrawn all of his share account shall not cease to be a member of the credit union by reason thereof, and he shall have all of the rights and obligations of membership, including, but not limited to, the right to retain and to add to his share account and the right to vote. Upon leaving the field of membership, the provisions of this subsection shall apply to persons who have become members of the credit union solely by reason of the provisions of subsection (b), but the provisions of subsection (c) shall not be affected by this subsection.\n\n(e) Spouse of deceased member.--The unremarried widow or widower of a deceased member may become a member of the credit union.\n\n(f) Effect of certain association formations.--Any association formed primarily to obtain a State credit union charter shall not be considered by the department to have a sufficient common bond.\n\n(Dec. 9, 2002, P.L.1572, No.207, eff. 60 days)\n\n2002 Amendment.Act 207 amended subsec.
