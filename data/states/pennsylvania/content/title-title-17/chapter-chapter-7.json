Persistent recordkeeping deficiencies shall be considered serious if the department has a reasonable doubt:\n\n(1) That the financial condition of the credit union is accurately and fairly presented in the credit union's statement.\n\n(2) That management practices and procedures of the credit union are sufficient to safeguard members' assets.\n\n(Dec. 9, 2002, P.L.1572, No.207, eff. 60 days)\n\n2002 Amendment.Act 207 amended the section heading and subsecs.
