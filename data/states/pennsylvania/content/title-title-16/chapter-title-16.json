      "text": "§ 107. Reciprocal limitations. (a) Short title of section.-- This section shall be known and may be cited as the Reciprocal Limitations Act. (b) Legislative findings.-- It is hereby determined by the General Assembly to reaffirm the legislative findings contained in the act of November 28, 1986 (P.L.1465, No.146), known as the Reciprocal Limitations Act, and codified in this section: (1) The award of contracts to the lowest responsible bidder generally provides for the most economical procurement of supplies and construction. (2) In some cases, award to the lowest responsible bidder may not be the most economical and practicable when the best interests of the Commonwealth are concerned. (3) Some states apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or they apply a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders. (4) The application of this preference or prohibition by other states diminishes or eliminates opportunities for bidders and manufacturers who reside in this Commonwealth to obtain construction contracts from or to sell supplies to states that have this preference, thereby resulting in the loss of business for resident bidders and manufacturers. Therefore, in order to offset or counteract the discriminatory practices of other states, discourage other states from applying a preference and ultimately to aid employment, help business and industry located in this Commonwealth, attract new business and industry to this Commonwealth and provide additional tax revenue both from those receiving contracts and those employed by contractors, the General Assembly hereby declares that it is the policy of this Commonwealth to respond in like manner against those states that apply preferences or prohibitions by giving a similar offsetting preference to residents in this Commonwealth and bidders offering supplies manufactured in this Commonwealth and by prohibiting the purchase or use of certain supplies, in accordance with the provisions of this section. (c) Preference for supplies.-- In all procurements of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 (relating to small procurements), all Commonwealth agencies shall give preference to those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in this Commonwealth as against those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that gives or requires a preference to supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the other state for that particular supply. (d) Preference for resident bidders or offerors.-- When a contract for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 is to be awarded, a resident bidder or offeror shall be granted a preference as against a nonresident bidder or offeror from any state that gives or requires a preference to bidders or offerors from that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the state of the nonresident bidder or offeror. (e) Prohibition.-- For all contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, no Commonwealth agency shall specify for, use or procure any supplies which are produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that prohibits the specification for, use or procurement of these supplies in or on its public buildings or other works when these supplies are not produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. (f) Listing discriminating states.-- The department shall prepare a list of the states which apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or offerors or a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders or offerors and shall publish the list in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. When a state applies a new preference or prohibition, the department shall publish that information in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as an addition to the original list. (g) Inclusion in invitation for bids or request for proposals.-- In all invitations for bids and requests for proposals for the procurement of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, all Commonwealth agencies shall include a list of all the states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference favoring in-state supplies, bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 shall include a list of all states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference for in-state bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the purchasing agency for small procurements under section 514 shall also include a list of all states that apply a prohibition against certain supplies and shall inform potential bidders or offerors that they are prohibited from using supplies from those states. If a bid or proposal discloses that the bidder or offeror is offering supplies from a state which prohibits the use of out-of-state supplies, the bid or proposal shall be rejected. (h) Federal funds.-- The provisions of this section shall not be applicable when the application of this section may jeopardize the receipt of Federal funds. (i) Waiver.-- The provisions of this section may be waived when the head of the purchasing agency determines in writing that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth. (j) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Resident bidder or offeror.\" A person, partnership, corporation or other business entity authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth and having a bona fide establishment for transacting business in this Commonwealth at which it was transacting business on the date when bids or proposals for the public contract were first solicited.

The act of November 28, 1986 (P.L.1465, No.146), known as the Reciprocal Limitations Act, referred to in subsec. (b), was repealed by the act of May, 15, 1998, (P.L.358, No.57).

(a) Prohibition.-- (1) No commissioner may evade the provisions of section 15102 (relating to contract procedures, terms and bonds and advertising for bids) for advertising for bids or purchasing or contracting for services and personal properties piece-meal, for the purpose of obtaining prices under the base amount of $18,500, subject to adjustment under section 15101(c) (relating to commissioners sole contractors for county generally), upon transactions which should, in the exercise of reasonable discretion and prudence, be conducted as one transaction amounting to more than the base amount of $18,500, subject to adjustment under section 15101(c). This paragraph is intended to make unlawful the practice of evading advertising requirements by making a series of purchases or contracts each for less than the advertising requirement price, or by making several simultaneous purchases or contracts each below that price, if in either case the transaction involved should have been made as one transaction for one price. (2) Commissioners who vote in violation of this provision and who know that the transaction upon which the commissioners so vote is or should be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids shall be, jointly and severally, subject to surcharge for any loss sustained. (3) If it appears that a county commissioner may have voted in violation of this section, but the purchase or contract on which a county commissioner voted was not approved by the board of commissioners, this section shall be inapplicable. (b) Criminal offense.-- Each county commissioner who votes to unlawfully evade section 15102 and who knows that the transaction is or should be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids commits a misdemeanor of the third degree for each contract entered into as a direct result of that vote. This penalty shall be in addition to any surcharge that may be assessed under subsection (a).",

After the notice period, the county commissioners may sell the property in whole or in part for the best price or prices obtainable. (c) Large lots.-- If the county commissioners estimate the sale value of the personal property or of the surplus farm products to be sold at $2,000 or more, the entire lot shall be advertised for sale, once, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the county, and sale of the property advertised shall be made to the highest and best bidder.

(f) Electronic auctions.-- A public auction of personal property may be conducted by means of an online or electronic auction sale. During an electronic auction sale, bids shall be accepted electronically at the time and in the manner designated in the advertisement. During the electronic auction, each bidder shall have the capability to view the bidder's bid rank or the high bid price. Bidders may increase bid prices during the electronic auction.

These accounts may be in the custody of the depository's trust department or at a third-party financial institution. The arrangement with the depository may be governed by a written agreement, approved by the board of directors or loan committee of the depository, with approval reflected in the minutes of the board or committee, which are kept continuously as an official record of the depository. The agreement shall include all of the following if collateral is pledged instead of a Federal Home Loan Bank letter of credit: (i) Collateral shall be marked to market daily. (ii) Collateral shall be in investments as prescribed in the investment program provided by the board of investment or the county commissioners.

(a) Prohibition.-- (1) No commissioner may evade the provisions of section 15102 (relating to contract procedures, terms and bonds and advertising for bids) for advertising for bids or purchasing or contracting for services and personal properties piece-meal, for the purpose of obtaining prices under the base amount of $18,500, subject to adjustment under section 15101(c) (relating to commissioners sole contractors for county generally), upon transactions which should, in the exercise of reasonable discretion and prudence, be conducted as one transaction amounting to more than the base amount of $18,500, subject to adjustment under section 15101(c). This paragraph is intended to make unlawful the practice of evading advertising requirements by making a series of purchases or contracts each for less than the advertising requirement price, or by making several simultaneous purchases or contracts each below that price, if in either case the transaction involved should have been made as one transaction for one price. (2) Commissioners who vote in violation of this provision and who know that the transaction upon which the commissioners so vote is or should be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids shall be, jointly and severally, subject to surcharge for any loss sustained. (3) If it appears that a county commissioner may have voted in violation of this section, but the purchase or contract on which a county commissioner voted was not approved by the board of commissioners, this section shall be inapplicable. (b) Criminal offense.-- Each county commissioner who votes to unlawfully evade section 15102 and who knows that the transaction is or should be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids commits a misdemeanor of the third degree for each contract entered into as a direct result of that vote. This penalty shall be in addition to any surcharge that may be assessed under subsection (a).",

(a) Findings.-- The General Assembly finds as follows: (1) The health, safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth are directly dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within this Commonwealth. (2) Unemployment, the spread of indigency and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. (3) Development of convention centers is appropriate within the redevelopment assistance eligible area of a third class county and that the attraction of business to this Commonwealth as a result of the development is an important factor in the continual encouragement, promotion, attraction, stimulation, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within the county seat, the surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (4) The purpose of a convention center should be the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in the county seat, the surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (5) The development of a convention center will provide benefits to the hotel industry throughout the entire area of the county in which the convention center is developed. (6) The development of a convention center will also provide benefits to the restaurant and entertainment industries throughout the entire county in which the convention center is located, to all other businesses and individuals benefited by the attraction of major conventions and tourists, to other individual businesses whose livelihood is dependent on major conventions and tourists and to the general public. (7) The need for and promotion of the type of facility which will provide significant benefits to the general public will require the expenditure of public money, and it is appropriate to authorize a county to impose and collect a tax applicable within the entire territorial limits of the county to facilitate the development of a convention facility and the promotion of tourism within the county. (8) To promote the development of convention centers within this Commonwealth, it is necessary to provide additional and flexible means of developing, constructing, designing, managing, financing and operating convention centers. (9) An important aspect of the development of convention centers should be the removal and redevelopment of blighted areas. (b) Declaration.-- It is declared to be the policy of the Commonwealth to promote the health, safety, employment, business opportunities and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing for the creation of third class county convention center authorities, which shall exist and operate as public instrumentalities of the Commonwealth for the public purpose of promoting, attracting, stimulating, developing and expanding business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. This purpose is declared to be a public purpose supporting the enactment of all provisions of this subchapter for which public money may be spent and taxes may be imposed. (c) Scope of subchapter.-- (1) This subchapter shall not apply to a county which has an existing convention center owned, leased or operated by an existing authority or the Commonwealth, which covers an area of more than 40,000 square feet. (2) This subchapter shall not apply to a county which is served, together with one or more other counties, by a joint planning commission. (3) No provision of this subchapter other than section 17323 (relating to hotel room rental tax) shall apply to an existing authority.",

(a) Findings.-- It is determined and declared that: (1) The health, safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth are directly dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within this Commonwealth. (2) Unemployment, the spread of indigence and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. (3) Development of convention centers is appropriate within a third class county and the attraction of business to this Commonwealth as a result of such development is an important factor in the continual encouragement, promotion, attraction, stimulation, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within the county seat, the surrounding municipalities and this Commonwealth as a whole. (4) The purpose of a convention center should be the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in the county seat, the surrounding municipalities and this Commonwealth as a whole. (5) The development of a convention center will provide benefits to the hotel industry throughout the entire area of the county in which the center is developed.

(7) The need for and promotion of the type of facility which will provide significant benefits to the general public will require the expenditure of public money and it is therefore appropriate to authorize a county to impose and collect a tax applicable within the entire territorial limits of the county to facilitate the development of a convention facility and the promotion of tourism within the county. (8) To promote the development of convention centers within this Commonwealth, it is necessary to provide additional and flexible means of developing, constructing, designing, managing, financing and operating convention centers. (9) An important aspect of the development of convention centers should be the removal and redevelopment of blighted areas. (b) Declaration of policy.-- It is declared to be the policy of the Commonwealth to promote the health, safety, employment, business opportunities and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing for the creation of third class county convention center authorities which exist and operate as public instrumentalities of the Commonwealth for the public purpose of promoting, attracting, stimulating, developing and expanding business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. The purpose is declared to be a public purpose supporting the enactment of this subchapter for which public money may be spent and taxes may be imposed. (c) Scope.-- (1) This subchapter shall apply to counties of the third class. (2) This subchapter may not apply to: (i) A county which has created, either individually or jointly with its county seat, a third class county convention center authority under this subchapter or the former act of December 27, 1994 (P.L.1375, No.162), known as the Third Class County Convention Center Authority Act, prior to January 1, 2000.

The option shall be exercised by the adoption of a resolution by the governing body of the county. The exercise of the option under this paragraph may not be revoked. (2) If an authority is organized under paragraph (1), the following transitional provisions shall apply to the authority, the county, the county seat, State public bodies and political subdivisions: (i) all acts of the authority shall be considered granted under the authority of this subchapter, regardless of whether the acts were taken prior to or after December 18, 2000; (ii) all acts of the county and, if applicable, the county seat in organizing the authority shall be considered granted under the authority of this subchapter, regardless of whether the acts were taken prior to or after December 18, 2000; (iii) all acts of the county taken or purported to be taken under the authority of Subchapter A, including the enactment of a hotel room rental tax, shall be considered granted under the authority of this subchapter, regardless of whether the acts were taken prior to or after December 18, 2000; and (iv) all acts with respect to the authority of a State public body or a political subdivision taken or purported to be taken under the authority of Subchapter A, including the transfer of existing convention center facilities to the authority and the funding of a convention center project as a redevelopment assistance project by the Commonwealth, shall be considered granted under the authority of this subchapter, regardless of whether the acts were taken prior to or after December 18, 2000.
