The repeal by the County Code of any provisions of law may not revive any law repealed or superseded prior to January 1, 1956, nor affect the existence or class of any county created prior to January 1, 1956. This title may not affect any act done, liability incurred or right accrued or vested, nor affect any suit or prosecution, pending or to be instituted, to enforce any right or penalty or punish any offense under the authority of the repealed laws.\n\n(b) Local laws.--Each ordinance, resolution, regulation and rule, made under an act repealed by the County Code, shall continue with the same force and effect as if the act had not been repealed. Each local act applying to particular counties, not specifically repealed, shall continue in force, and any provisions of this title inconsistent with local laws may not apply to the counties affected by the local laws, unless the application is clearly indicated.\n\n(c) Remain in force.--All acts and parts of acts relating to counties, or to particular classes of counties, in force as of January 1, 1956, and not repealed by the County Code, shall remain in force in the same manner and with the same effect as prior to the adoption of the County Code.\n\n(d) Second Class County Code.--This title shall be considered a continuation of the act of July 28, 1953 (P.L.723, No.230), known as the Second Class County Code, as it pertains to second class A counties, except where otherwise expressly provided. The repeal of the Second Class County Code as it relates to second class A counties by former section 3901 of the County Code may not be construed as modifying or repealing any term of office, power, ordinance, rule or regulation of home rule counties or counties of the second class A existing on December 24, 2018.",
