(relating to waiver of standards).\n\n(5) Each library system receiving State aid under this subsection may distribute the local library share of that aid in a manner as determined by the board of directors of the library system, except that this paragraph shall not apply to a library system operating in a county of the second class.\n\n(j) Fiscal year 2010-2011.--State aid to libraries for fiscal year 2010-2011 shall be calculated as follows:\n\n(1) The sum of the amount of funding that the library received in fiscal year 2009-2010 under subsection (i) divided by the total State-aid subsidy for fiscal year 2009-2010.\n\n(2) The result obtained under paragraph (1) multiplied by the total State-aid subsidy for 2010-2011.\n\n(3) Following distribution of funds appropriated for State aid to libraries, any remaining funds may be distributed at the discretion of the State Librarian.\n\n(4) If funds appropriated for State aid to libraries in fiscal year 2010-2011 are less than funds appropriated in fiscal year 2002-2003, the State Librarian may waive standards as prescribed under section 9332.\n\n(5) Each library system receiving State aid under this subsection may distribute the local library share of that aid in a manner as determined by the board of directors of the library system, except that this paragraph shall not apply to a library system operating in a county of the second class.\n\n(k) Fiscal year 2013-2014.--Each library subject to this part shall be eligible for State aid for fiscal year 2013-2014 as follows:\n\n(1) Funds appropriated for libraries shall be distributed to each library under the following formula:\n\n(i) Divide the amount of funding that the library received in fiscal year 2012-2013 under section 2319 of the act of March 10, 1949 (P.L.30, No.14), known as the Public School Code of 1949, by the total State-aid subsidy for fiscal year 2012-2013.\n\n(ii) Multiply the quotient under subparagraph (i) by the total State-aid subsidy for 2013-2014.\n\n(2) Following distribution of funds appropriated for State aid to libraries under paragraph (1), any remaining funds may be distributed to libraries at the discretion of the State Librarian.\n\n(3) If funds appropriated for State aid to libraries in fiscal year 2013-2014 are less than funds appropriated in fiscal year 2002-2003, the State Librarian may waive standards as prescribed under section 9332.\n\n(4) (i) Each library system receiving State aid under this subsection may distribute the local library share of that aid in a manner as determined by the board of directors of the library system.\n\n(ii) In the case of a library system that contains a library operating in a city of the second class, changes to the distribution of State aid to the library shall be made by mutual agreement between the library and the library system.\n\n(5) In the event of a change in district library center population prior to the effective date of this section as a result of:\n\n(i) a city, borough, town, township, school district or county moving from one library center to another; or\n\n(ii) a transfer of district library center status to a county library system,\n\nfunding of district library center aid shall be paid based on the population of the newly established or reconfigured district library center.\n\nReferences in Text.The act of June 14,

The aid shall not be less than 25¢ for each person residing in the municipalities.\n\n(2) If the allocation for basic aid exceeds the amount necessary to pay the minimum rate, the entire allocation shall be distributed at a per capita rate which shall be determined by dividing the allocation by the number of persons in this Commonwealth on behalf of which local libraries and library systems apply and qualify for basic aid. In the first year in which a library applies for State aid, it shall qualify by making a minimum financial effort equal to one-quarter mill, or $1 per capita for each person residing in the municipalities, whichever is less.\n\n(c) Qualification.--\n\n(1) In each of the succeeding five years, the library shall qualify for maximum State aid only when it increases its financial effort by the following scale of percentages of the difference between the financial effort with which the library initially qualified for State aid and a financial effort equal to one-half mill, or $2 per capita for each person residing in the municipalities for which it applies for aid, whichever is less:\n\n1st succeeding year-20%;\n\n2nd succeeding year-40%;\n\n3rd succeeding year-60%;\n\n4th succeeding year-80%; and\n\n5th succeeding year-100%.\n\n(2) If the increase in any year is less than the percentage specified under paragraph (1), the amount of State aid shall be reduced by a percentage equal to one-fifth of the percentage which the difference between the required increase and the actual increase bears to the required increase multiplied by the number of years of participation in State aid beyond the first year.\n\n(d) Ineligibility.--After the fifth succeeding year, a local library shall not be eligible for further State aid unless it makes a financial effort equal to one-half mill for the municipalities on behalf of which it applies for aid, or $2 per capita for each person residing in those municipalities, whichever is less.",
