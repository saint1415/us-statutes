      "text": "(a) Computation of credited service.--In computing credited school service of a member for the determination of benefits, a full-time salaried school employee shall receive one year of credit for each school year or the corresponding fraction thereof, in accordance with the proportion of the full school year for which the required regular member contributions have been made to the fund, or for which such contributions otherwise required for such service were not made to the fund solely by reason of any provision of this part relating to the limitations under IRC § 401(a)(17) or 415. A per diem or hourly school employee shall receive one year of credited service for each nonoverlapping period of 12 consecutive months in which he is employed and for which contributions are made to the fund, or would have been made to the fund but for such limitations under the IRC, for at least 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours of employment. If such member was employed and contributions were made to the fund for less than 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours, he shall be credited with a fractional portion of a year determined by the ratio of the number of full-day sessions or hours of service actually rendered to 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours, as the case may be. A part-time salaried employee shall be credited with the fractional portion of the year which corresponds to the service actually rendered and for which contributions are or would have been made to the fund except for the limitations under the IRC in relation to the service required as a comparable full-time salaried employee. In no case shall a member receive more than one year of credited service for any 12 consecutive months or a member who has elected multiple service receive an aggregate in the two systems of more than one year of credited service for any 12 consecutive months.\n\n(b) Approved leaves of absence.--An active member shall receive credit for an approved leave of absence provided that:\n\n(1) the member returns for a period at least equal to the length of the leave or one year, whichever is less, to the school district which granted his leave, unless such condition is waived by the employer; and\n\n(2) the proper contributions are made by the member and the employer.\n\n(b.1) Optional credit for leave of absence for activated military service.--\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, a member who is granted leave of absence for activated military service shall be entitled to exercise any one of the following options in regard thereto:\n\n(i) He may continue to make payments into the fund as provided for in this part during the period of his leave of absence for activated military service.\n\n(ii) He may discontinue making payments into the fund during the period of his leave of absence for activated military service. In such event, the employer shall continue to make its contributions during this period. The employee's retirement rights shall be determined by completely disregarding the period of his leave of absence for activated military leave for all purposes.\n\n(2) Any member desiring to exercise option (i) in paragraph (1) shall file in writing with the board such an election within 60 days after the commencement of his leave of absence for activated military service or within 60 days after the effective date of this subsection, whichever shall later occur. Any member who does not exercise option (i) in this manner will be deemed to have exercised option (ii).\n\n(3) Any member who has exercised option (ii) in paragraph (1), but who, upon the expiration of his leave of absence for activated military service, returns to his employment and desires to receive the benefits of option (i), shall have the right to receive such benefits if he shall comply with the following requirements:\n\n(i) He shall, within one year after he returns to his employment, give written notice to the board of his desire to receive the benefits of option (i).\n\n(ii) He shall pay into the fund an amount equal to the total payments he would have made had he exercised option (i), plus statutory interest that would have been credited to his members' savings account, had such contributions been credited with statutory interest during the period the contributions would have been made and during all periods of subsequent school and State service up to the date of payment. Upon certification of the amount due, payment may be made in a lump sum within 90 days or, in the case of an active member, it may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions or by personal checks in amounts agreed upon by the member and board.\n\n(4) This subsection shall apply to leaves of absence for activated military service that commence on or before June 30, 2013.\n\n(b.2) Credited service as retirement incentive.--Notwithstanding any provisions of this title to the contrary, for the period of May 15, 1992, to August 31, 1993, a member who is not an annuitant on May 15, 1992, who terminates school service between May 15, 1992, and August 31, 1993, inclusive, who will be 55 years of age or older on August 31, 1993, with ten or more eligibility points, who files an application for retirement before September 1, 1993, and who declares his intent to retire prior to April 1, 1993, shall be credited with an additional 10% of their credited service.\n\n(c) Cancellation of credited service.--All credited service in the system shall be cancelled if a member withdraws his accumulated deductions, except that a partial or total distribution of accumulated total defined contributions to a participant who is also a member may not cancel service credited in the system.\n\n(d) Credit for military service.--A school employee who has performed USERRA leave may receive credit in the system as follows:\n\n(1) For purposes of determining whether a member is eligible to receive credited service in the system for a period of active military service, other than active duty service to meet periodic training requirements, rendered after August 5, 1991, and that began before the effective date of this paragraph, the provisions of 51 Pa.C.S. Ch. 73 (relating to military leave of absence) shall apply to all individuals who were active members of the system when the period of military service began, notwithstanding if the member is not defined as an employee under 51 Pa.C.S. § 7301 (relating to definitions). School employees may not receive service credit or exercise the options under 51 Pa.C.S. § 7306(a), (b) and (c) (relating to retirement rights) for military leaves that begin on or after the effective date of this subsection, except otherwise provided under this subsection.\n\n(2) A school employee who has performed USERRA leave may receive credit as provided by this paragraph.\n\n(i) A school employee who is reemployed from USERRA leave as an active member of the system shall be treated as not having incurred a break in school service by reason of the USERRA leave and shall be granted eligibility points as if the school employee had not been on the USERRA leave. If a school employee who is reemployed from USERRA leave as an active member of the system subsequently makes regular member contributions, shared-risk member contributions and any other member contributions in the amounts and in the time periods required by 38 U.S.C. Ch. 43 (relating to employment and reemployment rights of members of the uniformed services) and IRC § 414(u) as if the school employee had continued in his school office or employment and performed school service and been compensated during the period of USERRA leave, then the school employee shall be granted school service credit for the period of USERRA leave. The employee shall have his benefits, rights and obligations determined under this part as if he was an active member who performed creditable school service during the USERRA leave in the job position that he would have held had he not been on USERRA leave and received the compensation on which the member contributions to receive school service credit for the USERRA leave were determined.\n\n(ii) For purposes of determining whether a school employee has made the required employee contributions for school service credit for USERRA leave, if an employee who is reemployed from USERRA leave as an active member of the system terminates school service or dies in school service before the expiration of the allowed payment period, school service credit for the USERRA leave shall be granted as if the required member contributions were paid the day before termination or death. The amount of the required member contributions shall be treated as an incomplete payment subject to the provisions of section 8325 (relating to incomplete payments). Upon a subsequent return to school service or to State service as a multiple service member, the required member contributions treated as incomplete payments shall be treated as member contributions that were either withdrawn in a lump sum at termination or paid as a lump sum under section 8345(a)(4) (relating to member's options). For this purpose, the exclusion of Class T-E and Class T-F members from electing a form of payment under section 8345(a)(4)(iii) shall be ignored.\n\n(iii) A school employee who is reemployed from USERRA leave as an active member of the system and who does not make the required member contributions or makes only part of the required member contributions within the allowed payment period shall not be:\n\n(A) Granted credited service for the period of USERRA leave for which the required member contributions were not timely made.\n\n(B) Eligible to subsequently make contributions.\n\n(C) Granted either school service credit or nonschool service credit for the period of USERRA leave for which the required member contributions were not timely made.\n\n(3) A school employee who is a member of the system and performs USERRA leave from which the employee could have been reemployed from USERRA leave had the school employee returned to school service in the time frames required by 38 U.S.C. Ch. 43 for reemployment rights, but did not do so, shall be able to receive creditable nonschool service as nonintervening military service for the period of USERRA leave if the employee later returns to school service and is otherwise eligible to purchase the service as nonintervening military service.\n\n(4) An active or inactive member who, on or after the effective date of this subsection, is granted a leave of absence under section 1178 of the Public School Code, a leave of absence under 51 Pa.C.S. § 4102 (relating to leaves of absence for certain government employees) or a military leave under 51 Pa.C.S. Ch. 73, that is not USERRA leave shall be able to receive creditable nonschool service as nonintervening military service should the employee return to school service as an active member of the system and is otherwise eligible to purchase the service as nonintervening military service.\n\n(5) If a member dies while performing USERRA leave, the beneficiaries or survivor annuitants of the deceased member shall be entitled to any additional benefits, including eligibility points, other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service, provided under this part as if the member resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.\n\n(6) A school employee who is on a leave of absence from his duties as a school employee and for which 51 Pa.C.S. § 4102 provides that he is not to suffer a loss of pay, time or efficiency shall not be an active member, receive service credit or make member contributions for the leave of absence except as provided for in this part. Notwithstanding this paragraph, any pay the member receives under section 1178 of the Public School Code or 51 Pa.C.S. § 4102 shall be included in the determination of final average salary and other calculations in the system utilizing compensation as if the payments were compensation under this part.\n\n(e) Military service by a participant.--A participant who has performed USERRA leave shall be treated and may make contributions as follows:\n\n(1) A participant who is reemployed from USERRA leave may not be treated as having incurred a break in school service by reason of the USERRA leave and shall be granted eligibility points as if the participant had not been on USERRA leave. If a participant who is reemployed from USERRA leave subsequently makes mandatory pickup participant contributions in the amounts and in the time periods required by 38 U.S.C. Ch. 43 and IRC § 414(u) as if the participant had continued in the participant's school employment and performed school service and been compensated during the period of USERRA leave, then the participant's employer shall make the corresponding employer defined contributions. The employee shall have contributions, benefits, rights and obligations determined under this part as if the employee was an active participant who performed school service during the USERRA leave in the job position that the employee would have held had the employee not been on USERRA leave and received the compensation on which the mandatory pickup participant contributions to receive school service credit for the USERRA leave were determined, including the right to make voluntary contributions on such compensation as permitted by law.\n\n(2) A participant who is reemployed from USERRA leave and does not make the mandatory pickup participant contributions or makes only part of the mandatory pickup participant contributions within the allowed payment period may not be eligible to make mandatory pickup participant contributions and voluntary contributions at a later date for the period of USERRA leave for which the mandatory pickup participant contributions were not timely made.\n\n(3) A participant who performs USERRA leave from which the employee could have been reemployed from USERRA leave had the school employee returned to school service in the time frames required by 38 U.S.C. Ch. 43 for reemployment rights, but did not do so, may not be eligible to make mandatory pickup participant contributions or voluntary contributions for the period of USERRA leave should the employee later return to school service and be a participant in the plan.\n\n(4) An active participant or inactive participant who, on or after the effective date of this subsection, is granted a leave of absence under 51 Pa.C.S. § 4102 or a military leave under 51 Pa.C.S. Ch. 73 that is not USERRA leave may not be eligible to make mandatory pickup participant contributions or voluntary contributions during or for the leave of absence or military leave, and may not have employer defined contributions made during such leave, without regard to whether or not the participant received salary, wages, stipends, differential wage payments or other payments from the participant's employer during the leave, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in 51 Pa.C.S. § 4102 or 51 Pa.C.S. Ch. 73.\n\n(5) If a participant dies while performing USERRA leave, then the beneficiaries or successor payees of the deceased participant are entitled to any additional benefits, other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service, provided under this part had the participant resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.\n\n(July 22, 1983, P.L.104, No.31, eff. imd.; Dec. 19, 1984, P.L.1191, No.226, eff. imd.; Aug. 5, 1991, P.L.183, No.23, eff. imd.; Dec. 22, 1992, P.L.1686, No.186, eff. imd.; Apr. 29, 1994, P.L.159, No.29, eff. 60 days; Dec. 20, 1995, P.L.689, No.77, eff.

In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2010, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded as a level percentage of compensation over a period of ten years from the July 1 second succeeding the date such legislation is enacted.\n\n(e) Experience adjustment factor.--\n\n(1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability, excluding the gains or losses on the assets of the health insurance account, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience, changes in actuarial assumptions, changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, active members making shared-risk contributions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized as a level percentage of compensation over a period of 24 years beginning with the July 1 second succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases.\n\n(2) (Reserved).\n\n(f) Premium assistance contribution rate.--For each fiscal year beginning with July 1, 1991, the total contribution rate as calculated according to this section shall be increased annually in the full amount certified by the board as necessary to fund the premium assistance program in accordance with section 8509 (relating to health insurance premium assistance program), notwithstanding any other provisions of this section.\n\n(g) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.--\n\n(1) The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate, calculated without regard for the costs added by legislation, to the prior year's final contribution rate.\n\n(2) If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate, calculated without regard for the costs added by legislation, is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all other fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not be applicable. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of the total compensation of all active members.\n\n(h) Final contribution rate.--\n\n(1) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate is 5% of the total compensation of all active members.

An annuitant who is credited with an additional 10% of membership service as provided in section 8302(b.2) (relating to credited school service) and who returns to school service, except as provided in subsection (b), shall forfeit such credited service and shall have his frozen present value adjusted as if his 10% retirement incentive had not been applied to his account. In the event that the cost-of-living increase enacted December 18, 1979, occurred during the period of such State or school employment, the frozen present value shall be increased, on or after the member attains superannuation age, by the percent applicable had he not returned to service.\n\n(a.1) Return of benefits.--In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 8345 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to school service or entering State service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 90 days or in the case of an active member or a State employee who is an active member of the State Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a State employee who is an active member of the State Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the State Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid.\n\n(a.2) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.--If a former school employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and:\n\n(1) shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days; or\n\n(2) in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board for not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave. A repayment period under this paragraph may not exceed five years or a longer time as agreed to between the board and the member.\n\n(b) Return to school service during emergency.--When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public or in the event of a shortage of appropriate subject certified teachers or other personnel, an annuitant or participant receiving distributions may be returned to school service for a period not to extend beyond the school year during which the emergency or shortage occurs, without loss of his annuity or distributions, provided that the annuitant meets the conditions set forth in subsection (b.2). The annuitant or participant receiving distributions shall not be entitled to earn any credited service, and no contributions may be made to the fund or the trust by the annuitant or participant receiving distributions, the employer or the Commonwealth on account of such employment. Such service shall not be subject to member or participant contributions or be eligible for qualification as creditable school service or for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions, voluntary contributions or employer defined contributions.\n\n(b.1) Return to school service in an extracurricular position.--\n\n(1) An annuitant or participant receiving distributions may be employed under separate contract by a public school or charter school in an extracurricular position performed primarily outside regular instructional hours and not part of mandated curriculum without loss of annuity, provided that the annuitant meets the conditions set forth in subsection (b.2). The annuitant, the participant receiving distributions and the employer shall not make contributions to the member's savings account, the individual investment account or State accumulation account respectively for such service. Further, such contract shall contain a waiver whereby the annuitant waives any potential retirement benefits that could arise from the contract and releases the employer and the board from any liability for such benefits. Such service shall not be subject to member or participant contributions or be eligible for qualification as creditable school service or for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions or employer defined contributions.\n\n(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to abridge or limit any rights provided under a collective bargaining agreement or any rights provided under the act of July 23, 1970 (P.L.563, No.195), known as the Public Employe Relations Act.\n\n(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term \"extracurricular position\" means a contract position filled by an annuitant that is separate from the established academic course structure, including the position of athletic director.\n\n(b.2) Limitation on return to school service by an annuitant during emergency or in an extracurricular position.--\n\n(1) An annuitant may return to school service under subsection (b) or (b.1), provided the annuitant otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (b) or (b.1) and has attained the age set forth in IRC § 401(a)(36) or the applicable \"normal retirement age\" in 26 C.F.R. § 1.401(a)-1(b)(2) (relating to post-ERISA qualified plans and qualified trusts; in general).\n\n(2) An annuitant who has not reached the age as set forth in IRC § 401(a)(36), or the applicable \"normal retirement age\" under 26 C.F.R. § 1.401(a)-1(b)(2), may return to service under subsection (b) or (b.1) provided the annuitant otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (b) or (b.1) and has had a break in service, as set forth in paragraph (3).\n\n(3) For purposes of this subsection, a break in service occurs when a member has a bona fide termination of service. The following factors will be considered in determining whether there had been a bona fide termination of service:\n\n(i) whether the change in the employment relationship is more than a formal or technical change, requiring the severing of the employment connection with the employer;\n\n(ii) whether there has been a reasonable anticipation or prearranged agreement between the member and the employer that a return to school service under this section shall take place;\n\n(iii) the amount of time that has elapsed from the date the member becomes an annuitant and the return to school service;\n\n(iv) whether the services are a continuation of the annuitant's previous service with the same employer; and\n\n(v) such other factors as the board may deem appropriate.\n\n(c) Subsequent discontinuance of service.--Upon subsequent discontinuance of service, such member other than a former annuitant who had the effect of his frozen present value eliminated in accordance with subsection (d) or a former disability annuitant shall be entitled to an annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the sum of the present value as determined under subsection (a) and the present value of a maximum single life annuity based on years of service credited subsequent to reentry in the system and his final average salary computed by reference to his compensation during his entire period of school and State service.\n\n(d) Elimination of the effect of frozen present value.--\n\n(1) An annuitant who returns to school service as an active member of the system and earns three eligibility points by performing credited school service or reemployment from USERRA leave following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, or an annuitant who enters State service and:\n\n(i) is a multiple service member; or\n\n(ii) who elects multiple service membership, and\n\nearns three eligibility points by performing credited State service, reemployment from USERRA leave or credited school service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, and who had the present value of his annuity frozen in accordance with subsection (a), shall qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value resulting from all previous periods of retirement eliminated, provided that all payments under Option 4 and annuity payments payable during previous periods of retirement plus interest as set forth in paragraph (3) shall be returned to the fund in the form of an actuarial adjustment to his subsequent benefits or in such form as the board may otherwise direct.\n\n(2) Upon subsequent discontinuance of service and the filing of an application for an annuity from the system, a former annuitant who qualifies to have the effect of a frozen present value eliminated under this subsection shall be entitled to receive the higher of either:\n\n(i) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the freezing of the former annuitant's account pursuant to subsection (a) had not occurred, adjusted by crediting Class T-C school service as Class T-D service as provided for in section 8305(c) (relating to classes of service) and further adjusted according to paragraph (3), provided that a former annuitant of the system or a former annuitant of the State Employees' Retirement System who retired under a provision of law granting additional service credit if termination of school or State service or retirement occurred during a specific period of time shall not be permitted to retain the additional service credit under the prior law when the annuity is computed for his most recent retirement; or\n\n(ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect on the frozen present value eliminated,\n\nunless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity.\n\n(3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement. The interest for each year shall be calculated based upon the annual interest rate adopted for that school year by the board for the calculation of the normal contribution rate pursuant to section 8328(b) (relating to actuarial cost method).\n\n(July 12, 1981, P.L.261, No.87, eff. imd.; Feb. 18, 1982, P.L.78, No.27, eff. 60 days; Aug. 5, 1991, P.L.183, No.23, eff. imd.; Dec. 22, 1992, P.L.1686, No.186, eff. imd.; Apr. 29, 1994, P.L.159, No.29, eff.
