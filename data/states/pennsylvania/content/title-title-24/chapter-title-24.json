      "text": "§ 8328. Actuarial cost method. (a) Employer contribution rate.-- The amount of the total employer contributions shall be computed by the actuary as a percentage of the total compensation of all active members and active participants, as applicable, during the period for which the amount is determined and shall be so certified by the board. The total employer contribution rate shall be the sum of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) divided by the total compensation of all active members and active participants: (1) the final contribution amount computed by multiplying the final contribution rate calculated in subsection (h) by the total compensation of all active members; (2) the premium assistance contribution amount computed by multiplying the premium assistance contribution rate calculated in subsection (f) by the total compensation of all active members and active participants; and (3) the employer defined contributions as defined under section 8102 (relating to definitions). The actuarially required contribution shall be no less than the normal cost plus the cost to fully amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability calculated using actuarial methods and assumptions that are consistent with generally accepted actuarial standards and generally accepted accounting principles, including professional actuarial standards of practice. (b) Normal contribution rate.-- The normal contribution rate shall be determined after each actuarial valuation. Until all accrued liability contributions have been completed, the normal contribution rate shall be determined, on the basis of an annual interest rate and such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the board in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles, as a level percentage of the compensation of all active members, which percentage, if contributed from the start of their employment on the basis of their prospective compensation through their entire period of active school service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to them, in excess of that portion funded by their prospective member contributions, excluding the shared-risk contributions. In no case shall the employer's normal cost be less than zero. (c) Accrued liability contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2002, and ending June 30, 2011, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits of active members, except for the supplemental benefits provided in sections 8348 (relating to supplemental annuities), 8348.1 (relating to additional supplemental annuities), 8348.2 (relating to further additional supplemental annuities), 8348.3 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1994), 8348.4 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment), 8348.5 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1998), 8348.6 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2002) and 8348.7 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2003), in excess of the total assets in the fund (calculated by recognizing the actuarially expected investment return immediately and recognizing the difference between the actual investment return and the actuarially expected investment return over a five-year period), excluding the balance in the annuity reserve account, and of the present value of normal contributions and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members on July 1, 2002, during the remainder of their active service. (2) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2003, and ending June 30, 2011, the amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year, beginning July 1, 2002, except that, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2002, but before July 1, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded over a period of ten years from the first day of July, coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution for such additional legislative liabilities shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the first annual payment. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2011, the outstanding balance of the increase in accrued liability due to the change in benefits enacted in 2001 and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in fiscal year 2000-2001 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2002, and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in fiscal year 2001-2002 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2003. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded in equal dollar annual contributions over a period of ten years from the first day of July coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. (4) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund as a level percentage of compensation over a period of 24 years from July 1, 2011, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits calculated as of June 30, 2010, including the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 8348, 8348.1, 8348.2, 8348.3, 8348.4, 8348.5, 8348.6 and 8348.7, in excess of the actuarially calculated assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses each year in level annual installments over a ten-year period). In the event that the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2010, as a result of an increase in benefits determined on a total plan basis, such additional liability shall be funded as a level percentage of compensation over a period of ten years from the July 1 second succeeding the date such legislation is enacted. (5) For the fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2017, the actuarially calculated assets in the fund determined in accordance with paragraph (4) shall be no less than 70% and no more than 130% of market value. (d) Supplemental annuity contribution rate.-- (1) For the period of July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2011, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers required to provide for the payment of the supplemental annuities provided for in sections 8348, 8348.1, 8348.2, 8348.4 and 8348.5 shall be paid over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002. The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2002 provided for in section 8348.6 shall be as provided in section 8348.6(f). The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2003 provided for in section 8348.7 shall be as provided in section 8348.7(f). The amount of each annual supplemental annuities contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002. (2) For fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 8348, 8348.1, 8348.2, 8348.3, 8348.4, 8348.5, 8348.6 and 8348.7 shall be paid as part of the accrued liability contribution rate as provided for in subsection (c)(4), and there shall not be a separate supplemental annuity contribution rate attributable to those supplemental annuities. In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2010, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded as a level percentage of compensation over a period of ten years from the July 1 second succeeding the date such legislation is enacted. (e) Experience adjustment factor.-- (1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability, excluding the gains or losses on the assets of the health insurance account, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience, changes in actuarial assumptions, changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, active members making shared-risk contributions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized as a level percentage of compensation over a period of 24 years beginning with the July 1 second succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases. (2) (Reserved). (f) Premium assistance contribution rate.-- For each fiscal year beginning with July 1, 1991, the total contribution rate as calculated according to this section shall be increased annually in the full amount certified by the board as necessary to fund the premium assistance program in accordance with section 8509 (relating to health insurance premium assistance program), notwithstanding any other provisions of this section. (g) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.-- (1) The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate, calculated without regard for the costs added by legislation, to the prior year's final contribution rate. (2) If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate, calculated without regard for the costs added by legislation, is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all other fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not be applicable. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of the total compensation of all active members. (h) Final contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate is 5% of the total compensation of all active members. For each subsequent fiscal year for which the collared contribution rate is applicable, the final contribution rate shall be the collared contribution rate as calculated in subsection (g), plus the costs added by legislation. (2) For all other fiscal years, the final contribution rate shall be the actuarially required contribution rate, provided that the final contribution rate shall not be less than the normal contribution rate as provided in subsection (b). (i) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Actuarially required contribution rate.\" The sum of the following: (1) the normal contribution rate as calculated in subsection (b); (2) the accrued liability contribution rate as calculated in subsection (c); (3) the supplemental annuity contribution rate as calculated in subsection (d); (4) the experience adjustment factor as calculated in subsection (e); and (5) any costs added by legislation enacted prior to the last actuarial valuation. \"Costs added by legislation.\" The sum, if positive, of all changes in the actuarially required contribution rate resulting from legislation enacted in the year since the last actuarial valuation and not included in the determination of the prior year's final contribution rate, computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members certified by the actuary as sufficient to make the employer normal contributions and sufficient to amortize legislatively created changes in the unfunded actuarial liability as a level percentage of compensation over a period of ten years from the July 1 second succeeding the date of enactment.

      "text": "§ 8344. Disability annuities. (a) Amount of annuity.-- A member who has made application for a disability annuity as provided in section 8507(k) (relating to rights and duties of school employees, members and participants) and has been found to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of sections 8307(c) (relating to eligibility for annuities) and 8505(c)(1) (relating to duties of board regarding applications and elections of members and participants) shall receive a disability annuity payable from the effective date of disability and continued until a subsequent determination by the board that the annuitant is no longer entitled to a disability annuity. The disability annuity shall be a single life annuity that is equal to a sum of the standard single life annuities determined separately for each class of service if the total number of years of credited service is greater than 16.667, otherwise each standard single life annuity shall be multiplied by the lesser of the following ratios: Y*/Y or 16.667/Y where Y = total number of years of credited service and Y* = total years of credited service if the member were to continue as a school employee until attaining superannuation age, or if the member has attained superannuation age then the number of years of credited service. For purposes of calculating a disability annuity for a member of Class T-G or Class T-H, the standard single life annuity shall equal 2% of the final average salary, multiplied by the total number of years and fractional part of a year of service credited for such class of service. In no event shall the disability annuity plus any cost-of-living increases be less than $100 for each full year of credited service. The member shall be entitled to the election of a joint and survivor annuity on that portion of the disability annuity to which he is entitled under section 8342 (relating to maximum single life annuity). (b) Reduction on account of earned income.-- Payments on account of disability shall be reduced by that amount by which the earned income of the annuitant, as reported in accordance with section 8508(b) (relating to rights and duties of annuitants) for the preceding year together with the disability annuity payments for the year, exceeds the greater of $5,000 or the last year's salary of the annuitant as a member of the system, provided that the annuitant shall not receive less than his member's annuity or the amount to which he may be entitled under section 8342, whichever is greater. (c) Termination and modification of payments.-- Payment of that portion of the disability annuity in excess of the annuity to which the annuitant was entitled on the effective date of disability calculated in accordance with section 8342 shall cease if the annuitant is no longer eligible under the provisions of section 8505(c)(2) or section 8508(b) or (c) and if such annuitant on the date of termination of service was eligible for an annuity, he may file an application with the board for an election of an optional modification of the annuity to which he was entitled in accordance with section 8342. (d) Withdrawal of accumulated deductions.-- Upon termination of disability annuity payments in excess of an annuity calculated in accordance with section 8342, a disability annuitant who does not return to school service may file an application with the board for an amount equal to the accumulated deductions, shared-risk member contributions and statutory interest standing to his credit at the effective date of disability less the total payments received on account of his member's annuity. (e) Limitation regarding annual benefit under IRC § 415(b).-- Notwithstanding any provision of this part to the contrary, no benefit shall be payable to the extent that such benefit exceeds any limitation under IRC § 415(b) in effect with respect to governmental plans, as such term is defined in IRC § 414(d), on the date the benefit payment becomes effective, provided that any increase in any limitation under IRC § 415 shall be applicable to all current and future annuitants and survivor annuitants. (f) Coordination of benefits.-- The determination and payment of a disability annuity under this section shall be in addition to any payments a school employee may be entitled to receive, has received or is receiving as a result of being a participant in the plan.

      "text": "§ 8346. Termination of annuities. (a) General rule.-- If an annuitant returns to school service or enters or has entered State service and elects multiple service membership, any annuity payable to him under this part shall cease effective upon the date of his return to school service or entering State service without regard to whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member of the system or participant in the plan or, if a multiple service member, whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member or participant of the State Employees' Retirement System or State Employees' Defined Contribution Plan; and, in the case of an annuity other than a disability annuity the present value of such annuity, adjusted for full coverage in the case of a joint coverage member who makes the appropriate back contributions for full coverage, shall be frozen as of the date such annuity ceases. An annuitant who is credited with an additional 10% of membership service as provided in section 8302(b.2) (relating to credited school service) and who returns to school service, except as provided in subsection (b), shall forfeit such credited service and shall have his frozen present value adjusted as if his 10% retirement incentive had not been applied to his account. In the event that the cost-of-living increase enacted December 18, 1979, occurred during the period of such State or school employment, the frozen present value shall be increased, on or after the member attains superannuation age, by the percent applicable had he not returned to service. (a.1) Return of benefits.-- In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 8345 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to school service or entering State service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 90 days or in the case of an active member or a State employee who is an active member of the State Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a State employee who is an active member of the State Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the State Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid. (a.2) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.-- If a former school employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and: (1) shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days; or (2) in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board for not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave. A repayment period under this paragraph may not exceed five years or a longer time as agreed to between the board and the member. (b) Return to school service during emergency.-- When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public or in the event of a shortage of appropriate subject certified teachers or other personnel, an annuitant or participant receiving distributions may be returned to school service for a period not to extend beyond the school year during which the emergency or shortage occurs, without loss of his annuity or distributions, provided that the annuitant meets the conditions set forth in subsection (b.2). The annuitant or participant receiving distributions shall not be entitled to earn any credited service, and no contributions may be made to the fund or the trust by the annuitant or participant receiving distributions, the employer or the Commonwealth on account of such employment. Such service shall not be subject to member or participant contributions or be eligible for qualification as creditable school service or for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions, voluntary contributions or employer defined contributions. (b.1) Return to school service in an extracurricular position.-- (1) An annuitant or participant receiving distributions may be employed under separate contract by a public school or charter school in an extracurricular position performed primarily outside regular instructional hours and not part of mandated curriculum without loss of annuity, provided that the annuitant meets the conditions set forth in subsection (b.2). The annuitant, the participant receiving distributions and the employer shall not make contributions to the member's savings account, the individual investment account or State accumulation account respectively for such service. Further, such contract shall contain a waiver whereby the annuitant waives any potential retirement benefits that could arise from the contract and releases the employer and the board from any liability for such benefits. Such service shall not be subject to member or participant contributions or be eligible for qualification as creditable school service or for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions or employer defined contributions. (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to abridge or limit any rights provided under a collective bargaining agreement or any rights provided under the act of July 23, 1970 (P.L.563, No.195), known as the Public Employe Relations Act. (3) For purposes of this subsection, the term \"extracurricular position\" means a contract position filled by an annuitant that is separate from the established academic course structure, including the position of athletic director. (b.2) Limitation on return to school service by an annuitant during emergency or in an extracurricular position.-- (1) An annuitant may return to school service under subsection (b) or (b.1), provided the annuitant otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (b) or (b.1) and has attained the age set forth in IRC § 401(a)(36) or the applicable \"normal retirement age\" in 26 C.F.R. § 1.401(a)-1(b)(2) (relating to post-ERISA qualified plans and qualified trusts; in general). (2) An annuitant who has not reached the age as set forth in IRC § 401(a)(36), or the applicable \"normal retirement age\" under 26 C.F.R. § 1.401(a)-1(b)(2), may return to service under subsection (b) or (b.1) provided the annuitant otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (b) or (b.1) and has had a break in service, as set forth in paragraph (3). (3) For purposes of this subsection, a break in service occurs when a member has a bona fide termination of service. The following factors will be considered in determining whether there had been a bona fide termination of service: (i) whether the change in the employment relationship is more than a formal or technical change, requiring the severing of the employment connection with the employer; (ii) whether there has been a reasonable anticipation or prearranged agreement between the member and the employer that a return to school service under this section shall take place; (iii) the amount of time that has elapsed from the date the member becomes an annuitant and the return to school service; (iv) whether the services are a continuation of the annuitant's previous service with the same employer; and (v) such other factors as the board may deem appropriate. (c) Subsequent discontinuance of service.-- Upon subsequent discontinuance of service, such member other than a former annuitant who had the effect of his frozen present value eliminated in accordance with subsection (d) or a former disability annuitant shall be entitled to an annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the sum of the present value as determined under subsection (a) and the present value of a maximum single life annuity based on years of service credited subsequent to reentry in the system and his final average salary computed by reference to his compensation during his entire period of school and State service. (d) Elimination of the effect of frozen present value.-- (1) An annuitant who returns to school service as an active member of the system and earns three eligibility points by performing credited school service or reemployment from USERRA leave following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, or an annuitant who enters State service and: (i) is a multiple service member; or (ii) who elects multiple service membership, and earns three eligibility points by performing credited State service, reemployment from USERRA leave or credited school service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, and who had the present value of his annuity frozen in accordance with subsection (a), shall qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value resulting from all previous periods of retirement eliminated, provided that all payments under Option 4 and annuity payments payable during previous periods of retirement plus interest as set forth in paragraph (3) shall be returned to the fund in the form of an actuarial adjustment to his subsequent benefits or in such form as the board may otherwise direct. (2) Upon subsequent discontinuance of service and the filing of an application for an annuity from the system, a former annuitant who qualifies to have the effect of a frozen present value eliminated under this subsection shall be entitled to receive the higher of either: (i) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the freezing of the former annuitant's account pursuant to subsection (a) had not occurred, adjusted by crediting Class T-C school service as Class T-D service as provided for in section 8305(c) (relating to classes of service) and further adjusted according to paragraph (3), provided that a former annuitant of the system or a former annuitant of the State Employees' Retirement System who retired under a provision of law granting additional service credit if termination of school or State service or retirement occurred during a specific period of time shall not be permitted to retain the additional service credit under the prior law when the annuity is computed for his most recent retirement; or (ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect on the frozen present value eliminated, unless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity. (3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement. The interest for each year shall be calculated based upon the annual interest rate adopted for that school year by the board for the calculation of the normal contribution rate pursuant to section 8328(b) (relating to actuarial cost method).

(2) Requires the system to provide no more than the total amount of benefits than the member would otherwise receive (determined on the basis of actuarial value) unless increased benefits are paid to the member or alternate payee based upon cost-of-living increases or increases based on other than actuarial value. (3) Specifies the amount or percentage of the member's benefits to be paid by the system to each such alternate payee or the manner in which the amount or percentage is to be determined.

(a.1) Certification regarding participants.-- A domestic relations order pertaining to a participant shall be certified as an approved domestic relations order by the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, only if that order meets all of the following: (1) Does not require the plan to provide any type or form of benefit or any option applicable to members of the system or participants in the plan. (2) Does not require the segregation of the alternate payee's share of the participant's individual investment account into a subaccount or newly established individual account titled in the name of the alternate payee. (3) Does not require the plan to recover or distribute any funds that were distributed to the participant or at the participant's direction prior to the approval of the domestic relations order by the secretary of the board or his designated representative.

(6) Specifies the amount or percentage of the participant's individual investment account to be paid to the alternate payee and the date upon which such valuation is based. (7) Specifies the name and last known mailing address, if any, of the participant and the name and last known mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order and states that it is the responsibility of each alternate payee to keep a current mailing address on file with the plan.

(10) Requires the immediate distribution of the alternate payee's share of the participant's individual investment account, which may be made by direct payment, eligible rollover or trustee-to-trustee transfer to another eligible plan or qualified account owned by the alternate payee.

(b) Determination by secretary.-- Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of a domestic relations order, the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, shall determine whether the order is an approved domestic relations order and notify the member or participant and each alternate payee of this determination. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the exclusive remedy of any member, participant or alternate payee aggrieved by a decision of the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, shall be the right to an adjudication by the board under 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 (relating to practice and procedure) with appeal therefrom to the Commonwealth Court under 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 7 (relating to judicial review) and 42 Pa.C.S. § 763(a)(1) (relating to direct appeals from government agencies). (c) Other orders.-- The requirements for approval identified in subsections (a) and (a.1) shall not apply to any domestic relations order which is an order for support as that term is defined in 23 Pa.C.S. § 4302 (relating to definitions) or an order for the enforcement of arrearages as provided in 23 Pa.C.S. § 3703 (relating to enforcement of arrearages). These orders shall be approved to the extent that they do not attach moneys in excess of the limits on attachments as established by the laws of this Commonwealth and the United States, require distributions of benefits in a manner that would violate the laws of the United States, any other state or this Commonwealth or require the distribution of funds for support or enforcement of arrearages against any participant who is not receiving distributions from the plan at the time the order is entered. These orders may be approved notwithstanding any other provision of this part or the plan that would otherwise require a distribution of accumulated employer defined contributions in the form of an annuity or to require the purchase of an annuity. (d) Obligation discharged.-- Only the requirements of this part and any regulations promulgated hereunder shall be used to govern the approval or disapproval of a domestic relations order. Therefore, if the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, acts in accordance with the provisions of this part and any promulgated regulations in approving or disapproving a domestic relations order, then the obligations of the system or plan with respect to such approval or disapproval shall be discharged.

As used in this paragraph, \"negligent acts\" shall not include acts or conduct which constitutes a crime, actual fraud, actual malice or willful misconduct. (b) Acts which may impose liability.-- The following acts by a local agency or any of its employees may result in the imposition of liability on a local agency: (1) Vehicle liability.-- The operation of any motor vehicle in the possession or control of the local agency, provided that the local agency shall not be liable to any plaintiff that claims liability under this subsection if the plaintiff was, during the course of the alleged negligence, in flight or fleeing apprehension or resisting arrest by a police officer or knowingly aided a group, one or more of whose members were in flight or fleeing apprehension or resisting arrest by a police officer. As used in this paragraph, \"motor vehicle\" means any vehicle which is self-propelled and any attachment thereto, including vehicles operated by rail, through water or in the air.

(5) Utility service facilities.-- A dangerous condition of the facilities of steam, sewer, water, gas or electric systems owned by the local agency and located within rights-of-way, except that the claimant to recover must establish that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred and that the local agency had actual notice or could reasonably be charged with notice under the circumstances of the dangerous condition at a sufficient time prior to the event to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.

(ii) A dangerous condition of streets owned or under the jurisdiction of Commonwealth agencies, if all of the following conditions are met: (A) The local agency has entered into a written contract with a Commonwealth agency for the maintenance and repair by the local agency of such streets and the contract either: (I) had not expired or been otherwise terminated prior to the occurrence of the injury; or (II) if expired, contained a provision that expressly established local agency responsibility beyond the term of the contract for injuries arising out of the local agency's work. (B) The injury and dangerous condition were directly caused by the negligent performance of its duties under such contract. (C) The claimant must establish that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred and that the local agency had actual notice or could reasonably be charged with notice under the circumstances of the dangerous condition at a sufficient time prior to the event to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.

When a local agency is liable for damages under this paragraph by reason of its power and authority to require installation and repair of sidewalks under the care, custody and control of other persons, the local agency shall be secondarily liable only and such other persons shall be primarily liable. (8) Care, custody or control of animals.-- The care, custody or control of animals in the possession or control of a local agency, including but not limited to police dogs and horses. Damages shall not be recoverable under this paragraph on account of any injury caused by wild animals, including but not limited to bears and deer, except as otherwise provided by statute.

(a) General rule.-- The department shall distribute highway appropriations and executive authorizations for State highway maintenance in the various county maintenance districts in the following manner: (1) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are equal to the combined total base allocations for all the county maintenance districts, each maintenance district shall receive its base allocation. (2) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are less than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, each maintenance district's share shall be reduced, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocation within the funding limits, in the same proportion that each county's base allocations bears to the combined total of all counties' base allocations. (3) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are greater than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, the funds shall be distributed based upon the formula in subsection (b), but notwithstanding the formula calculation for any particular county, no county shall receive less than its base allocation in any year. (b) Formula for distribution.-- The department shall distribute to each county maintenance district: (1) an amount equal to the county's base allocation; plus (2) an amount based on the following incremental formula in which each county shall receive a portion of State highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations in excess of the total of all counties' base allocations, expressed in the following manner: ASHMA (40% RPQc + 15% BMDc + 30% LMc + 15% VMc). (c) Establishment of applicable data.-- The applicable data for all counties corresponding to each individual factor in the incremental formula in subsection (b) shall be established and certified by the Governor by May 1 of each year based on the best information available at that time for the immediately preceding five-year period with the exception of BMD. The submission of data relative to BMD shall only include the immediately preceding 12-month period beginning with fiscal year 1997-1998. In each subsequent fiscal year, an additional year of data relative to BMD shall be added until such time as data from a five-year period has been accumulated. (d) Effect of insufficient funds.-- In the event sufficient funds are not available to fully fund all county maintenance districts under the formula in subsection (b) due to the hold harmless provision in subsection (a), each county maintenance district receiving an increase above its base allocation shall have its share reduced in the proportion that the increase over its base allocation bears to the total increases over the base allocation of all counties entitled to an increase, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocations within the funding limit.

(a) Allocation.-- For eligible fiscal years up to and through the 1998-1999 fiscal year, 25% of the Commonwealth's total annual appropriation for the system of State aid established under section 9333 (relating to State system of aid to libraries), or a minimum of 25¢ per capita for each person residing in the municipalities of the libraries which qualify for basic aid, shall be allocated as basic aid. (b) Minimum financial effort.-- (1) Any local library which makes a minimum financial effort equal to one-half mill, for the municipalities on behalf of which it applies for aid, or $2 per capita for each person residing in those municipalities, whichever is less, and achieves the basic standards, shall qualify for basic State aid. The aid shall not be less than 25¢ for each person residing in the municipalities. (2) If the allocation for basic aid exceeds the amount necessary to pay the minimum rate, the entire allocation shall be distributed at a per capita rate which shall be determined by dividing the allocation by the number of persons in this Commonwealth on behalf of which local libraries and library systems apply and qualify for basic aid. In the first year in which a library applies for State aid, it shall qualify by making a minimum financial effort equal to one-quarter mill, or $1 per capita for each person residing in the municipalities, whichever is less. (c) Qualification.-- (1) In each of the succeeding five years, the library shall qualify for maximum State aid only when it increases its financial effort by the following scale of percentages of the difference between the financial effort with which the library initially qualified for State aid and a financial effort equal to one-half mill, or $2 per capita for each person residing in the municipalities for which it applies for aid, whichever is less: 1st succeeding year-20%; 2nd succeeding year-40%; 3rd succeeding year-60%; 4th succeeding year-80%; and 5th succeeding year-100%. (2) If the increase in any year is less than the percentage specified under paragraph (1), the amount of State aid shall be reduced by a percentage equal to one-fifth of the percentage which the difference between the required increase and the actual increase bears to the required increase multiplied by the number of years of participation in State aid beyond the first year. (d) Ineligibility.-- After the fifth succeeding year, a local library shall not be eligible for further State aid unless it makes a financial effort equal to one-half mill for the municipalities on behalf of which it applies for aid, or $2 per capita for each person residing in those municipalities, whichever is less.",

If, after paying the minimum amount set forth under this section, there is a balance in the allocation, the balance shall be prorated among the libraries and library systems which qualify for a larger amount of aid at the rate of 50¢ for each $1 of surplus financial effort rather than at the rate of 25¢ per capita.",

(a) Employer contribution rate.-- The amount of the total employer contributions shall be computed by the actuary as a percentage of the total compensation of all active members and active participants, as applicable, during the period for which the amount is determined and shall be so certified by the board. The total employer contribution rate shall be the sum of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) divided by the total compensation of all active members and active participants: (1) the final contribution amount computed by multiplying the final contribution rate calculated in subsection (h) by the total compensation of all active members; (2) the premium assistance contribution amount computed by multiplying the premium assistance contribution rate calculated in subsection (f) by the total compensation of all active members and active participants; and (3) the employer defined contributions as defined under section 8102 (relating to definitions). The actuarially required contribution shall be no less than the normal cost plus the cost to fully amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability calculated using actuarial methods and assumptions that are consistent with generally accepted actuarial standards and generally accepted accounting principles, including professional actuarial standards of practice. (b) Normal contribution rate.-- The normal contribution rate shall be determined after each actuarial valuation. Until all accrued liability contributions have been completed, the normal contribution rate shall be determined, on the basis of an annual interest rate and such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the board in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles, as a level percentage of the compensation of all active members, which percentage, if contributed from the start of their employment on the basis of their prospective compensation through their entire period of active school service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to them, in excess of that portion funded by their prospective member contributions, excluding the shared-risk contributions. In no case shall the employer's normal cost be less than zero. (c) Accrued liability contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2002, and ending June 30, 2011, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits of active members, except for the supplemental benefits provided in sections 8348 (relating to supplemental annuities), 8348.1 (relating to additional supplemental annuities), 8348.2 (relating to further additional supplemental annuities), 8348.3 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1994), 8348.4 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment), 8348.5 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1998), 8348.6 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2002) and 8348.7 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2003), in excess of the total assets in the fund (calculated by recognizing the actuarially expected investment return immediately and recognizing the difference between the actual investment return and the actuarially expected investment return over a five-year period), excluding the balance in the annuity reserve account, and of the present value of normal contributions and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members on July 1, 2002, during the remainder of their active service. (2) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2003, and ending June 30, 2011, the amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year, beginning July 1, 2002, except that, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2002, but before July 1, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded over a period of ten years from the first day of July, coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution for such additional legislative liabilities shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the first annual payment. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2011, the outstanding balance of the increase in accrued liability due to the change in benefits enacted in 2001 and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in fiscal year 2000-2001 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2002, and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in fiscal year 2001-2002 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2003. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded in equal dollar annual contributions over a period of ten years from the first day of July coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. (4) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund as a level percentage of compensation over a period of 24 years from July 1, 2011, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits calculated as of June 30, 2010, including the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 8348, 8348.1, 8348.2, 8348.3, 8348.4, 8348.5, 8348.6 and 8348.7, in excess of the actuarially calculated assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses each year in level annual installments over a ten-year period). In the event that the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2010, as a result of an increase in benefits determined on a total plan basis, such additional liability shall be funded as a level percentage of compensation over a period of ten years from the July 1 second succeeding the date such legislation is enacted. (5) For the fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2017, the actuarially calculated assets in the fund determined in accordance with paragraph (4) shall be no less than 70% and no more than 130% of market value. (d) Supplemental annuity contribution rate.-- (1) For the period of July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2011, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers required to provide for the payment of the supplemental annuities provided for in sections 8348, 8348.1, 8348.2, 8348.4 and 8348.5 shall be paid over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002. The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2002 provided for in section 8348.6 shall be as provided in section 8348.6(f). The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2003 provided for in section 8348.7 shall be as provided in section 8348.7(f). The amount of each annual supplemental annuities contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002. (2) For fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 8348, 8348.1, 8348.2, 8348.3, 8348.4, 8348.5, 8348.6 and 8348.7 shall be paid as part of the accrued liability contribution rate as provided for in subsection (c)(4), and there shall not be a separate supplemental annuity contribution rate attributable to those supplemental annuities. In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2010, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded as a level percentage of compensation over a period of ten years from the July 1 second succeeding the date such legislation is enacted. (e) Experience adjustment factor.-- (1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability, excluding the gains or losses on the assets of the health insurance account, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience, changes in actuarial assumptions, changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, active members making shared-risk contributions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized as a level percentage of compensation over a period of 24 years beginning with the July 1 second succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases. (2) (Reserved). (f) Premium assistance contribution rate.-- For each fiscal year beginning with July 1, 1991, the total contribution rate as calculated according to this section shall be increased annually in the full amount certified by the board as necessary to fund the premium assistance program in accordance with section 8509 (relating to health insurance premium assistance program), notwithstanding any other provisions of this section. (g) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.-- (1) The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate, calculated without regard for the costs added by legislation, to the prior year's final contribution rate. (2) If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate, calculated without regard for the costs added by legislation, is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all other fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not be applicable. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of the total compensation of all active members. (h) Final contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate is 5% of the total compensation of all active members. For each subsequent fiscal year for which the collared contribution rate is applicable, the final contribution rate shall be the collared contribution rate as calculated in subsection (g), plus the costs added by legislation. (2) For all other fiscal years, the final contribution rate shall be the actuarially required contribution rate, provided that the final contribution rate shall not be less than the normal contribution rate as provided in subsection (b). (i) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Actuarially required contribution rate.\" The sum of the following: (1) the normal contribution rate as calculated in subsection (b); (2) the accrued liability contribution rate as calculated in subsection (c); (3) the supplemental annuity contribution rate as calculated in subsection (d); (4) the experience adjustment factor as calculated in subsection (e); and (5) any costs added by legislation enacted prior to the last actuarial valuation. \"Costs added by legislation.\" The sum, if positive, of all changes in the actuarially required contribution rate resulting from legislation enacted in the year since the last actuarial valuation and not included in the determination of the prior year's final contribution rate, computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members certified by the actuary as sufficient to make the employer normal contributions and sufficient to amortize legislatively created changes in the unfunded actuarial liability as a level percentage of compensation over a period of ten years from the July 1 second succeeding the date of enactment.

      "text": "§ 8346. Termination of annuities. (a) General rule.-- If an annuitant returns to school service or enters or has entered State service and elects multiple service membership, any annuity payable to him under this part shall cease effective upon the date of his return to school service or entering State service without regard to whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member of the system or participant in the plan or, if a multiple service member, whether he is a mandatory, optional or prohibited member or participant of the State Employees' Retirement System or State Employees' Defined Contribution Plan; and, in the case of an annuity other than a disability annuity the present value of such annuity, adjusted for full coverage in the case of a joint coverage member who makes the appropriate back contributions for full coverage, shall be frozen as of the date such annuity ceases. An annuitant who is credited with an additional 10% of membership service as provided in section 8302(b.2) (relating to credited school service) and who returns to school service, except as provided in subsection (b), shall forfeit such credited service and shall have his frozen present value adjusted as if his 10% retirement incentive had not been applied to his account. In the event that the cost-of-living increase enacted December 18, 1979, occurred during the period of such State or school employment, the frozen present value shall be increased, on or after the member attains superannuation age, by the percent applicable had he not returned to service. (a.1) Return of benefits.-- In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 8345 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to school service or entering State service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 90 days or in the case of an active member or a State employee who is an active member of the State Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a State employee who is an active member of the State Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the State Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid. (a.2) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.-- If a former school employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and: (1) shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days; or (2) in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board for not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave. A repayment period under this paragraph may not exceed five years or a longer time as agreed to between the board and the member. (b) Return to school service during emergency.-- When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public or in the event of a shortage of appropriate subject certified teachers or other personnel, an annuitant or participant receiving distributions may be returned to school service for a period not to extend beyond the school year during which the emergency or shortage occurs, without loss of his annuity or distributions, provided that the annuitant meets the conditions set forth in subsection (b.2). The annuitant or participant receiving distributions shall not be entitled to earn any credited service, and no contributions may be made to the fund or the trust by the annuitant or participant receiving distributions, the employer or the Commonwealth on account of such employment. Such service shall not be subject to member or participant contributions or be eligible for qualification as creditable school service or for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions, voluntary contributions or employer defined contributions. (b.1) Return to school service in an extracurricular position.-- (1) An annuitant or participant receiving distributions may be employed under separate contract by a public school or charter school in an extracurricular position performed primarily outside regular instructional hours and not part of mandated curriculum without loss of annuity, provided that the annuitant meets the conditions set forth in subsection (b.2). The annuitant, the participant receiving distributions and the employer shall not make contributions to the member's savings account, the individual investment account or State accumulation account respectively for such service. Further, such contract shall contain a waiver whereby the annuitant waives any potential retirement benefits that could arise from the contract and releases the employer and the board from any liability for such benefits. Such service shall not be subject to member or participant contributions or be eligible for qualification as creditable school service or for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions or employer defined contributions. (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to abridge or limit any rights provided under a collective bargaining agreement or any rights provided under the act of July 23, 1970 (P.L.563, No.195), known as the Public Employe Relations Act. (3) For purposes of this subsection, the term \"extracurricular position\" means a contract position filled by an annuitant that is separate from the established academic course structure, including the position of athletic director. (b.2) Limitation on return to school service by an annuitant during emergency or in an extracurricular position.-- (1) An annuitant may return to school service under subsection (b) or (b.1), provided the annuitant otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (b) or (b.1) and has attained the age set forth in IRC § 401(a)(36) or the applicable \"normal retirement age\" in 26 C.F.R. § 1.401(a)-1(b)(2) (relating to post-ERISA qualified plans and qualified trusts; in general). (2) An annuitant who has not reached the age as set forth in IRC § 401(a)(36), or the applicable \"normal retirement age\" under 26 C.F.R. § 1.401(a)-1(b)(2), may return to service under subsection (b) or (b.1) provided the annuitant otherwise meets the requirements of subsection (b) or (b.1) and has had a break in service, as set forth in paragraph (3). (3) For purposes of this subsection, a break in service occurs when a member has a bona fide termination of service. The following factors will be considered in determining whether there had been a bona fide termination of service: (i) whether the change in the employment relationship is more than a formal or technical change, requiring the severing of the employment connection with the employer; (ii) whether there has been a reasonable anticipation or prearranged agreement between the member and the employer that a return to school service under this section shall take place; (iii) the amount of time that has elapsed from the date the member becomes an annuitant and the return to school service; (iv) whether the services are a continuation of the annuitant's previous service with the same employer; and (v) such other factors as the board may deem appropriate. (c) Subsequent discontinuance of service.-- Upon subsequent discontinuance of service, such member other than a former annuitant who had the effect of his frozen present value eliminated in accordance with subsection (d) or a former disability annuitant shall be entitled to an annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the sum of the present value as determined under subsection (a) and the present value of a maximum single life annuity based on years of service credited subsequent to reentry in the system and his final average salary computed by reference to his compensation during his entire period of school and State service. (d) Elimination of the effect of frozen present value.-- (1) An annuitant who returns to school service as an active member of the system and earns three eligibility points by performing credited school service or reemployment from USERRA leave following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, or an annuitant who enters State service and: (i) is a multiple service member; or (ii) who elects multiple service membership, and earns three eligibility points by performing credited State service, reemployment from USERRA leave or credited school service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, and who had the present value of his annuity frozen in accordance with subsection (a), shall qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value resulting from all previous periods of retirement eliminated, provided that all payments under Option 4 and annuity payments payable during previous periods of retirement plus interest as set forth in paragraph (3) shall be returned to the fund in the form of an actuarial adjustment to his subsequent benefits or in such form as the board may otherwise direct. (2) Upon subsequent discontinuance of service and the filing of an application for an annuity from the system, a former annuitant who qualifies to have the effect of a frozen present value eliminated under this subsection shall be entitled to receive the higher of either: (i) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the freezing of the former annuitant's account pursuant to subsection (a) had not occurred, adjusted by crediting Class T-C school service as Class T-D service as provided for in section 8305(c) (relating to classes of service) and further adjusted according to paragraph (3), provided that a former annuitant of the system or a former annuitant of the State Employees' Retirement System who retired under a provision of law granting additional service credit if termination of school or State service or retirement occurred during a specific period of time shall not be permitted to retain the additional service credit under the prior law when the annuity is computed for his most recent retirement; or (ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect on the frozen present value eliminated, unless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity. (3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement. The interest for each year shall be calculated based upon the annual interest rate adopted for that school year by the board for the calculation of the normal contribution rate pursuant to section 8328(b) (relating to actuarial cost method).

(2) Requires the system to provide no more than the total amount of benefits than the member would otherwise receive (determined on the basis of actuarial value) unless increased benefits are paid to the member or alternate payee based upon cost-of-living increases or increases based on other than actuarial value. (3) Specifies the amount or percentage of the member's benefits to be paid by the system to each such alternate payee or the manner in which the amount or percentage is to be determined. (4) Specifies the retirement option to be selected by the member upon retirement or states that the member may select any retirement option offered by this part upon retirement. (5) Specifies the name and last known mailing address, if any, of the member and the name and last known mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order and states that it is the responsibility of each alternate payee to keep a current mailing address on file with the system. (6) Does not grant an alternate payee any of the rights, options or privileges of a member under this part. (7) Requires the member to execute an authorization allowing each alternate payee to monitor the member's compliance with the terms of the domestic relations order through access to information concerning the member maintained by the system.

(a.1) Certification regarding participants.-- A domestic relations order pertaining to a participant shall be certified as an approved domestic relations order by the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, only if that order meets all of the following: (1) Does not require the plan to provide any type or form of benefit or any option applicable to members of the system or participants in the plan. (2) Does not require the segregation of the alternate payee's share of the participant's individual investment account into a subaccount or newly established individual account titled in the name of the alternate payee. (3) Does not require the plan to recover or distribute any funds that were distributed to the participant or at the participant's direction prior to the approval of the domestic relations order by the secretary of the board or his designated representative.

(5) States that the plan shall not be required to recoup or make good for losses in value to the participant's individual investment account incurred between the date of the valuation of the account used for equitable distribution purposes and the date of distribution to the alternate payee. (6) Specifies the amount or percentage of the participant's individual investment account to be paid to the alternate payee and the date upon which such valuation is based. (7) Specifies the name and last known mailing address, if any, of the participant and the name and last known mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order and states that it is the responsibility of each alternate payee to keep a current mailing address on file with the plan. (8) Does not grant an alternate payee the rights, privileges or options available to a participant. (9) Requires the participant to execute an authorization allowing each alternate payee to monitor the participant's compliance with the terms of the domestic relations order through access to information concerning the participant maintained by the plan. Any authorization granted under this section shall be construed as an authorization for the alternate payee to receive information concerning the participant that relates to the administration, calculation and payment of the alternate payee's share of the participant's account and not as an authorization to exercise the rights afforded to participants or obtain information that is not related to the administration, calculation and payment of the alternate payee's share of the participant's individual investment account. (10) Requires the immediate distribution of the alternate payee's share of the participant's individual investment account, which may be made by direct payment, eligible rollover or trustee-to-trustee transfer to another eligible plan or qualified account owned by the alternate payee. (11) In the case of a participant who is currently receiving distributions from the plan as of the date the domestic relations order is approved by the secretary of the board or his designated representative, may not order the board to pay the alternate payee more than the vested balance available in the participant's individual investment account as of the date the order is approved or require that distributions continue to the alternate payee after the death of the participant and final settlement of the participant's individual investment account. (b) Determination by secretary.-- Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of a domestic relations order, the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, shall determine whether the order is an approved domestic relations order and notify the member or participant and each alternate payee of this determination. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the exclusive remedy of any member, participant or alternate payee aggrieved by a decision of the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, shall be the right to an adjudication by the board under 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 (relating to practice and procedure) with appeal therefrom to the Commonwealth Court under 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 7 (relating to judicial review) and 42 Pa.C.S. § 763(a)(1) (relating to direct appeals from government agencies). (c) Other orders.-- The requirements for approval identified in subsections (a) and (a.1) shall not apply to any domestic relations order which is an order for support as that term is defined in 23 Pa.C.S. § 4302 (relating to definitions) or an order for the enforcement of arrearages as provided in 23 Pa.C.S. § 3703 (relating to enforcement of arrearages). These orders shall be approved to the extent that they do not attach moneys in excess of the limits on attachments as established by the laws of this Commonwealth and the United States, require distributions of benefits in a manner that would violate the laws of the United States, any other state or this Commonwealth or require the distribution of funds for support or enforcement of arrearages against any participant who is not receiving distributions from the plan at the time the order is entered. These orders may be approved notwithstanding any other provision of this part or the plan that would otherwise require a distribution of accumulated employer defined contributions in the form of an annuity or to require the purchase of an annuity. (d) Obligation discharged.-- Only the requirements of this part and any regulations promulgated hereunder shall be used to govern the approval or disapproval of a domestic relations order. Therefore, if the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, acts in accordance with the provisions of this part and any promulgated regulations in approving or disapproving a domestic relations order, then the obligations of the system or plan with respect to such approval or disapproval shall be discharged.

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d), the right of a person to a member's annuity, a State annuity, or retirement allowance, to the return of contributions, any benefit or right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this part, and the moneys in the fund and the trust are hereby exempt from any State or municipal tax, levy and sale, garnishment, attachment, the provisions of Article XIII.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code, or any other process whatsoever, and shall be unassignable. (a.1) Individual investment accounts and distributions.-- No participant or beneficiary, successor payee or alternate payee of a participant shall have the ability to commute, sell, assign, alienate, anticipate, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, commutate or otherwise transfer or convey any benefit or interest in an individual investment account or rights to receive or direct distributions under this part or under agreements entered into under this part except as otherwise provided in this part and in the case of either a member or a participant. (b) Forfeiture.-- (1) Rights under this part shall be subject to forfeiture as provided by the act of July 8, 1978 (P.L.752, No.140), known as the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act. Forfeitures under this subsection or under any other provision of law may not be applied to increase the benefits that any member would otherwise receive under this part. (2) In accordance with section 16(b) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act or 42 Pa.C.S. § 3352 (relating to pension rights), the accumulated mandatory participant contributions and accumulated voluntary contributions standing to the credit of a participant shall not be forfeited but shall be available for payment of fines and restitution as provided by law. Amounts in the trust that have been ordered to be distributed to an alternate payee as the result of an equitable distribution of marital property as part of an approved domestic relations order entered before the date of the order or action in a court or other tribunal resulting in a forfeiture of a participant's interest in the trust shall not be subject to the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act or 42 Pa.C.S. § 3352. Any accumulated employer defined contributions forfeited as a result of this subsection or other law shall be retained by the board and used for the payment of expenses of the plan. (c) Domestic relations order.-- Rights under this part shall be subject to attachment in favor of an alternate payee as set forth in an approved domestic relations order. (d) Direct rollover.-- Effective with distributions made on or after January 1, 1993, and notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan by way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this subsection, a \"distributee\" includes a member, a participant, a member's surviving spouse, a participant's surviving spouse, a member's former spouse who is an alternate payee under an approved domestic relations order, a participant's former spouse who is an alternate payee under an approved domestic relations order and anyone else authorized under the IRC and the plan terms approved by the board to have an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan by way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this subsection, the term \"eligible rollover distribution\" has the meaning given such term by IRC § 402(f)(2)(A) and \"eligible retirement plan\" has the meaning given such term by IRC § 402(c)(8)(B), except that a qualified trust shall be considered an eligible retirement plan only if it accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution; however, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an \"individual retirement account\" or an \"individual retirement annuity\" as those terms are defined in IRC § 408(a) and (b).
