The commission shall give to the hearing and decision of any such proceeding preference over all other proceedings, and decide the same as speedily as possible.

(e) Use of future test year.-- In discharging its burden of proof the utility may utilize a future test year or a fully projected future test year, which shall be the 12-month period beginning with the first month that the new rates will be placed in effect after application of the full suspension period permitted under section 1308(d) (relating to voluntary changes in rates).

      "text": "§ 510. Assessment for regulatory expenses upon public utilities. (a) Determination of assessment.-- Before November 1 of each year, the commission shall estimate its total expenditures in the administration of this part for the fiscal year beginning July of the following year, which estimate shall not exceed three-tenths of 1% of the total gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utilities and licensed entities under its jurisdiction for the preceding calendar year, except that the estimate may exceed this amount to reflect Federal funds received by the commission and funds received from other sources to perform functions that are unrelated to the regulation of public utilities and licensed entities. Such estimate shall be submitted to the Governor in accordance with section 610 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929. At the same time the commission submits its estimate to the Governor, the commission shall also submit that estimate to the General Assembly. The commission or its designated representatives shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Governor and the Senate and House Appropriations Committees regarding their estimates. The commission shall subtract from the final estimate: (1) The estimated fees to be collected pursuant to section 317 (relating to fees for services rendered by commission) during such fiscal year. (2) The estimated balance of the appropriation, specified in section 511 (relating to disposition, appropriation and disbursement of assessments and fees), to be carried over into such fiscal year from the preceding one. The remainder so determined, herein called the total assessment, shall be allocated to, and paid by, such public utilities in the manner prescribed. If the General Assembly fails to approve the commission's budget for the purposes of this part, by March 30, the commission shall assess public utilities on the basis of the last approved operating budget. At such time as the General Assembly approves the proposed budget the commission shall have the authority to make an adjustment in the assessments to reflect the approved budget. If, subsequent to the approval of the budget, the commission determines that a supplemental budget may be needed, the commission shall submit its request for that supplemental budget simultaneously to the Governor and the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. (b) Allocation of assessment.-- On or before March 31 of each year, every public utility shall file with the commission a statement under oath showing its gross intrastate operating revenues for the preceding calendar year. If any public utility shall fail to file such statement on or before March 31, the commission shall estimate such revenues, which estimate shall be binding upon the public utility for the purposes of this section. For each fiscal year, the allocation shall be made as follows: (1) The commission shall determine for the preceding calendar year the amount of its expenditures directly attributable to the regulation of each group of utilities furnishing the same kind of service, and debit the amount so determined to such group. The commission may, for purposes of the assessment, deem utilities rendering water, sewer or water and sewer service, as defined in the definition of \"public utility\" in section 102 (relating to definitions), as a utility group. (2) The commission shall also determine for the preceding calendar year the balance of its expenditures, not debited as aforesaid, and allocate such balance to each group in the proportion which the gross intrastate operating revenues of such group for that year bear to the gross intrastate operating revenues of all groups for that year. (3) The commission shall then allocate the total assessment prescribed by subsection (a) to each group in the proportion which the sum of the debits made to it bears to the sum of the debits made to all groups. (4) Each public utility within a group shall then be assessed for and shall pay to the commission such proportion of the amount allocated to its group as the gross intrastate operating revenues of the public utility for the preceding calendar year bear to the total gross intrastate operating revenues of its group for that year. (5) (Repealed). (c) Notice, hearing and payment.-- The commission shall give notice by registered or certified mail to each public utility of the amount lawfully charged against it under the provisions of this section, which amount shall be paid by the public utility within 30 days of receipt of such notice, unless the commission specifies on the notices sent to all public utilities an installment plan of payment, in which case each public utility shall pay each installment on or before the date specified therefor by the commission. Within 15 days after receipt of such notice, the public utility against which such assessment has been made may file with the commission objections setting out in detail the grounds upon which the objector regards such assessment to be excessive, erroneous, unlawful or invalid. The commission, after notice to the objector, shall hold a hearing upon such objections. After such hearing, the commission shall record upon its minutes its findings on the objections and shall transmit to the objector, by registered or certified mail, notice of the amount, if any, charged against it in accordance with such findings, which amount or any installment thereof then due, shall be paid by the objector within ten days after receipt of notice of the findings of the commission with respect to such objections. If any payment prescribed by this subsection is not made as aforesaid, the commission may suspend or revoke certificates of public convenience, certify automobile registrations to the Department of Transportation for suspension or revocation or, through the Department of Justice, may institute an appropriate action at law for the amount lawfully assessed, together with any additional cost incurred by the commission or the Department of Justice by virtue of such failure to pay. (d) Suits by public utilities.-- No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the purpose of restraining or in anywise delaying the collection or payment of any assessment made under subsections (a), (b) and (c), but every public utility against which an assessment is made shall pay the same as provided in subsection (c). Any public utility making any such payment may, at any time within two years from the date of payment, sue the Commonwealth in an action at law to recover the amount paid, or any part thereof, upon the ground that the assessment was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, in whole or in part, provided objections, as hereinbefore provided, were filed with the commission, and payment of the assessment was made under protest either as to all or part thereof. In any action for recovery of any payments made under this section, the claimant shall be entitled to raise every relevant issue of law, but the findings of fact made by the commission, pursuant to this section, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. Any records, books, data, documents, and memoranda relating to the expenses of the commission shall be admissible in evidence in any court and shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of their contents. If it is finally determined in any such action that all or any part of the assessment for which payment was made under protest was excessive, erroneous, unlawful, or invalid, the commission shall make a refund to the claimant out of the appropriation specified in section 511 as directed by the court. (e) Certain provisions not applicable.-- The provisions of this part relating to the judicial review of orders and determinations of the commission shall not be applicable to any findings, determinations, or assessments made under this section. The procedure in this section providing for the determination of the lawfulness of assessments and the recovery back of payments made pursuant to such assessment shall be exclusive of all other remedies and procedures. (f) Intent of section.-- It is the intent and purpose of this section that each public utility subject to this part shall advance to the commission its reasonable share of the cost of administering this part. The commission shall keep records of the costs incurred in connection with the administration and enforcement of this part or any other statute. The commission shall also keep a record of the manner in which it shall have computed the amount assessed against every public utility. Such records shall be open to inspection by all interested parties. The determination of such costs and assessments by the commission, and the records and data upon which the same are made, shall be considered prima facie correct; and in any proceeding instituted to challenge the reasonableness or correctness of any assessment under this section, the party challenging the same shall have the burden of proof. (g) Saving provision.-- This section does not affect or repeal any of the provisions of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), known as the \"Commonwealth Documents Law.\" (Dec. 18, 1980, P.L.1247, No.226, eff. imd.; July 10, 1986, P.L.1238, No.114, eff. imd.; Apr. 4, 1990, P.L.93, No.21, eff. 90 days; June 22, 1990, P.L.241, No.56, eff. 60 days; Dec. 30, 2002, P.L.2001, No.230, eff. 60 days; July 16, 2004, P.L.758, No.94; Oct. 22, 2014, P.L.2545, No.155, eff. 60 days) 2014 Amendment.

(b) Incentive for uprating.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations which establish a special cost recovery and shared benefits procedure for electric utilities and their ratepayers as an incentive to implement upratings as provided in subsection (a). Nothing in this section shall permit or require the commission to establish rates or procedures which are inconsistent with any other section in this title. (c) Cost of upgrading.-- Notwithstanding section 1315 (relating to limitation on consideration of certain costs for electric utilities) and subject to regulations promulgated by the commission, the commission may allow a portion of the prudently incurred costs, determined on a per megawatt basis and not to exceed 50% of the unit's undepreciated original cost per megawatt, of uprating the capability of an existing coal-fueled plant to use coal mined in Pennsylvania to be made a part of the rate base or otherwise included in the rates charged by the utility before such uprating is completed.

(a) Submission of estimate.-- No later than 30 days after construction of an electric generating unit is begun, either in this Commonwealth or in some other state, any public utility operating in this Commonwealth and owning any share in that unit shall submit to the commission an estimate of the cost of constructing that unit. If the public utility acquires ownership of any share in an electric generating unit which is under construction on the date of acquisition, the public utility shall, within 30 days of the date of acquisition, submit an estimate of the cost of constructing that unit which was formulated no later than 30 days from the beginning of construction. (b) Auditor in charge.-- For each electric generating unit under construction which falls under the provisions of this section, the commission shall designate an auditor in charge. In addition to the access to evidence granted by this section, each utility having a generating unit under construction shall promptly submit, to the appropriate auditor in charge, copies and a description of any change with respect to construction which may be expected to result in substantial variances in the construction cost. A summary of all other changes shall be submitted to the commission at such reasonable times as the commission shall require.

A summary of the audits mandated by this subsection shall be released to the public, and a complete copy of the audits shall be provided to the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate. (b) Management efficiency investigations.-- In addition to the audits mandated by subsection (a), the commission shall appoint a management efficiency investigator who shall periodically examine the management effectiveness and operating efficiency of all utilities required to be audited under subsection (a) and monitor the utility company responses to the audits required by subsection (a). For the purposes of carrying out the periodic audit required by this subsection and for carrying out the monitoring of audits required by subsection (a), the commission is hereby empowered to direct the management efficiency investigator to conduct such investigations through and with teams made up of commission staff and/or independent consulting firms; further, the commission may designate specific items of management effectiveness and operating efficiency to be investigated. The management efficiency investigator shall provide an annual report to the commission, the affected utility, the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate detailing the findings of such investigations. (c) Use of independent auditing firms.-- The commission may require an audit under subsection (a) or (b) to be performed by an independent consulting firm. When the commission, under either subsection (a) or (b), orders an audit to be performed by an independent consulting firm, the commission, after consultation with the utility, shall select the firm and require the utility to enter into a contract with the firm providing for payment of the firm by the utility. The terms of the contract shall include all reasonable expenses directly related to the performance of the audit or to the management efficiency investigation activities of independent consulting firms at the utility, as well as their preparation and presentation of testimony in any contested litigation which may be undertaken as a result of the audit findings under subsection (a) or (b).

(a) Eligibility.-- An operator who desires to receive an Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan shall submit a loan application to a lending institution. The application shall contain information demonstrating all of the following: (1) The applicant is an eligible borrower. (2) The best management practice for which the applicant is seeking a loan under this chapter has been approved by the commission or the commission's delegated agent for implementation. (3) Reasonable estimated costs for implementation of the approved best management practices sought to be funded have been provided by a project designer and concurred in by the commission or its delegated agent. (b) Implementation of program.-- The procedures applicable to the Agriculture-Linked Investment Program are as follows: (1) A lending institution wishing to participate in this program shall enter into an investment agreement with the Commonwealth. (2) A lending institution shall accept and review applications for loans from eligible borrowers. (3) A lending institution shall apply all usual lending standards, practices and forms to determine the creditworthiness of each eligible borrower. (4) Upon the lending institution's approval of an eligible borrower's loan application, the lending institution shall submit to the State Treasurer a request for the transfer of Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money in an amount equivalent to the amount of the loan approved, along with the application and any supporting documents filed in accordance with subsection (a). (5) The State Treasurer shall review the submitted request for the transfer of money and any supporting documentation for completeness prior to the transfer of Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money to the lending institution. (6) Upon determination of the completeness of the request for money and supporting documentation, the State Treasurer shall transfer to the lending institution money equivalent to the amount of the loan approved as follows: (i) if the lending institution is a State depository, the State Treasurer shall deposit the money in a collateralized certificate of deposit in the name of the Commonwealth which, except as provided in this chapter, conforms to the legal requirements for deposits in State depositories; or (ii) if the lending institution is an agricultural credit association affiliated with the Farm Credit Bank, the State Treasurer shall invest the money in bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities issued by the Farm Credit Bank. (7) The interest rate payable by lending institutions with respect to Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money shall be the interest rate on deposits in State depositories as established by the Board of Finance and Revenue from time to time, as otherwise provided by law, reduced by any subsidy that the commission may agree to pay under this chapter. (8) Principal balances of Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money with each lending institution shall be adjusted periodically as follows: (i) If the lending institution is a State depository, the principal amount of the certificate of deposit shall be adjusted not less than semiannually to reflect the reduction of the principal outstanding on the loan. The interest earned plus an amount equal to the principal repaid by the borrower shall be remitted not less than semiannually by the lending institution to the State Treasurer. (ii) If the lending institution is an agricultural credit association in conjunction with the Farm Credit Bank, the face value of the bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities outstanding shall, at the option of the State Treasurer, be periodically reduced by payment or redemption to match as nearly as possible the amount of principal outstanding on program loans, and the interest earned shall be payable to the State Treasurer as due in accordance with the terms of the bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities. (c) Terms of loan for borrowers.-- The terms of the loans for borrowers shall be: (1) Loans shall not exceed $250,000. (2) Loans shall be amortized over a term not to exceed 12 years. (3) The interest rate shall be established at or prior to the approval of the eligible borrower's loan application. (4) The interest rate charged by a lending institution to an eligible borrower shall reflect a percentage rate reduction below the prevailing market loan interest rate otherwise applicable to the borrower that is equal to the percentage rate reduction, if any, below the rate set by the Board of Finance and Revenue at which the certificates of deposit associated with the loan are placed or at which the investment in bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities of the Farm Credit Bank associated with the loan are made. (5) The interest rate charged by a lending institution to an eligible borrower may be either a fixed rate for the entire term of the loan or a variable rate which shall be adjusted semiannually to reflect changes in the interest rate established by the Board of Finance and Revenue for deposits in State depositories as otherwise provided by law. (6) Except as modified by the requirements of this chapter, a lending institution may apply its usual policies and practices with respect to the administration, collection and enforcement of loans issued under this chapter. (d) Interest subsidy.-- (1) The commission, at the commission's discretion, may enter into an agreement with the State Treasurer to subsidize the interest rate charged to eligible borrowers under this program with money provided to the commission under section 4(6) of the Conservation District Law or section 512 (relating to Nutrient Management Fund). (2) Under the agreement, the commission may designate from time to time a block of loans of a certain aggregate dollar amount which the commission wishes to subsidize and shall deposit in advance into a restricted escrow account in the State Treasury an amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be sufficient to make the yield over a 12-year term on the Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money to be transferred to lending institutions in connection with each designated block of subsidized loans equivalent to the yield the money otherwise would have earned at interest rates established from time to time by the Board of Finance and Revenue for deposits in State depositories as otherwise provided by law. Withdrawals from the restricted escrow account shall be made by the State Treasurer at the times when interest becomes due and payable from lending institutions on Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money associated with subsidized loans. (3) Among its terms, the agreement shall contain provisions: (i) To require the deposit of additional money into the restricted escrow account when the parties agree that the account balance has become insufficient to fully fund the subsidy. (ii) To permit the withdrawal of money from the escrow account when the parties agree that the account balance exceeds the amount needed to fully fund the subsidy. (4) The amount to be deposited into the restricted escrow account as to each block of loans designated by the commission shall be determined by calculating that the loans will be amortized over 12 years at a fixed rate of interest which is a number of percentage points below the prevailing market interest rate for such loans, to be designated by the commission.",

(a) Applicability.-- Design professional services shall be procured as provided in this section except as authorized by sections 514 (relating to small procurements), 515 (relating to sole source procurement) and 516 (relating to emergency procurement). (b) Policy.-- It is the policy of this Commonwealth to publicly announce all requirements for design professional services and to award contracts for design professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the types of services required. There shall be a committee to review the qualifications, experience and work of design professionals seeking contracts with purchasing agencies. (c) Selection committees for Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities.-- Where they are authorized by law to act as purchasing agency for design professional services, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities shall each establish as many selection committees as the department deems appropriate and a procedure for the selection of committee members. (d) Selection committee for all other Commonwealth agencies.-- Except as provided for in subsection (c), all purchasing agencies shall use the selection committee appointed by the Governor which shall be composed of five members, none of whom shall be employees of the Commonwealth or hold any elective office or office in any political party. The members shall be architects, engineers or other persons knowledgeable in construction. The members shall serve for terms of two years and shall not be removed except for cause. Of the original members, three shall serve for terms of two years and two for terms of one year. Thereafter, all terms shall be for two years. Each member shall be reimbursed for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred incident to attendance at meetings and to assigned duties and also a per diem allowance in accordance with Commonwealth travel policies. (e) Procedure for selection committees.-- The selection committees shall use the procedure set forth in this subsection: (1) The committee shall give public notice of projects requiring design services and publicly recommend to the purchasing agency three qualified design professionals for each project. (2) If desired, the committee may conduct discussions with three or more professionals regarding anticipated design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment. The committee shall select, based upon criteria established by the head of the purchasing agency, no less than three design professionals deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. In exercising its responsibility, the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) An equitable distribution of contracts to design professionals. (ii) Particular capability to perform the design or construction services for the contract being considered. (iii) Geographic proximity of the design professional to the proposed facility. (iv) The design professional selected has the necessary available personnel to perform the services required by the project. (v) Any other relevant circumstances peculiar to the proposed contract. (f) Design professionals.-- Except as provided for in subsection (g), the head of the purchasing agency shall select design professionals as follows: (1) Where the amount of the base construction allocation is less than $20,000,000, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The fee to be paid to the appointed design professional may be established by the selection committee or may be negotiated at the discretion of the head of the purchasing agency. The $20,000,000 threshold shall be adjusted by the department to reflect the annual percentage change in the Composite Construction Cost Index of the United States Department of Commerce occurring in the one-year period ending December 31 each year. (2) Where the amount of base construction allocation is in excess of or equal to $20,000,000, as annually adjusted, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee to begin contract negotiations. The fee to be paid to the design professional and the terms of the contract between the design professional and the department shall be negotiated by the head of the purchasing agency. In negotiating the contract and the fee, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, uniqueness and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the appointed design professional, negotiations with that design professional shall be terminated, and the head of the purchasing agency shall commence negotiations with one of the other firms chosen by the selection committee. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the second firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall terminate negotiations with the second design professional and commence negotiation with the third firm. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall choose additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this subsection until an agreement is reached. (g) Selection method for Department of Transportation, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Protection and State-affiliated entities.-- In the event the Department of Transportation, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection or a State-affiliated entity otherwise authorized by law to use its own selection committee requires the services of a design professional, the head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall negotiate with the firm determined to be the highest qualified firm for design professional services at a fee which is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth. In making this decision, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee he determines to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The head of the purchasing agency shall then undertake negotiations with the firm he determines to be the second highest qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the third highest qualified firm. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the committee shall select additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

(a) General rule.-- If the interest of an owner in a vehicle passes to another other than by voluntary transfer, the transferee shall, except as otherwise provided, promptly mail or deliver to the department the last certificate of title, if available, and shall apply for a new certificate of title on a form prescribed and furnished by the department. The application shall be accompanied by such instruments or documents of authority, or certified copies thereof, as may be sufficient or required by law to evidence or effect a transfer of title or interest in or to chattels in such case. (b) Transfer to surviving spouse.-- Transfer of a certificate of title to a surviving spouse, or any person designated by the spouse, may be made without the necessity of filing for letters of administration notwithstanding the fact that there are minor children surviving the decedent provided the surviving spouse files an affidavit that all the debts of the decedent have been paid. (c) Surrender of certificate.-- A person holding a certificate of title whose interest in a vehicle has been extinguished or transferred other than by voluntary transfer shall immediately surrender the certificate of title to the person to whom the right to possession of the vehicle has passed. Upon request of the department, such person shall mail or deliver the certificate to the department.

Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure for District Justices No. 482(10), as amended April 25, 1979, provided that section 1114 shall not be deemed suspended or affected. Rules 401 through 482 relate to execution of judgments for the payment of money rendered by district justices. Act 207 of 2004 changed justices of the peace to magisterial district judges. Rule 482 can now be found in Rules of Conduct, Office Standards and Civil Procedure for Magisterial District Judges. Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure No. 3159(b)(11), adopted April 20, 1998, provided that section 1114 shall not be deemed suspended or affected by Rules 3101 through 3149 relating to enforcement of money judgments for the payment of money.

(a) Eligible applicants.-- The following may apply for financial assistance for operating expenses under this section: (1) The governing body of a municipality or an instrumentality of a municipality. (2) A Commonwealth agency or instrumentality. (3) A local transportation organization. (b) Applications.-- In addition to information required under section 1507 (relating to application and approval process), an application for financial assistance under this section shall include the applicant's reasonable estimates of operating revenue and government subsidies sufficient to cover all projected operating expenses. (c) Distribution formula.-- (1) No later than 15 business days after the effective date of this section, the department shall forward to the Legislative Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin the base operating allocation for each local transportation organization. (1.1) For purposes of determining the amount of assistance available for distribution under this subsection, in addition to the amounts allocated under section 1506(e)(1)(relating to fund), an amount equal to the revenue in the Public Transportation Assistance Fund dedicated pursuant to law shall be included. (2) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, each qualifying local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance which shall consist of the following: (i) Its base operating allocation multiplied by 1.0506. (ii) An additional amount which shall be allocated based on the following distribution formula: (A) Twenty-five percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of passengers. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.25. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of passengers. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of passengers for all local transportation organizations. (B) Ten percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of senior passengers to offset free fares for senior passengers. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.10. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of senior passengers. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of senior passengers for all local transportation organizations. (C) Thirty-five percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of revenue vehicle hours. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.35. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of revenue vehicle hours. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total of the revenue vehicle hours for all local transportation organizations. (D) Thirty percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of revenue vehicle miles. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.30. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of revenue vehicle miles. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of revenue vehicle miles for all local transportation organizations. (3) For the 2007-2008 fiscal year, no local transportation organization shall receive total financial assistance under this subsection that would be more than 50% higher than the amount it receives under paragraph (2)(i). For each subsequent fiscal year, the increase in the total financial assistance provided to each local transportation organization shall not exceed 20% of the prior year allocation. (c.1) Minimum.-- No local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance under this section in an amount less than the amount received in the previous fiscal year. (d) Local match requirements.-- (1) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, except as provided under paragraph (2), financial assistance provided under this section shall be matched by local or private cash funding in an amount not less than the greater of: (i) 15% of the amount of the financial assistance being provided; or (ii) the amount required under former section 1311(d) (relating to use of funds distributed) for fiscal year 2006-2007. (2) Beginning in fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, if the local matching funds provided are less than 15% of the amount of financial assistance received, the local transportation organization's required local matching funds shall increase annually in order to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). The local matching funds shall be increased annually by a minimum of 5% above the amount of local matching funds provided in the previous fiscal year unless a lesser amount is necessary to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). (3) Eligible local matching funds shall consist only of cash contributions provided by one or more municipalities or counties. The amount of the match and the time period during which the match must continue to be available shall be specified in the financial assistance agreement. Funding provided by local and private entities, including advertising or naming rights, may qualify as local matching funds to the extent they provide for the cost of transit service that is open to the public. The following shall not be considered local matching funds: (i) Any form of transit operating revenue or other forms of transit income provided by the local transportation organization. (ii) Funds used to replace fares. (4) A municipality in a metropolitan area which is a member of a local transportation organization is authorized to provide annual financial assistance from current revenues to the local transportation organization of which it is a member or enter into a long-term agreement for payment of money to assist in defraying the costs of operation, maintenance and debt service of the local transportation organization or of a particular public transportation project of a local transportation organization. The obligation of a municipality under an agreement pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered to be a part of the indebtedness of the municipality, nor shall the obligation be deemed to impair the status of any indebtedness of the municipality which would otherwise be considered self-sustaining. (e) Performance reviews.-- (1) The department may conduct performance reviews of an award recipient under this section to determine the effectiveness of the financial assistance. Reviews shall be conducted at regular intervals as established by the department in consultation with the management of the award recipient. After completion of a review, the department shall issue a report that: (i) highlights exceptional performance and identifies any problems that need to be resolved; (ii) assesses performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of the financial assistance; (iii) makes recommendations on follow-up actions required to remedy any problem identified; and (iv) provides an action plan documenting who should perform the recommended actions and a time frame within which they should be performed. (2) The department shall deliver the report to the Governor, to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the Senate and to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives. The department's regulations shall contain a description of the impact on both the amount of, and future eligibility for, financial assistance under this chapter based upon the degree to which the local transportation organization complies with the recommendations in the report. The department shall develop a list of best practices revealed by the reports issued under this subsection and shall post them on the department's Internet website. (f) Performance criteria.-- Criteria used for the reviews conducted under subsection (e) shall consist of passengers per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per revenue vehicle hour, operating revenue per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per passenger and other items as the department may establish. The department's regulations shall set forth the minimum system performance criteria based upon comparison of the award recipient to its past performance and to its peers that an award recipient must satisfy. (g) Failure to satisfy minimum performance criteria.-- (1) If a performance review conducted under subsection (e) reveals that the performance of an award recipient's transportation system has decreased compared to performance determined through a prior review, the department may, upon the written request of an award recipient, waive any requirement for a reduction in the amount of financial assistance to be awarded under this section for a reasonable time period to allow the award recipient to bring the system back to the required performance level. The award recipient shall provide written justification for providing a time period longer than two years. In order to obtain the waiver for the period requested, the award recipient must do all of the following: (i) Develop an action plan to improve system performance that contains key measurable milestones. The action plan must be acceptable to the department and must be approved by the department in writing. (ii) Submit quarterly progress reports on the action plan to the department. (2) The department shall review and evaluate the award recipient's progress to determine if the system has improved. If the system has improved, the award recipient will remain eligible for full formula funding as determined under subsection (c). If the system has not improved by the end of the waiver period, the waiver will be withdrawn. Expenses incurred by the award recipient as a result of the failure of the award recipient's system to meet the minimum performance criteria shall be borne by the award recipient. (h) Adjustments to minimum performance criteria.-- Upon written request of an award recipient, the department may adjust the minimum performance criteria described in subsection (g) in a given year if the performance of the award recipient's system is adversely affected by circumstances which are beyond the award recipient's control. Examples are labor strikes, infrastructure failures and natural disasters. The request must include the award recipient's reasons for seeking the adjustment. Cross References.

(b) Examination of applicants for renewal.-- The department may require persons applying for renewal of a driver's license to take and successfully pass a physical examination or a vision examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist, or both examinations, if the department has reason to believe, either based on knowledge of the person or on statistical inference, that the person may be a traffic safety hazard.

(a) General rule.-- This subpart applies to all cooperatives created within this Commonwealth after the effective date of this subpart, but, if such a cooperative contains only units restricted to nonresidential use, it is subject only to sections 4106 (relating to applicability of local ordinances, regulations and building codes) and 4107 (relating to eminent domain) unless the declaration provides that the entire subpart is applicable. (b) Existing cooperatives.-- Except as provided in subsection (c), sections 4106, 4107, 4203 (relating to construction and validity of declaration and bylaws), 4219 (relating to master associations), 4220 (relating to merger or consolidation of cooperatives), 4302(a)(1) through (6) and (11) through (17) (relating to powers of association), 4311 (relating to tort and contract liability), 4315 (relating to lien for assessments), 4317 (relating to association records), 4319 (relating to termination of cooperative interest), 4409 (relating to resales of cooperative interests) and 4415 (relating to effect of violations on rights of action), and section 4103 (relating to definitions) to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subpart and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. By compliance with the requirements of section 4201 (relating to creation of cooperative ownership), a cooperative created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart may be made subject to all of the provisions of this subpart, effective as of the date of recordation of the document or documents specified in section 4201, without in any way terminating the cooperative status of the property or in any way affecting any lien or encumbrance on the property, if the terms of such document or documents have been approved by all the persons whose actions would have been required to effect the termination of the cooperative pursuant to its governing documents in effect at the time such approval is given, provided, however, that such action shall not increase the obligations or responsibilities of a declarant, as such and not as a proprietary lessee, without the joinder of the declarant in the document or documents required by section 4201. (b.1) Retroactivity.-- (1) Sections 4103, 4108 (relating to supplemental general principles of law applicable), 4112 (relating to obligation of good faith), 4216 (relating to amendment of declaration), 4217(g) (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), 4302(a)(8)(i) and (9), 4303(a), (b) and (c) (relating to executive board members and officers), 4307 (relating to upkeep of cooperative), 4314 (relating to assessments for common expenses) and 4316 (relating to other liens affecting cooperative), to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. (2) Section 4303(d), to the extent necessary in construing that subsection, applies to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but the subsection applies only with respect to events and circumstances occurring 180 days after the effective date of this subsection and does not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those cooperatives. (c) Units restricted to nonresidential use.-- If a cooperative created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains only units restricted to nonresidential use, it is subject only to sections 4106 and 4107 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that cooperative from the date such amended declaration is recorded as required for a declaration under section 4201. (d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart. (2) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made pursuant to this subpart. An amendment to the declaration or bylaws authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the declaration and bylaws being amended. If any such amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this subpart, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in this subpart also apply to that person. (e) Cooperative interests outside Commonwealth.-- This subpart does not apply to cooperative interests located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions (sections 4401 through 4408) apply to all cooperative interests offered within this Commonwealth for which either the contract for disposition is executed by any party within this Commonwealth or the disposition is effectuated within this Commonwealth unless exempt under section 4401(b) (relating to applicability; waiver). (f) Liens and security interests.-- The enactment of this subpart shall not affect any lien upon a cooperative or any lien upon or security interest in any property of the association or in any cooperative interest if such lien or security interest shall have been perfected prior to the effective date of this subpart.

The declaration may specify a smaller number only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use. (b) Limitation of action to challenge amendment.-- No action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted by the association pursuant to this section may be brought more than six months after the amendment is recorded. (c) Recording amendment.-- The following shall apply: (1) Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in every county in which any portion of the cooperative is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and is effective only upon recordation. In cases where the amendment is executed by the association, it shall be indexed in the name of the cooperative and the association in both the grantor and the grantee index.

If required by the county, an amendment may be indexed against a parcel assigned to each unit within the cooperative, but no fees shall be charged to each unit unless the indexing against each parcel is requested by the declarant or association.

(2) Change the allocated interests of a cooperative interest without the approval of the proprietary lessee who owns such cooperative interest. (3) Change the uses to which any unit is restricted without the approval of the proprietary lessee of such unit. (e) Officer authorized to execute amendment.-- Amendments to the declaration required by this subpart to be recorded by the association shall be prepared, executed, recorded and certified on behalf of the association by any officer of the association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of designation, by the president of the association. (f) Corrective amendments.-- Except as otherwise provided in the declaration, if any amendment to the declaration is necessary in the judgment of the executive board to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision of the declaration that is defective, missing or inconsistent with any other provision thereof or with this subpart or if an amendment is necessary in the judgment of the executive board to conform to the requirements of any agency or entity that has established national or regional standards with respect to loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on units in cooperative projects (such as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), to comply with any statute, regulation, code or ordinance which may now or hereafter be made applicable to the cooperative or association, or to make a reasonable accommodation or permit a reasonable modification in favor of handicapped, as may be defined by prevailing Federal or State laws or regulations applicable to the association, proprietary lessees, residents or employees, then, at any time and from time to time, the executive board may at its discretion effect an appropriate corrective amendment without the approval of the proprietary lessees or the holders of any liens on all or any part of the cooperative, upon receipt by the executive board of an opinion from legal counsel who is independent from the declarant to the effect that the proposed amendment is permitted by the terms of this subsection.

(a) Number of votes required.-- Except: (1) in the case of the taking of all of the units by eminent domain (section 4107); (2) in the case of foreclosure of a security interest against the entire cooperative which has priority over the declaration or which is subordinate to a declaration that expressly provides that the holder of the security interest has the right to terminate the cooperative when the foreclosure of the security interest has been consummated; or (3) in the case of the expiration or termination of a lease which has priority over the declaration (unless a contrary intent is expressly stated in the lease); cooperative ownership may be terminated only at a meeting of the association and by the vote, in person or by proxy, of proprietary lessees of cooperative interests to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the cooperative are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. (b) Execution and recording of termination agreement.-- An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of proprietary lessees. The termination agreement must specify the date it was first executed or ratified by a proprietary lessee. If, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real estate in the cooperative is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the terms of the sale. The termination agreement will become null and void unless it is recorded on or before the earlier of: (1) The expiration of the year from the date and all ratifications thereof it was first executed and ratified by a proprietary lessee. (2) Such date as shall be specified in the termination agreement. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the cooperative is situated in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and indexed in the name of the cooperative and the association in both the grantor index and the grantee index. A termination agreement is effective only upon recordation. (c) Status if real estate sold.-- The association, on behalf of the proprietary lessees, may contract for the sale of real estate in the cooperative, but the contract is not binding until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Except to the extent that any provisions in the declaration limit the amount that may be received by a proprietary lessee upon termination (section 4205(a)(10)), proceeds of the sale must be distributed to holders of liens against the association, against the cooperative interests and to proprietary lessees, all as their interests may appear, in accordance with subsections (d) and (e) with proprietary lessees being entitled to receive the entire balance of the association's assets, after payment of all such lienholders, pursuant to subsection (e), except that, in the case of a limited equity cooperative with a declaration of the type described in section 4321(e) (relating to limited equity cooperatives), the provisions of that section shall govern. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each proprietary lessee and his successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of that occupancy, each proprietary lessee and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on proprietary lessees by this subpart or the declaration. (d) Priority of liens.-- Following termination of the cooperative, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for proprietary lessees and holders of liens against the association and the cooperative interests as their interests may appear. The declaration may provide that all creditors of the association have priority over any interests of proprietary lessees and creditors of proprietary lessees. In that event, following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative which were perfected before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lienholder, and any other creditor of the association is to be treated as if he had perfected a lien against the cooperative immediately before termination. Unless the declaration provides that all creditors of the association have that priority: (1) The lien of each creditor of the association which was perfected against the association before termination becomes, upon termination, a lien against each cooperative interest as of the date the lien was perfected. (2) Any other creditor of the association is to be treated upon termination as if he had perfected a lien against the cooperative interests immediately before termination. (3) The amount of the lien of an association's creditor described in paragraphs (1) and (2) against each of the cooperative interests must be proportionate to the ratio which that cooperative interest's common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all of the cooperative interests. (4) The one lien, unless the declaration designates a greater number, against each proprietary lessee which was perfected prior to any other liens against the proprietary lessee and before termination continues as a lien against the proprietary lessee's cooperative interest as of the date the lien was perfected. (5) Any other creditor of a proprietary lessee is to be treated upon termination as if he had perfected a lien against that proprietary lessee immediately before termination. (6) The assets of the association shall be distributed to all proprietary lessees and all lienholders against their cooperative interests as their interests may appear in the order described in paragraphs (1) through (5), and creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any proprietary lessee in excess of the amount of the creditor's lien against that proprietary lessee's cooperative interest. Regardless of the priority given to creditors of the association, no proprietary lessee shall have any personal liability to a creditor of the association beyond such proprietary lessee's cooperative interest. (e) Valuation of proprietary lessee's interest.-- The declaration may provide that the respective interests of proprietary lessees referred to in subsections (c) and (d) are the fair market values of the cooperative interests as of a date no earlier than six months prior to the termination as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the proprietary lessees at least 30 days prior to a meeting of the association at which meeting the appraisal will be deemed approved unless it is rejected by vote, in person or by proxy, of proprietary lessees holding more than 50% of the votes in the association. If the declaration provides for such an appraisal procedure, the proportion of any proprietary lessee's interest to that of all proprietary lessees is determined by dividing the fair market value of that proprietary lessee's cooperative interest by the total fair market values of all the cooperative interests. If the declaration does not provide for such an appraisal procedure or if the appraisal is rejected by the requisite number of votes in the association, the interests of all proprietary lessees are their respective ownership interests in the association immediately before the termination. If the declaration provides for an appraisal procedure, there shall be no vote taken among the proprietary lessees as to whether or not the cooperative form of ownership should be terminated until after the vote is first taken as to whether or not the appraisal should be approved. (f) Termination by successor in title.-- In the case of a foreclosure of a lien against the entire cooperative or in the case of the expiration or termination of a lease which has priority over the declaration, the successor in title shall have the right to terminate the cooperative. (g) Ineffectiveness of termination provision.-- In the case of a declaration that contains no provision expressly providing for a means of terminating the cooperative other than a provision providing for a self-executing termination upon a specific date or upon the expiration of a specific time period, such termination provision shall be deemed ineffective if no earlier than five years before the date the cooperative would otherwise be terminated the owners of at least 80% of the units in the cooperative vote that the self-executing termination provision shall be annulled, in which event the self-executing termination provision shall have no force or effect.

(b) Exercise of powers of association.-- Unless a master association is acting in the capacity of an association described in section 4301 (relating to organization of association), it may exercise the powers set forth in section 4302 only to the extent expressly permitted in the declarations of the cooperatives which are part of the master association or expressly described in the delegations of power from those cooperatives to the master association. (c) Liability for exercise of delegated powers.-- If the declaration of any cooperative provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board have no liability for the acts of omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following delegation. The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the cooperative association whose powers are delegated thereto and the proprietary lessees of such cooperative on the same basis as officers and executive board members of such cooperative immediately before such delegation of power. (d) Rights and liabilities of proprietary lessees.-- The rights and responsibilities of proprietary lessees with respect to the association set forth in sections 4303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 4308 (relating to meetings), 4309 (relating to quorums), 4310 (relating to voting; proxies), 4312 (relating to conveyance or encumbrance of cooperative) and 4320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association only to those persons who elect the board of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise proprietary lessees within the meaning of this subpart. (e) Election of executive board.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4303(f) with respect to the election of the executive board of an association by all proprietary lessees after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 4301, the certificate of incorporation or other instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each cooperative, the powers of which are assigned by the declaration or delegated to the master association, may provide that the executive board of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways: (1) All proprietary lessees of all cooperatives subject to the master association may elect all members of that executive board. (2) All members of the executive boards of all cooperatives subject to the master association may elect all members of that executive board. (3) All proprietary lessees of each cooperative subject to the master association may elect specified members of the executive board. (4) All members of the executive boards of each cooperative subject to the master association may elect specified members of that executive board. (e.1) Independent reviewer.-- The certificate of incorporation or other instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each cooperative, the powers of which are assigned by the declaration or delegated to the master association, shall provide that a vote by a proprietary lessee in an election of the executive board of an association must be submitted by the proprietary lessee to an independent reviewer who shall tally the results of the election and certify the results to the executive board and proprietary lessees. In order to be eligible to vote in the election, a proprietary lessee shall be in good standing with the master association. The executive board shall present the official election results based on the certified election report from the independent reviewer at a meeting of the proprietary lessees and shall enter the results in the meeting records. All votes by proprietary lessees under this subsection shall be submitted to the independent reviewer in accordance with the approved methods of voting as provided under this subpart. This subsection shall only apply to a cooperative with at least 500 units. If a cooperative has less than 500 units, the master association may opt in to the requirements under this subsection by a vote of at least 51% of the votes collected from the unit owners in person, electronically or by absentee ballot which are in favor of the requirements under this subsection. (f) When section applicable to cooperative.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to a cooperative if and when: (1) there occurs either a date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the cooperative; (2) there occurs an event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable, and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that: (i) such event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the cooperative; and (ii) that a copy of such instrument has been sent to all proprietary lessees; or (3) the declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the cooperative and that a copy of the instrument has been sent to the executive board and all proprietary lessees. Paragraph (3) shall be applicable only if the declarant expressly reserved in the declaration, pursuant to section 4205(a)(8) (relating to contents of declaration), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the cooperative and only if the instrument exercising such right is recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right.

(a) General rule.-- Any two or more cooperatives, by agreement of the proprietary lessees as provided in subsection (b), may be merged or consolidated into a single cooperative.

(2) The department has certified that it developed a program plan based on the assessment conducted under paragraph (1) that is designed to reduce the risk of recidivism through the use of recidivism risk reduction incentive programs authorized and approved under this chapter that are appropriate for that particular inmate. (3) The department advised the inmate that the inmate is required to successfully complete the program plan. (4) The inmate has successfully completed all required recidivism risk reduction incentive programs or other programs designated in the program plan. (5) The inmate has maintained a good conduct record following the imposition of the recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum sentence. (6) The reentry plan for the inmate is adequate.

(2) Prohibit the department from including appropriate community works or public service projects as part of the program plan. (3) Prohibit the department from making modifications to the program plan at any time in order to ensure appropriate treatment and recidivism risk reduction incentive program placement.

(a) General rule.-- Except as provided in subsection (b), neither the department nor any other department or agency of the executive branch of State government shall expend any public funds for the establishment and administration of any system for the periodic inspection of emissions or emission systems of motor vehicles. (b) Exception.-- The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply when the secretary shall certify that a system is required to comply with Federal law and is necessary for the Commonwealth to receive or avoid the loss of Federal funds in which case the department may establish and administer such a system for motor vehicles registered in areas where periodic inspection of emissions or emission systems of motor vehicles is required by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States or decrees of the courts of the United States. (b.1) Further exception.-- (1) The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply if the secretary shall certify that a system is required to comply with the Clean Air Act (Public Law 95-95, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.) and subsequent amendments or a final decree of a Federal court and is necessary for the Commonwealth to receive or avoid the loss of Federal funds, in which case the department shall establish and administer an enhanced emission inspection program. This program shall be established in all areas of this Commonwealth where the secretary certifies by publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin that a system is required in order to comply with Federal law. Any area, counties, county or portion thereof certified to be in the program by the secretary must be mandated to be in the program by Federal law. If a petition is required to be sent to the Federal Government in order for any counties, county or portions of any county to be exempted from the emission inspection program, the secretary shall petition the Federal Government on behalf of any counties, county or portion of any county that may qualify for an exemption. In cases where more than one county within a metropolitan statistical area may be exempted from the emissions inspection program, the county with the lowest population per square mile shall be exempted first. In cases where only portions of one county may be exempted from the emissions inspection program, the areas with the lowest population per area of postal zip code coverage region shall be exempted first. If the secretary establishes a centralized inspection program, the following limitations shall be applicable: (i) Vehicle emission inspection shall be on a biennial basis. (ii) No vehicle repairs or vehicle safety inspections shall be performed at any centralized emission inspection facility. (iii) No contractor providing centralized inspection shall own or have any business interest in any vehicle repair facility in this Commonwealth.

(v) The department shall promulgate regulations for the conduct, supervision and qualification of a contractor, its principals, employees or agents providing centralized emission testing which shall include a schedule of offenses punishable by fine of up to $20,000 and shall make provision for the discipline, termination, suspension and/or debarment of a contractor, its principals, employees or agents for the violation of a regulation pertaining to the emission testing program. (2) At least 60 days prior to the implementation of any enhanced emission inspection program developed under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall certify by notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin that an enhanced emission inspection program will commence. (b.2) Restrictions on exceptions.-- Notwithstanding any other provision or requirement contained in this title, no provision or requirement of this section shall be more stringent or restrictive than those required by the Clean Air Act. No allowable vehicle emission standard shall be more restrictive than that originally certified for the subject vehicle at the time of manufacture. (b.3) Fees.-- (Repealed). (b.4) Audits.-- (Repealed). (b.5) Repairs covered by warranty.-- The inspection shall be performed so that when vehicles tested under warranty are repaired, such repairs must be covered by the vehicle manufacturer's warranty provisions.

(ii) The subject vehicle is exempt pursuant to the provisions of section 4702(g) (relating to requirement for periodic inspection of vehicles). (2) When a subject vehicle has failed the emission inspection test and continues to fail after the owner has expended an amount at least equal to the total cost limitation as provided in paragraph (3), the owner may apply for a waiver. For the purpose of determining qualification for a waiver, the cost of necessary repairs shall not include the costs covered by any warranty, insurance policy or prepaid maintenance agreement or the costs as referred to in paragraph (4). (3) The waiver limit shall be the minimum required by Federal law. The costs mandated by this subsection do not include any costs recoverable under warranty, insurance policy or prepaid maintenance agreement. (4) Any expenses incurred in the repair of emission control devices found to be tampered with or rendered inoperative or which are not installed shall not be included in the total cost limitation of paragraph (3). (5) It is unlawful to operate a subject vehicle without evidence of emission inspection or certification by an authorized agent, provided that it shall be lawful for a motor vehicle to be operated by the vehicle owner while en route to an emissions inspection station or to a vehicle repair facility where an appointment for emissions-related repairs has been scheduled and, provided further, that such operation occurs no later than ten days after the expiration of valid evidence of emission inspection issued under this title. (6) Subject vehicles presented for emission inspection after the assigned emission inspection deadline shall be charged $10 for each month or portion thereof past the due date in addition to the emission inspection fee, except as provided in regulations promulgated by the department.

The vehicle or the mass transit vehicle may be driven for up to five days if it displays the portion of the old windshield containing the evidence of emission inspection as prescribed in department regulations. Within the five-day period, an official emission inspection station may affix to the vehicle or mass transit vehicle another evidence of emission inspection for the same inspection period without reinspecting the vehicle or mass transit vehicle in exchange for the portion of the old windshield containing the evidence of emission inspection. A fee of no more than $2 plus the fee paid to access the department's computer to enter the evidence of emission inspection into the system may be charged for exchanging evidence of emission inspection. (d) Coordination with vehicle registration.-- (Deleted by amendment). (e) Regulations.-- Upon certification by the secretary of the need to comply with Federal law, the department shall promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to implement the emission inspection program but it shall not promulgate a regulation that would require safety inspection stations to also perform emission control inspections. Regulations promulgated by the department relating to the enhanced emission inspection program shall not be subject to the proposed rulemaking provisions of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law, or the act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as the Regulatory Review Act. (f) Scope.-- (Repealed). (g) Alternative enhanced emission inspection program.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (f), the department shall comply with all of the following requirements: (1) The department shall immediately suspend the development and implementation of a centralized, test-only vehicle emission inspection program until March 31, 1995. (2) The department shall immediately notify the Environmental Protection Agency that the Commonwealth is developing an alternative vehicle emission program and intends to seek its approval of the plan in accordance with the requirements of the Federal law. (3) The department shall develop and submit to the Environmental Protection Agency an alternative enhanced vehicle emission inspection program for approval which meets the requirements of Federal law and consists of a decentralized test and repair program or a hybrid program which combines both decentralized test and repair and test-only components. The decentralized test program may contain an additional component which will test and repair only those components necessary to achieve compliance with Federal clean air standards. As part of this decentralized test program, the department shall utilize the newest and most efficient technologies, including, but not limited to, remote roadside testing, identification and targeting of gross polluting vehicles and alternative equipment to existing inspection technology. The department may incorporate pilot programs and demonstration projects which achieve and enhance vehicle emissions reductions. (4) On the effective date of this subsection, the department shall be immediately prohibited from expending any funds or allowing any other action in furtherance of the development and implementation of a centralized, test-only vehicle emission inspection program until the Environmental Protection Agency approves the decentralized or hybrid system proposed under paragraph (3). Any funds expended by the department after the approval of the program by the Environmental Protection Agency shall be limited to the implementation of the revised vehicle inspection program. (h) Removal from Ozone Transport Commission.-- The Governor shall take the steps necessary to obtain Environmental Protection Agency approval to remove all areas of the Commonwealth from the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission region that are now classified or in the future will be classified as in attainment of the Federal ozone pollution standard or which are unclassified for the purpose of imposing an enhanced vehicle emission system inspection program and other air pollution control measures. The Governor shall initiate the actions necessary under this section no later than 60 days after the effective date of this section. (i) Suspension of program.-- The Governor shall immediately suspend the implementation and enforcement of the Employer Trip Reduction Program until March 31, 1995, or until an alternative program is developed that will achieve the same emission reductions. The Employer Trip Reduction Program or an alternative program shall not be required if the area classified as severe ozone nonattainment is reclassified as a serious ozone nonattainment area by the Environmental Protection Agency. (j) Program for repair of certain vehicles.-- The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to the Credit for Repairing Polluting Vehicles Program which the Department of Environmental Protection may establish. The program may provide that any person could make repairs to or reimburse expenses for repairs to registered motor vehicles which have been identified as polluting vehicles. Upon certification that the vehicle is no longer a polluting vehicle, the Department of Environmental Protection shall award the appropriate emission credit to the person applying for the credit in accordance with the applicable requirements of this title, the act of January 8, 1960 (1959 P.L.2119, No.787), known as the Air Pollution Control Act, and the Clean Air Act (69 Stat. 322, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.).

If a planned community is subject to the provisions of this paragraph, a declarant shall: (i) include provisions in any sales agreement for a unit of such planned community which states that an association exists or may be created to own and manage certain generally described common elements or limited common elements and that there may be imposed by the association assessments upon unit owners for expenses related to the ownership, management, administration or regulation of such elements; and (ii) prepare and record a declaration in the manner set forth in section 5205 (relating to contents of declaration; all planned communities) or 5206 (relating to contents of declaration for flexible planned communities) or covenants and restrictions as may be appropriate for the planned community. The declarant shall provide to the purchaser copies of the proposed or recorded declaration or covenants and restrictions, an actual or proposed budget of the planned community in accordance with the provisions of section 5402(a)(7) (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) and the actual or proposed bylaws of the association, provided that the purchaser has the right, before conveyance, to cancel the agreement within seven days of the date of receiving a copy of the proposed or recorded declaration or covenants and restrictions, the actual or proposed budget and the actual or proposed bylaws. As used in this paragraph, the term \"open space\" shall include an area of land or an area of water or a combination of land and water within a planned community intended for the use or enjoyment of residents, including, but not limited to, ball fields and courts, parks, walking, hiking or biking trails, wetlands, wooded areas and walkways and driveways providing access thereto or parking intended for users of such open space. The term does not include streets, utility lines or facilities or swimming pools or clubhouses owned or leased and maintained by the association. (b) Retroactivity.-- Except as provided in subsection (c), sections 5105, 5106, 5107, 5203 (relating to construction and validity of declaration and bylaws), 5204 (relating to description of units), 5218, 5219 (relating to amendment of declaration), 5223 (relating to merger or consolidation of planned community), 5302(a)(1) through (6) and (11) through (15) (relating to power of unit owners' association), 5311 (relating to tort and contract liability), 5315 (relating to lien for assessments), 5316 (relating to association records), 5407 (relating to resales of units) and 5412 (relating to effect of violations on rights of action) and section 5103 (relating to definitions), to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all planned communities created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart; but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subpart and do not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those planned communities. (b.1) Retroactivity.-- (1) Sections 5103, 5108, 5113, 5220(i) (relating to termination of planned community), 5222 (relating to master associations), 5302(a)(8)(i), (16) and (17) (relating to power of unit owners' association), 5303(a) and (b) (relating to executive board members and officers), 5307 (relating to upkeep of planned community), 5314 (relating to assessments for common expenses) and 5319 (relating to other liens affecting planned community), to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all planned communities created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those planned communities. (2) Section 5303(c) and (d), to the extent necessary in construing any of those subsections, apply to all planned communities created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those subsections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring 180 days after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those planned communities. (c) Nonflexible planned communities.-- If a planned community created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains no more than 12 units and is not a flexible planned community, it is subject only to sections 5105, 5106, 5107 and 5218 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that planned community. (d) Amendments to declarations, bylaws, plats and plans.-- (1) In the case of amendments to the declaration, bylaws and plats and plans of any planned community created before the effective date of this subpart: (i) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made under this subpart. (ii) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made under this subpart. (2) An amendment to the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the document being amended. If any such amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this subpart, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in this subpart also apply to that person. (e) Nonresidential units.-- This subpart does not apply to a planned community in which all units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use unless the declaration provides that the subpart does apply to that planned community. This subpart applies to a planned community containing both units which are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use and other units which are not so restricted only if the declaration so provides or if the real estate comprising the units which may be used for residential purposes would be a planned community in the absence of the units which may not be used for residential purposes. (f) Planned communities outside Commonwealth.-- This subpart does not apply to planned communities or units located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions under sections 5402 (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) through 5405 (relating to public offering statement; planned community securities) shall apply to all contracts for the disposition thereof signed in this Commonwealth by any purchaser unless exempt under section 5401(b)(2) (relating to applicability; waiver).

(a) General rule.-- In order to operate a limousine service within a city of the first class, the limousine service must have a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority under section 5741.1 (relating to power of authority). The authority may grant a certificate of public convenience to provide limousine service if the authority determines that the applicant is capable of providing safe, adequate, lawful and dependable service to the public. The authority may by regulation define categories of limousine service. The authority may separately grant certificates of public convenience for each category of limousine service and specify the rights associated with the certificates of public convenience by category of limousine service. (a.1) Advance reservation limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service within a city of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon advance reservation: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate issued; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as part of a continuous trip. (a.2) Other limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide nonexclusive, scheduled limousine service may transport persons and their baggage to or from any airport, railroad station or hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class without advance reservation in accordance with rules and regulations established by the authority. (a.3) Commission limousine certificate holders.-- A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service in a city of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the commission authorizing limousine service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and their baggage: (1) to a city of the first class upon advance reservation and in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (2) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond the city of the first class upon advance reservation in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience, excluding service from any airport, railroad station and hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class. (b) Enforcement.-- (1) The provisions of this subchapter and the rules and regulations promulgated by the authority pursuant to this subchapter shall be enforced within cities of the first class by authority personnel. (2) The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission may initiate actions before the authority. (c) Restrictions.-- (1) Certificates issued pursuant to this subchapter shall be nontransferable unless a transfer is approved by the authority. (2) A limousine service provider operating pursuant to an authority-issued certificate of public convenience and a filed tariff permitting the limousine service provider to charge mileage-based rates on the effective date of this paragraph shall be permitted to continue to charge mileage-based rates and to be regulated in the same manner as traditional limousine service providers. (d) Penalties involving certified limousines.-- Operating a certificated limousine in violation of this subchapter and authority regulations with regard to limousine service in a city of the first class or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745 (relating to civil penalties). (e) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a limousine or giving the appearance of offering limousine service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience, is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each subsequent offense. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as a limousine without a certificate of public convenience are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (f) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) In addition to penalties provided for in subsections (d) and (e), the authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles and equipment which are utilized to provide limousine service without a proper certificate of public convenience in a city of the first class or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and equipment and payment of the authority's costs associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction. (ii) To all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner and operator of the confiscated property. (iii) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the lien of any registered lienholder of the confiscated property upon demand. (iv) Except as provided in subparagraph (v), to the registered owner of the confiscated property upon demand. (v) When not claimed by any registered lienholder or registered owner within one year of the auction date, remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the fund. (f.1) Assessment.-- After application of the proceeds from the sale of confiscated property under subsection (f), the uncompensated costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction and all outstanding penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property may be assessed against the registered owner or operator of the confiscated property as the authority may prescribe by regulation.

(2) The lessee authorizes the lessor or its agent to commit any breach of the peace in repossessing the rental property or to enter the lessee's dwelling or other premises without obtaining the lessee's consent at the time of entry. (3) The lessor mandates that the lessee purchase insurance or liability waiver against loss or damage to the rental property from the lessor. This paragraph shall not, however, be construed to prohibit a lessor from offering insurance or a liability waiver to a lessee provided it is clearly disclosed that acceptance of the offer of insurance or a liability waiver is optional. (4) The lessee waives or agrees to waive any defense, counterclaim or right the lessee may have against the lessor, its agent or its successor in interest. (5) The lessee is required to pay a late fee unless the rental payment is five days or more late under a rental-purchase agreement with payments made monthly or two days or more late under a rental-purchase agreement with payments made more frequently than monthly.

(a) Applicability.-- The interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of the following shall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this section: (1) Life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year on or after the operative date of section 410A(e) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (2) Individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1981. (3) Annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1981, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts. (4) The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1981, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts. (b) Calendar year statutory valuation interest rates.-- The following shall apply: (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, I, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearest 0.25%: (i) For life insurance: I = .03 + W(R1 - .03) + W/2(R2 - .09). Where R1 is the lesser of R and .09, R2 is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this section and W is the weighting factor defined in this section. (ii) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: I = .03 + W(R1 - .03). Where R1 is the lesser of R and .09, R2 is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this section and W is the weighting factor defined in this section. (iii) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subparagraph (ii): (A) The formula for life insurance stated in subparagraph (i) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of 10 years. (B) The formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (ii) shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of 10 years or less. (iv) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (ii) shall apply. (v) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (ii) shall apply. (2) The following shall apply: (i) If the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for a life insurance policy issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this subparagraph differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than 0.5%, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. (ii) For purposes of applying subparagraph (i), the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980, using the reference interest rate defined in 1979, and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of the operative date of section 410A(e) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (c) Weighting factors.-- The weighting factors referred to in subsection (b) shall be as follows: (1) For life insurance, the guarantee duration shall be the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values, or both, which are guaranteed in the original policy. Weighting factors for life insurance shall be as provided in the following table: Guarantee Duration (Years) Weighting Factors 10 or less .50 More than 10, but not more than 20 .45 More than 20 .35 (2) Weighting factors for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options shall be .80. (3) Weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in paragraph (2), shall be as specified in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii), according to the rules and definitions in subparagraphs (iv), (v) and (vi): (i) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis, the following table shall apply: Guarantee Duration (Years) Weighting Factor for Plan Type A B C 5 or less .80 .60 .50 More than 5, but not more than 10 .75 .60 .50 More than 10, but not more than 20 .65 .50 .45 More than 20 .45 .35 .35 (ii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors shown in subparagraph (i) shall be increased by .15 for plan type A, .25 for plan type B and .05 for plan type C. (iii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis, other than those with no cash settlement options, that do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis that do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than 12 months beyond the valuation date, the factors shown in subparagraph (i) or derived in subparagraph (ii) shall be increased by .05 for plan types A, B and C. (iv) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence. (v) Each plan type referenced in this paragraph shall be defined as follows: (A) \"Plan type A.\" A plan in which at any time the policyholder may withdraw funds only: (I) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; (II) without an adjustment but in installments over five years or more; (III) as an immediate life annuity; or (IV) no withdrawal permitted. (B) \"Plan type B.\" A plan in which, before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, the policyholder may withdraw funds only: (I) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; (II) without an adjustment but in installments over five years or more; or (III) no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without an adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years. (C) \"Plan type C.\" A plan in which the policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either: (I) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company; or (II) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund. (vi) The following shall apply: (A) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. (B) Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options shall be valued on an issue year basis. (C) As used in this section: (I) An issue year basis of valuation shall refer to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract. (II) A change in fund basis of valuation shall refer to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund. (d) Reference interest rate.-- The reference interest rate referred to in subsection (b) shall be defined as follows: (1) For life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year preceding the year of issue, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (2) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (3) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in paragraph (2), with guarantee duration in excess of 10 years, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (4) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in paragraph (2), with guarantee duration of 10 years or less, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (5) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (6) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in paragraph (2), the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (e) Alternative method to determine reference interest rate.-- If the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or if NAIC determines that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate adopted by NAIC and approved by regulation may be substituted.

(a) Allocation.-- For eligible fiscal years up to and through the 1998-1999 fiscal year, 25% of the Commonwealth's total annual appropriation for the system of State aid established under section 9333 (relating to State system of aid to libraries), or a minimum of 25¢ per capita for each person residing in the municipalities of the libraries which qualify for basic aid, shall be allocated as basic aid. (b) Minimum financial effort.-- (1) Any local library which makes a minimum financial effort equal to one-half mill, for the municipalities on behalf of which it applies for aid, or $2 per capita for each person residing in those municipalities, whichever is less, and achieves the basic standards, shall qualify for basic State aid. The aid shall not be less than 25¢ for each person residing in the municipalities. (2) If the allocation for basic aid exceeds the amount necessary to pay the minimum rate, the entire allocation shall be distributed at a per capita rate which shall be determined by dividing the allocation by the number of persons in this Commonwealth on behalf of which local libraries and library systems apply and qualify for basic aid. In the first year in which a library applies for State aid, it shall qualify by making a minimum financial effort equal to one-quarter mill, or $1 per capita for each person residing in the municipalities, whichever is less. (c) Qualification.-- (1) In each of the succeeding five years, the library shall qualify for maximum State aid only when it increases its financial effort by the following scale of percentages of the difference between the financial effort with which the library initially qualified for State aid and a financial effort equal to one-half mill, or $2 per capita for each person residing in the municipalities for which it applies for aid, whichever is less: 1st succeeding year-20%; 2nd succeeding year-40%; 3rd succeeding year-60%; 4th succeeding year-80%; and 5th succeeding year-100%. (2) If the increase in any year is less than the percentage specified under paragraph (1), the amount of State aid shall be reduced by a percentage equal to one-fifth of the percentage which the difference between the required increase and the actual increase bears to the required increase multiplied by the number of years of participation in State aid beyond the first year. (d) Ineligibility.-- After the fifth succeeding year, a local library shall not be eligible for further State aid unless it makes a financial effort equal to one-half mill for the municipalities on behalf of which it applies for aid, or $2 per capita for each person residing in those municipalities, whichever is less.",

(a) Upgrading capability to use coal.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations which require utilities to uprate their electric power production by increasing the capability to use coal in existing coal-fueled plants where economically feasible and where the uprate is beneficial to ratepayers. (b) Incentive for uprating.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations which establish a special cost recovery and shared benefits procedure for electric utilities and their ratepayers as an incentive to implement upratings as provided in subsection (a). Nothing in this section shall permit or require the commission to establish rates or procedures which are inconsistent with any other section in this title. (c) Cost of upgrading.-- Notwithstanding section 1315 (relating to limitation on consideration of certain costs for electric utilities) and subject to regulations promulgated by the commission, the commission may allow a portion of the prudently incurred costs, determined on a per megawatt basis and not to exceed 50% of the unit's undepreciated original cost per megawatt, of uprating the capability of an existing coal-fueled plant to use coal mined in Pennsylvania to be made a part of the rate base or otherwise included in the rates charged by the utility before such uprating is completed.

(a) General rule.-- The commission shall provide for audits of any electric, gas, telephone or water utility whose plant in service is valued at not less than $10,000,000. The audits shall include an examination of management effectiveness and operating efficiency. The commission shall establish procedures for audits of the operations of utilities as provided in this section. Audits shall be conducted at least once every five years unless the commission finds that a specific audit is unnecessary, but in no event shall audits be conducted less than once every eight years. A summary of the audits mandated by this subsection shall be released to the public, and a complete copy of the audits shall be provided to the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate. (b) Management efficiency investigations.-- In addition to the audits mandated by subsection (a), the commission shall appoint a management efficiency investigator who shall periodically examine the management effectiveness and operating efficiency of all utilities required to be audited under subsection (a) and monitor the utility company responses to the audits required by subsection (a). For the purposes of carrying out the periodic audit required by this subsection and for carrying out the monitoring of audits required by subsection (a), the commission is hereby empowered to direct the management efficiency investigator to conduct such investigations through and with teams made up of commission staff and/or independent consulting firms; further, the commission may designate specific items of management effectiveness and operating efficiency to be investigated. The management efficiency investigator shall provide an annual report to the commission, the affected utility, the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate detailing the findings of such investigations. (c) Use of independent auditing firms.-- The commission may require an audit under subsection (a) or (b) to be performed by an independent consulting firm. When the commission, under either subsection (a) or (b), orders an audit to be performed by an independent consulting firm, the commission, after consultation with the utility, shall select the firm and require the utility to enter into a contract with the firm providing for payment of the firm by the utility. The terms of the contract shall include all reasonable expenses directly related to the performance of the audit or to the management efficiency investigation activities of independent consulting firms at the utility, as well as their preparation and presentation of testimony in any contested litigation which may be undertaken as a result of the audit findings under subsection (a) or (b).

(a) Eligibility.-- An operator who desires to receive an Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan shall submit a loan application to a lending institution. The application shall contain information demonstrating all of the following: (1) The applicant is an eligible borrower. (2) The best management practice for which the applicant is seeking a loan under this chapter has been approved by the commission or the commission's delegated agent for implementation. (3) Reasonable estimated costs for implementation of the approved best management practices sought to be funded have been provided by a project designer and concurred in by the commission or its delegated agent. (b) Implementation of program.-- The procedures applicable to the Agriculture-Linked Investment Program are as follows: (1) A lending institution wishing to participate in this program shall enter into an investment agreement with the Commonwealth. (2) A lending institution shall accept and review applications for loans from eligible borrowers. (3) A lending institution shall apply all usual lending standards, practices and forms to determine the creditworthiness of each eligible borrower. (4) Upon the lending institution's approval of an eligible borrower's loan application, the lending institution shall submit to the State Treasurer a request for the transfer of Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money in an amount equivalent to the amount of the loan approved, along with the application and any supporting documents filed in accordance with subsection (a). (5) The State Treasurer shall review the submitted request for the transfer of money and any supporting documentation for completeness prior to the transfer of Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money to the lending institution. (6) Upon determination of the completeness of the request for money and supporting documentation, the State Treasurer shall transfer to the lending institution money equivalent to the amount of the loan approved as follows: (i) if the lending institution is a State depository, the State Treasurer shall deposit the money in a collateralized certificate of deposit in the name of the Commonwealth which, except as provided in this chapter, conforms to the legal requirements for deposits in State depositories; or (ii) if the lending institution is an agricultural credit association affiliated with the Farm Credit Bank, the State Treasurer shall invest the money in bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities issued by the Farm Credit Bank. (7) The interest rate payable by lending institutions with respect to Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money shall be the interest rate on deposits in State depositories as established by the Board of Finance and Revenue from time to time, as otherwise provided by law, reduced by any subsidy that the commission may agree to pay under this chapter. (8) Principal balances of Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money with each lending institution shall be adjusted periodically as follows: (i) If the lending institution is a State depository, the principal amount of the certificate of deposit shall be adjusted not less than semiannually to reflect the reduction of the principal outstanding on the loan. The interest earned plus an amount equal to the principal repaid by the borrower shall be remitted not less than semiannually by the lending institution to the State Treasurer. (ii) If the lending institution is an agricultural credit association in conjunction with the Farm Credit Bank, the face value of the bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities outstanding shall, at the option of the State Treasurer, be periodically reduced by payment or redemption to match as nearly as possible the amount of principal outstanding on program loans, and the interest earned shall be payable to the State Treasurer as due in accordance with the terms of the bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities. (c) Terms of loan for borrowers.-- The terms of the loans for borrowers shall be: (1) Loans shall not exceed $250,000. (2) Loans shall be amortized over a term not to exceed 12 years. (3) The interest rate shall be established at or prior to the approval of the eligible borrower's loan application. (4) The interest rate charged by a lending institution to an eligible borrower shall reflect a percentage rate reduction below the prevailing market loan interest rate otherwise applicable to the borrower that is equal to the percentage rate reduction, if any, below the rate set by the Board of Finance and Revenue at which the certificates of deposit associated with the loan are placed or at which the investment in bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities of the Farm Credit Bank associated with the loan are made. (5) The interest rate charged by a lending institution to an eligible borrower may be either a fixed rate for the entire term of the loan or a variable rate which shall be adjusted semiannually to reflect changes in the interest rate established by the Board of Finance and Revenue for deposits in State depositories as otherwise provided by law. (6) Except as modified by the requirements of this chapter, a lending institution may apply its usual policies and practices with respect to the administration, collection and enforcement of loans issued under this chapter. (d) Interest subsidy.-- (1) The commission, at the commission's discretion, may enter into an agreement with the State Treasurer to subsidize the interest rate charged to eligible borrowers under this program with money provided to the commission under section 4(6) of the Conservation District Law or section 512 (relating to Nutrient Management Fund). (2) Under the agreement, the commission may designate from time to time a block of loans of a certain aggregate dollar amount which the commission wishes to subsidize and shall deposit in advance into a restricted escrow account in the State Treasury an amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be sufficient to make the yield over a 12-year term on the Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money to be transferred to lending institutions in connection with each designated block of subsidized loans equivalent to the yield the money otherwise would have earned at interest rates established from time to time by the Board of Finance and Revenue for deposits in State depositories as otherwise provided by law. Withdrawals from the restricted escrow account shall be made by the State Treasurer at the times when interest becomes due and payable from lending institutions on Agriculture-Linked Investment Loan money associated with subsidized loans. (3) Among its terms, the agreement shall contain provisions: (i) To require the deposit of additional money into the restricted escrow account when the parties agree that the account balance has become insufficient to fully fund the subsidy. (ii) To permit the withdrawal of money from the escrow account when the parties agree that the account balance exceeds the amount needed to fully fund the subsidy. (4) The amount to be deposited into the restricted escrow account as to each block of loans designated by the commission shall be determined by calculating that the loans will be amortized over 12 years at a fixed rate of interest which is a number of percentage points below the prevailing market interest rate for such loans, to be designated by the commission.",

(c) Knowledge of deceptive practice.-- In addition to any civil penalty imposed for violations of subsection (a) or (b), the department may assess a distributor, producer, refiner or retailer with an additional civil penalty equal to: (1) the difference between the price per gallon charged to the consumer for the automotive fuel in question and the price per gallon charged to the consumer for the lowest octane grade at the retail dispensing facility at the time of the violation; and (2) multiplied by the capacity of the storage tank from which the product in question was dispensed; if the distributor, producer, refiner or retailer violates any provisions of this subchapter with actual knowledge that the act or practice underlying the violation is unfair or deceptive. (d) Repeat violations.-- In addition to any civil penalty assessed in accordance with the provisions of this section, the department may initiate criminal proceedings for a second or subsequent violation of sections 4187.4 and 4187.5 (relating to automotive fuel rating, disclosure and labeling requirements).

The declaration may specify a smaller number only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use. (b) Limitation of action to challenge amendment.-- No action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted by the association pursuant to this section may be brought more than six months after the amendment is recorded. (c) Recording amendment.-- The following shall apply: (1) Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in every county in which any portion of the cooperative is located in the same records as are maintained for the recording of deeds of real property and is effective only upon recordation. In cases where the amendment is executed by the association, it shall be indexed in the name of the cooperative and the association in both the grantor and the grantee index.

(2) Except for counties which do not maintain a uniform parcel identifier number system of indexing, all counties shall assign a master parcel number to each cooperative, and every amendment to the declaration shall be indexed against the master parcel. If required by the county, an amendment may be indexed against a parcel assigned to each unit within the cooperative, but no fees shall be charged to each unit unless the indexing against each parcel is requested by the declarant or association.

(e) Officer authorized to execute amendment.-- Amendments to the declaration required by this subpart to be recorded by the association shall be prepared, executed, recorded and certified on behalf of the association by any officer of the association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of designation, by the president of the association. (f) Corrective amendments.-- Except as otherwise provided in the declaration, if any amendment to the declaration is necessary in the judgment of the executive board to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision of the declaration that is defective, missing or inconsistent with any other provision thereof or with this subpart or if an amendment is necessary in the judgment of the executive board to conform to the requirements of any agency or entity that has established national or regional standards with respect to loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on units in cooperative projects (such as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), to comply with any statute, regulation, code or ordinance which may now or hereafter be made applicable to the cooperative or association, or to make a reasonable accommodation or permit a reasonable modification in favor of handicapped, as may be defined by prevailing Federal or State laws or regulations applicable to the association, proprietary lessees, residents or employees, then, at any time and from time to time, the executive board may at its discretion effect an appropriate corrective amendment without the approval of the proprietary lessees or the holders of any liens on all or any part of the cooperative, upon receipt by the executive board of an opinion from legal counsel who is independent from the declarant to the effect that the proposed amendment is permitted by the terms of this subsection.

(a) General rule.-- If the declaration provides that any of the powers described in section 4302 (relating to powers of association) are to be exercised by or may be delegated to a profit or nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association (a \"master association\") which exercises those or other powers on behalf of one or more cooperatives, condominiums, homeowners associations or any combination of the foregoing or for the benefit of the proprietary lessees of one or more cooperatives, unit owners of one or more condominiums, members of one or more homeowners associations or some combination of the foregoing, all provisions of this subpart applicable to associations apply to any such corporation or unincorporated association insofar as such association is acting on behalf of one or more cooperatives, except as modified by this section. (b) Exercise of powers of association.-- Unless a master association is acting in the capacity of an association described in section 4301 (relating to organization of association), it may exercise the powers set forth in section 4302 only to the extent expressly permitted in the declarations of the cooperatives which are part of the master association or expressly described in the delegations of power from those cooperatives to the master association. (c) Liability for exercise of delegated powers.-- If the declaration of any cooperative provides that the executive board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board have no liability for the acts of omissions of the master association with respect to those powers following delegation. The officers and members of the governing board of the master association are subject to liability to the cooperative association whose powers are delegated thereto and the proprietary lessees of such cooperative on the same basis as officers and executive board members of such cooperative immediately before such delegation of power. (d) Rights and liabilities of proprietary lessees.-- The rights and responsibilities of proprietary lessees with respect to the association set forth in sections 4303 (relating to executive board members and officers), 4308 (relating to meetings), 4309 (relating to quorums), 4310 (relating to voting; proxies), 4312 (relating to conveyance or encumbrance of cooperative) and 4320 (relating to declarant delivery of items to association) apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association only to those persons who elect the board of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise proprietary lessees within the meaning of this subpart. (e) Election of executive board.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4303(f) with respect to the election of the executive board of an association by all proprietary lessees after the period of declarant control ends and even if a master association is also an association described in section 4301, the certificate of incorporation or other instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each cooperative, the powers of which are assigned by the declaration or delegated to the master association, may provide that the executive board of the master association must be elected after the period of declarant control in any of the following ways: (1) All proprietary lessees of all cooperatives subject to the master association may elect all members of that executive board. (2) All members of the executive boards of all cooperatives subject to the master association may elect all members of that executive board. (3) All proprietary lessees of each cooperative subject to the master association may elect specified members of the executive board. (4) All members of the executive boards of each cooperative subject to the master association may elect specified members of that executive board. (e.1) Independent reviewer.-- The certificate of incorporation or other instrument creating the master association and the declaration of each cooperative, the powers of which are assigned by the declaration or delegated to the master association, shall provide that a vote by a proprietary lessee in an election of the executive board of an association must be submitted by the proprietary lessee to an independent reviewer who shall tally the results of the election and certify the results to the executive board and proprietary lessees. In order to be eligible to vote in the election, a proprietary lessee shall be in good standing with the master association. The executive board shall present the official election results based on the certified election report from the independent reviewer at a meeting of the proprietary lessees and shall enter the results in the meeting records. All votes by proprietary lessees under this subsection shall be submitted to the independent reviewer in accordance with the approved methods of voting as provided under this subpart. This subsection shall only apply to a cooperative with at least 500 units. If a cooperative has less than 500 units, the master association may opt in to the requirements under this subsection by a vote of at least 51% of the votes collected from the unit owners in person, electronically or by absentee ballot which are in favor of the requirements under this subsection. (f) When section applicable to cooperative.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to a cooperative if and when: (1) there occurs either a date specified in the declaration or any amendment thereto from and after which this section shall apply to the cooperative; (2) there occurs an event or action that the declaration or any amendment thereto states shall cause this section to become applicable, and the association causes to be recorded an instrument duly executed by the president of the association stating that: (i) such event or action has occurred and the date of such occurrence, thereby causing this section to become applicable to the cooperative; and (ii) that a copy of such instrument has been sent to all proprietary lessees; or (3) the declarant executes and records an instrument stating that this section shall thereafter apply to the cooperative and that a copy of the instrument has been sent to the executive board and all proprietary lessees. Paragraph (3) shall be applicable only if the declarant expressly reserved in the declaration, pursuant to section 4205(a)(8) (relating to contents of declaration), the special declarant right to make this section applicable to the cooperative and only if the instrument exercising such right is recorded during the time period allowed for the exercise of such right. (g) When executive board not required.-- If all of the powers of a cooperative association are delegated to a master association and accepted by the master association pursuant to this section, then the governing body of the master association may act in all respects as the executive board of the cooperative and no separate executive board need be elected or exist.

(b) Execution and recording of agreement.-- The merger or consolidation of two or more cooperatives pursuant to subsection (a) must be evidenced by a recorded agreement duly executed by the president of the association of each of the preexisting cooperatives following approval by proprietary lessees of cooperative interests to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each cooperative required to terminate that cooperative. Any such agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the cooperative is located and is not effective until so recorded.

Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection. (2) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien. (3) The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected. (b) Time of perfection: proceeds and supporting obligations.-- For the purposes of subsection (a)(1): (1) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and (2) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation. (c) Special priority rules: proceeds and supporting obligations.-- Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a security interest in collateral which qualifies for priority over a conflicting security interest under section 9327 (relating to priority of security interests in deposit account), 9328 (relating to priority of security interests in investment property), 9329 (relating to priority of security interests in letter-of-credit right), 9330 (relating to priority of purchaser of chattel paper or instrument) or 9331 (relating to priority of rights of purchasers of controllable accounts, controllable electronic records, controllable payment intangibles, documents, instruments and securities under other divisions; priority of interests in financial assets and security entitlements and protection against assertion of claim under Divisions 8 and 12) also has priority over a conflicting security interest in all of the following: (1) Any supporting obligation for the collateral. (2) Proceeds of the collateral if: (i) the security interest in proceeds is perfected; (ii) the proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and (iii) in the case of proceeds which are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are: (A) cash proceeds; (B) proceeds of the same type as the collateral; or (C) an account relating to the collateral.

(a) Regular financial effort required.-- To qualify for incentive for excellence aid, a local library or library system shall make a financial effort greater than $5 per capita for each person residing in the municipalities that will be part of the direct service area in which the library is applying for aid. (b) Standards.-- To receive aid under this section, a local library or library system shall meet the following minimum standards: (1) The local library or library system shall qualify for quality libraries aid under section 9334 (relating to quality libraries aid). (2) The local library or library system shall annually spend not less than 12% of its operating budget on collections, excluding costs of an unusual, emergency or nonrecurring nature. A local library or library system that spends more than 12% in the year in which it qualified for incentive for excellence aid shall increase the total amount spent on collections each succeeding year by the lesser of: (i) five percent of its operating budget; or (ii) the percentage increase in the appropriation for improvement of library services. (3) Unless the State Librarian promulgates rules and regulations after the effective date of this section that require different hours of operation, the local library or a member library within a library system shall be open for full services for the following minimum number of hours: (i) At least 45 hours per week during those times best suited to the needs of residents of its service area, including at least seven hours during the weekend period beginning on Saturday and ending on Sunday. (ii) Weekend hours may be reduced to four hours during time periods as community-use patterns warrant, for a maximum of ten weeks per year. (iii) A local library or member library within a library system may reduce total weekly hours by three hours per week during the ten-week period of reduced Saturday and Sunday hours if approved by the State Librarian. (4) The local library or member library within a library system shall require at least six hours of continuing education every two years for paid staff working at least 20 hours per week in direct support of the library service. (c) Allocation method.-- The annual allocation of funds available for incentive for excellence aid shall be allocated proportionately to qualifying local libraries or library systems as follows: (1) Tier 1 funding, which is up to 80¢ for each $1 per capita or portion thereof of surplus financial effort that a local library or library system shows that exceeds 100%, but does not exceed 150%, of the minimum financial effort required to receive quality libraries aid. (2) Tier 2 funding, which is up to 10¢ for each $1 per capita or portion thereof of surplus financial effort that a local library or library system shows that exceeds 150%, but does not exceed 300%, of the minimum financial effort required to receive quality libraries aid. Eligibility for Tier 2 funding does not preclude receipt of Tier 1 funding. (d) Offsets prohibited.-- The following shall apply: (1) Unless the State Librarian accepts evidence of substantial curtailment of financial ability of the community, a local library or library system may not use incentive for excellence aid to reduce its financial effort for normal and recurring operating costs. (2) A plan for the use of incentive for excellence aid by a local library or library system may not be approved if the plan projects a decrease in local government support for normal and recurring operating costs from a previous level unless the State Librarian determines that the decrease is: (i) directly attributable to a gift or endowment to a local library; or (ii) there is a substantial decrease in the financial ability of the municipality on behalf of which the library or library system applied for aid.

(b) Minimum financial effort.-- (1) Any local library which makes a minimum financial effort equal to one-half mill, for the municipalities on behalf of which it applies for aid, or $2 per capita for each person residing in those municipalities, whichever is less, and achieves the basic standards, shall qualify for basic State aid. The aid shall not be less than 25¢ for each person residing in the municipalities. (2) If the allocation for basic aid exceeds the amount necessary to pay the minimum rate, the entire allocation shall be distributed at a per capita rate which shall be determined by dividing the allocation by the number of persons in this Commonwealth on behalf of which local libraries and library systems apply and qualify for basic aid. In the first year in which a library applies for State aid, it shall qualify by making a minimum financial effort equal to one-quarter mill, or $1 per capita for each person residing in the municipalities, whichever is less. (c) Qualification.-- (1) In each of the succeeding five years, the library shall qualify for maximum State aid only when it increases its financial effort by the following scale of percentages of the difference between the financial effort with which the library initially qualified for State aid and a financial effort equal to one-half mill, or $2 per capita for each person residing in the municipalities for which it applies for aid, whichever is less: 1st succeeding year-20%; 2nd succeeding year-40%; 3rd succeeding year-60%; 4th succeeding year-80%; and 5th succeeding year-100%. (2) If the increase in any year is less than the percentage specified under paragraph (1), the amount of State aid shall be reduced by a percentage equal to one-fifth of the percentage which the difference between the required increase and the actual increase bears to the required increase multiplied by the number of years of participation in State aid beyond the first year. (d) Ineligibility.-- After the fifth succeeding year, a local library shall not be eligible for further State aid unless it makes a financial effort equal to one-half mill for the municipalities on behalf of which it applies for aid, or $2 per capita for each person residing in those municipalities, whichever is less.",
