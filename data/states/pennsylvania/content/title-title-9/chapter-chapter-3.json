The directors of such corporation shall cause accurate accounts to be kept of such trust funds separate and apart from the other funds of the corporation. Any such corporation may combine and merge the principal of two or more such trust funds and any funds so set aside in an omnibus fund for the purposes of investment of the same.\n\n(b) Transfers to institutional fiduciary.--Any incorporated cemetery company may, by appropriate action of its stockholders or members and board of directors and with the approval of the court of common pleas of the county in which the cemetery, or any part thereof, is situated, transfer any of such funds to one or more institutional trustees, and with like investment restrictions, such transfer to be either revocable, or absolute and irrevocable, and upon the transfer of any such funds, the incorporated cemetery company and its directors shall be relieved of all liability for the investment and reinvestment thereof.\n\nCross References.Section 309 is referred to in sections 101, 308 of this title.",
