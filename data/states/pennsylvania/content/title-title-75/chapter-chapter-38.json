Under such circumstances, parole or reparole of the offender shall be at the parole authority's discretion.\n\n(e) Follow-up.--After an offender has completed the treatment program under subsection (c), the parole officer shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the offender does not abuse alcohol, use illegal controlled substances or abuse prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs or any other such substances.
