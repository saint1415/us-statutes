(a) General rule.-- When any certificate of title has been issued in error to a person not entitled to the certificate or contains incorrect information or information has been omitted from the certificate, the department shall notify in writing the person to whom the certificate has been issued or delivered that the certificate has been recalled. Unless a departmental hearing is requested pursuant to subsection (a.1), such person shall immediately return the certificate of title within ten days, together with any other information necessary for the adjustment of departmental records, and, upon receipt of the certificate, the department shall cancel the certificate and issue a corrected certificate of title. (a.1) Opportunity for hearing and appeal.-- The department's notice of recall shall advise the person to whom the certificate has been issued that said person may request an informal departmental hearing within ten days of the date of said notice if said person wishes to contest the recall. If an informal departmental hearing is requested within ten days, said hearing shall be held within 15 days of said request. If, as a result of the hearing, the department determines that the recall was proper, the person to whom the certificate of title was issued or delivered shall return the certificate of title within ten days of the determination. Such person may appeal the informal departmental determination by requesting, within ten days of the date of the determination, a formal hearing as prescribed by departmental regulations (pertaining to administrative practice and procedure). (b) Change in material information on certificate.-- If any material information on the certificate of title is changed or different from the information originally set forth, the owner shall immediately inform the department and apply for a corrected certificate of title. For the purposes of this subsection, a change of address shall not be deemed material. (b.1) Change in name on certificate.-- Whenever there is a change of name because of marriage or divorce, the owner shall not be required to apply for a corrected certificate of title but shall, in such manner as the department shall prescribe, inform the department of the new name and of the title number of every vehicle titled in the owner's former name. Upon receipt of such information, the department shall correct the vehicle record of the owner to indicate the name change. The department shall not be required to produce a new certificate of title for a name change because of marriage or divorce, unless the owner submits an application for a new certificate of title. In the event that the owner submits an application for a new certificate of title, such owner shall be required to remit the fee set forth in section 1952 (relating to certificate of title) for the issuance of a certificate of title by the department. (c) Seizure of certificate on conviction.-- (Deleted by amendment). (d) Issuance of corrected certificate after seizure or cancellation.-- Upon failure of a person to return a certificate of title as required by the provisions of this section, the department may delegate authority to any department employee or police officer to seize the certificate of title. Upon failure of the department to receive, as required by this section, the certificate of title to which a person is not entitled or which contains incorrect or omitted information, the department may proceed to cancel the certificate of title issued in error and, upon receipt of sufficient evidence that the vehicle is within the possession of the proper owner or lienholder, may issue to the proper owner or lienholder a correct certificate of title. (e) Penalty.-- Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $300.

(e) Disqualification for controlled substance offenses.-- The department shall disqualify any person from driving a commercial motor vehicle for life who is convicted of using a motor vehicle in the commission of any felony involving the manufacture, distribution or dispensing of a controlled substance or possession with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled substance where either: (1) the person was a commercial driver's license holder at the time of the commission of the felony; or (2) the motor vehicle used in the commission of the felony was a commercial motor vehicle.

A conviction for negligent homicide shall be treated as similar to either a conviction for violating 18 Pa.C.S. § 2504 or a conviction for violating section 3732 for purposes of the provisions of this section. (i) Surrender of license.-- Upon the disqualification of the commercial driving privilege or school vehicle driving privilege of a person, the license shall be surrendered as provided in section 1540 (relating to surrender of license). If the person is not a CDL holder, then the person shall submit an acknowledgment of disqualification to the department in lieu of the license. (j) Updating driving record.-- After disqualifying, suspending, revoking, recalling or canceling a commercial driving privilege, the department shall update its records to reflect that action. After disqualifying, suspending, revoking, recalling or canceling a commercial driving privilege issued by another state, the department shall notify the licensing authority of the state which issued the commercial driver's license or nonresident commercial driver's license. In addition to any other records required or authorized to be kept by the department, the department shall file or make suitable notation in its records thereof all reports of the conviction of any violation, in any motor vehicle, of a State or local traffic control law, except a parking violation, and also for any other report of conviction or report of test refusal that results in disqualification pursuant to this chapter, of a person who was a commercial driver at the time of the violation that are received by the department from any court or administrative body of the Commonwealth, another state or the Federal Government. Such reports or suitable notations may be stored and admitted into evidence by the department as provided in section 1516(b) (relating to department records). Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no record maintained by the department in accordance with the provisions of this subsection may be expunged by order of court. (k) Disqualification for railroad crossing offenses.-- The department shall disqualify any person from driving a commercial motor vehicle upon receiving a report of the person's conviction for an offense under section 3341 (relating to obedience to signal indicating approach of train), 3342 (relating to vehicles required to stop at railroad crossings) or 3343(a), (c) or (d) (relating to moving heavy equipment at railroad grade crossings) committed in a commercial vehicle as follows: (1) 60 days for a first conviction. (2) 120 days for a second conviction arising from separate and distinct incidents occurring within a three-year period. (3) One year for a third conviction arising from separate and distinct incidents occurring within a three-year period. (l) Disqualification for incomplete, incorrect or fraudulent application or certification.-- The department shall disqualify any person from driving a commercial motor vehicle for 60 days upon canceling the person's commercial driver's license pursuant to section 1572(a)(1)(ii) (relating to cancellation of driver's license) involving an application or certification related to the requirements of this chapter. (m) Limitation on noncommercial motor vehicle-based disqualifications.-- A violation which occurred prior to the effective date of this subsection and which did not involve a commercial motor vehicle shall not be considered by the department for purposes of applying a disqualification pursuant to this section. (n) Consecutive application.-- All disqualifications shall be imposed consecutively. (o) Fraud disqualification.-- The department shall disqualify an individual from driving a commercial motor vehicle for one year upon receiving a certified record of the driver's conviction of fraud relating to the issuance of a commercial driver learner's permit or commercial driver's license, and the commercial driver's license designation shall be removed from the driver's license. Unless otherwise ineligible, a driver may apply for a commercial driver learner's permit upon restoration of the operating privilege. (p) Retest disqualification.-- The department shall disqualify an individual from driving a commercial motor vehicle if the individual fails to take and pass a retest required under section 1607(a)(8) (relating to commercial driver's license qualification standards). A driver disqualified under section 1607(a)(8) must reapply for a commercial driver learner's permit under the procedures applicable to all commercial driver learner's permit applicants. (q) Human trafficking.-- The department shall disqualify an individual from operating a commercial motor vehicle for life upon receiving a record of conviction of using a commercial motor vehicle in commission of a felony involving an act or practice of a severe form of trafficking in persons, as defined under section 103 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464).

      "heading": "Restrictions on use of highways and bridges.",
      "text": "§ 4902. Restrictions on use of highways and bridges. (a) Restrictions based on condition of highway or bridge.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge only when they determine by conducting an engineering and traffic study as provided for in department regulations that the highway or bridge may be damaged or destroyed unless use by vehicles is prohibited or the permissible size or weight of vehicles is reduced. (2) School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (2.1) Government-owned vehicles, vehicles of local government agency contractors providing material for maintenance and department contractors engaged in or providing material for construction or maintenance shall be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways, except bridges, imposed under this subsection in accordance with department regulations. The following types of documents shall constitute evidence that a vehicle is traveling to or from a site in accordance with this paragraph: (i) A bill of lading. (ii) A shipping order. (iii) A service order or other document that indicates the address of the site and purpose of the trip. (3) The department may issue a statement of policy, which shall take effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, adopting an appropriate methodology to provide letters of local determination that identify particular vehicles, routes or uses as local in nature. (4) The methodology under paragraph (3) may allow for exemptions from 67 Pa. Code Ch. 189 (relating to hauling in excess of posted weight limit) related to the at-risk industry of logging or other forest products experiencing a 20% decline in Statewide employment between March 2002 and March 2011, as determined by the Department of Labor and Industry. (5) The exemptions and related requirements under paragraph (4) may remain in existence only until December 31, 2028. Exemptions for local delivery or pickup may not include traffic going to or coming from a site at which minerals, natural gas or natural resources are developed, harvested or extracted, notwithstanding whether the site is located at a residence, a commercial site or on farmland. Delivery or pickup of logs or other forest products to or from permanent processing mills located on or reachable only through posted highways shall be considered local delivery or pickup. Delivery or pickup of coal to or from permanent coal reprocessing or preparation plants located on or reachable only through posted highways and not on the same posted highway as a site at which coal is extracted shall be considered local delivery or pickup. (b) Restrictions based on traffic conditions.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge whenever they determine that hazardous traffic conditions or other safety factors require such a prohibition or restriction. School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (c) Permits and security.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities may issue permits for movement of vehicles of size and weight in excess of restrictions promulgated under subsections (a) and (b) with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdiction and may require such agreement or security as they deem necessary to cover the cost of repairs and restoration necessitated by the permitted movement of vehicles. In reference to subsection (a), the Commonwealth and local authorities shall not refuse to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction if there is no reasonable alternate route available. For purposes of this section, \"reasonable alternate route\" shall mean a route meeting the criteria set forth in department regulations relating to traffic and engineering studies. (2) The department may establish the types of permits to be issued and agreements to be entered into, subject to the following: (i) Permits may be for long-term or short-term use of the posted highways. (ii) The department may require multiple vehicles traveling to or from a single destination to operate pursuant to a single permit. (iii) The department may establish a permit type allowing the posting authority to determine that damage to the posted highway covered by the permit will be minimal. This type of permit may include categories based on the number and kinds of loads expected, including a category providing that use of the posted highway under a single minimum-use permit of less than 700 loads per year shall not require an agreement or security. The department may alter the 700 loads per year minimum-use threshold if it determines the structural capacity of the State highways can accept a higher or lower amount of over-posted weight traffic. The department may express the threshold as a loads-per-day, loads-per-week or loads-per-month number. (iv) The department may restrict use of de minimis and minimum-use permits during thaw periods as determined by the department. (v) The department shall exclude hauling related to unconventional oil and gas development from minimum-use status based on its disproportionate and qualitatively different impact upon highways and bridges. (3) The department shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. During the two years immediately following the effective date of this section, the department may promulgate temporary regulations, which shall expire no later than three years following the effective date of this paragraph or upon promulgation of final regulations, whichever occurs first. Temporary regulations promulgated by the department under this paragraph shall not be subject to any of the following: (i) Sections 201, 202 and 203 of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law. (ii) The Act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as the Regulatory Review Act. (d) Designation of alternate routes.-- (1) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsections (a) and (b), the Commonwealth may designate alternate routes for vehicles in excess of specified weights or sizes. Such alternate routes may utilize portions of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. (2) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsection (c), when refusing to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an alternate route study. The elements of an engineering and traffic study conducted to designate an alternate route pursuant to this section shall consist of the same elements found in department regulations. (e) Erection of signs.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities shall erect or cause to be erected and maintained restriction signs designating the restrictions within 25 feet of each end of a bridge or portion of highway restricted as provided in subsection (a) or (b). In the case of a restriction on a bridge or on a highway which does not begin or end at an intersection with an unrestricted highway, the Commonwealth or local authorities shall also place an advance informational sign at the intersection nearest each end of the restricted bridge or portion of highway which would allow drivers to avoid the restricted bridge or portion of highway. No person shall be convicted of violating subsection (a) or (b) unless the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the direction the person was driving was posted as required in this subsection. However, failure to post the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the opposite direction or failure to post any advance informational sign shall not constitute a defense to a violation of this section. (f) Actions to be in accordance with department regulations.-- All actions taken under authority of this section shall be taken in accordance with department regulations. (f.1) Local ordinances superseded.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, local authorities are prohibited from enacting or enforcing ordinances inconsistent with the provisions contained in this section. (g) Penalty.-- (1) Any person operating a vehicle or combination upon a highway or bridge in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (a) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $75, except that any person convicted of operating a vehicle with a gross weight in excess of a posted weight shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $150 plus $150 for each 500 pounds, or part thereof, in excess of 3,000 pounds over the maximum allowable weight. (2) Any person operating a vehicle or combination in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (b) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $500. (h) (Reserved). (i) Authority to conduct investigations and audits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an investigation and audit of a person or entity to determine if there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement. Audits shall be limited to proper usage of letters of local determination and de minimis and minimum-use permits. (j) Authority to suspend, revoke or deny permits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may suspend, revoke or deny a permit and agreement if it is determined by the Commonwealth or a local authority that there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

(a) Outside business and residence districts.-- Whenever any police officer finds a vehicle in violation of any of the provisions of section 3351 (relating to stopping, standing and parking outside business and residence districts), the officer may move the vehicle, or cause the vehicle to be moved, or require the driver or other person in charge of the vehicle to move the vehicle, to a position off the roadway where the vehicle will not interfere unduly with the normal movement of traffic or constitute a safety hazard. (b) Unattended vehicle obstructing traffic.-- Any police officer may remove or cause to be removed to a place of safety any unattended vehicle illegally left standing upon any highway, bridge, causeway or in any tunnel, in such position or under such circumstances as to interfere unduly with the normal movement of traffic or constitute a safety hazard. (c) Removal to garage or place of safety.-- Any police officer may remove or cause to be removed to the place of business of the operator of a wrecker or to a nearby garage or other place of safety any vehicle found upon a highway under any of the following circumstances: (1) Report has been made that the vehicle has been stolen or taken without the consent of its owner. (2) The person or persons in charge of the vehicle are physically unable to provide for the custody or removal of the vehicle. (3) The person driving or in control of the vehicle is arrested for an alleged offense for which the officer is required by law to take the person arrested before an issuing authority without unnecessary delay. (4) The vehicle is in violation of section 3353 (relating to prohibitions in specified places) except for overtime parking. (5) The vehicle has been abandoned as defined in this title. The officer shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 73 (relating to abandoned vehicles and cargos). (d) Notice to owner prior to removal.-- (1) Prior to removal of an abandoned vehicle bearing a registration plate, current certificate of inspection or vehicle identification number plate by which the last registered owner of the vehicle can be determined, the police department shall send a notice by certified mail to the last registered owner of the vehicle informing the owner that unless the vehicle is moved to a suitable location within seven days of the date notice is mailed, the vehicle will be removed under this section and held at a suitable facility where it may be reclaimed by the owner in accordance with the provisions of section 7306 (relating to payment of costs upon reclaiming vehicle). If the abandoned motor vehicle does not bear an identifiable registration plate, current certificate of inspection or vehicle identification number plate, the notice may be secured to the vehicle. (2) If, within the seven-day period, the owner so requests, the owner shall be given an opportunity to explain to the police officer or department why the owner believes the vehicle should not be removed. If the police officer or department determines that the vehicle shall, nonetheless, be removed, the owner shall be given an additional 48 hours to remove the vehicle, have it removed or demand a hearing, which shall conform to the requirements of 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 Subch. B (relating to practice and procedure of local agencies). The police officer or department shall inform the owner of the right to a hearing by delivering to the owner a notice warning the owner that, unless the vehicle is removed or a hearing is demanded, the owner shall be subject to the provisions of section 7306. If, as a result of the hearing, it is determined that the vehicle will be removed, the owner shall be given an additional 48 hours to remove the vehicle or have it removed. The hearing shall be before a civilian officer or employee of the municipality in which the vehicle is located. (3) The provision for notice set forth in this subsection is applicable only if the vehicle is abandoned upon a highway and is not in violation of subsection (b) or section 3351(a) or 3353. Notice under this subsection is in addition to any other notice requirements provided in Chapter 73. (4) This subsection does not apply to nonrepairable vehicles.

(a) General rule.-- Except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic or to protect the safety of any person or vehicle or in compliance with law or the directions of a police officer or official traffic-control device, no person shall: (1) Stop, stand or park a vehicle: (i) On the roadway side of any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge or curb of a street except that: (A) A pedalcycle may be parked as provided in section 3509(b)(2) (relating to parking). (B) Standing or parking for the purpose of loading or unloading persons or property may be authorized by local ordinance, but the ordinance shall not authorize standing or parking on State designated highways except during off-peak traffic-flow hours as determined by department regulations. (ii) On a sidewalk except that a pedalcycle may be parked as provided in section 3509(b)(2). (iii) Within an intersection. (iv) On a crosswalk. (v) Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb within 30 feet of points on the curb immediately opposite the ends of a safety zone, unless a different length is indicated by official traffic-control devices.

(vii) Upon any bridge or other elevated structure upon a highway or within a highway tunnel. (viii) On any railroad tracks. (ix) In the area between roadways of a divided highway, including crossovers. (x) At any place where official signs prohibit stopping. (2) Stand or park a vehicle: (i) In front of a public or private driveway. (ii) Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant. (iii) Within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection. (iv) Within 30 feet upon the approach to any flashing signal, stop sign, yield sign or traffic-control signal located at the site of a roadway. (v) Within 20 feet of the driveway entrance to any fire station or, when properly sign posted, on the side of a street opposite the entrance to any fire station within 75 feet of the entrance. (vi) Where the vehicle would prevent the free movement of a streetcar. (vii) On a limited access highway unless authorized by official traffic-control devices. (viii) At any place where official signs prohibit standing. (ix) Within 30 feet upon the approach to a sign warning of the possible presence of a person with a disability in the vicinity of a roadway adjacent to the person's residence or the possible presence of a person with a disability frequently traversing the roadway at that location. This subparagraph shall not apply unless an enabling local ordinance has been passed. The ordinance may apply generally throughout the municipality or be site specific. The ordinance may specify the height of vehicles prohibited from parking in these locations. The enforcement of this subparagraph requires that a sign indicating the violation and amount of fine be posted at each applicable location. For purposes of this section, the term \"disability\" shall mean a hearing impairment or total or partial blindness. (3) Park a vehicle: (i) Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing. (ii) At any place where official signs prohibit parking. (b) Unattended vehicle on private property.-- (1) No person shall park or leave unattended a vehicle on private property without the consent of the owner or other person in control or possession of the property except in the case of emergency or disablement of the vehicle, in which case the operator shall arrange for the removal of the vehicle as soon as possible. (2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to private parking lots unless such lots are posted to notify the public of any parking restrictions and the operator of the vehicle violates such posted restrictions. For the purposes of this section \"private parking lot\" means a parking lot open to the public or used for parking without charge; or a parking lot used for parking with charge. The department shall define by regulation what constitutes adequate posting for public notice. (c) Property owner may remove vehicle.-- The owner or other person in charge or possession of any property on which a vehicle is parked or left unattended in violation of the provisions of subsection (b) may remove or have removed the vehicle at the reasonable expense of the owner of the vehicle. Such person who removes or has removed a vehicle left parked or unattended in violation of the provisions of subsection (b) shall have a lien against the owner of the vehicle, in the amount of the reasonable value of the costs of removing the vehicle plus the costs of storage. Any city, borough, incorporated town or township may, by ordinance, provide for rates to be charged for removal of vehicles and for municipal regulation of authorized towing services. If storage charges are not set by the municipality, a maximum of $25 per day may be charged for storage.

(b) Application for certificate of salvage.-- An owner who transfers a vehicle to be destroyed or dismantled, salvaged or recycled shall assign the certificate of title to the person to whom the vehicle is transferred. Except as provided in section 1163, the transferee shall immediately present the assigned certificate of title to the department or an authorized agent of the department with an application for a certificate of salvage upon a form furnished and prescribed by the department. An insurer as defined in section 1702 to which title to a vehicle is assigned upon payment to the insured or claimant of the replacement value of a vehicle shall be regarded as a transferee under this subsection, and an assignment of title to an insurer under this subsection is exempt from the requirements of notarization and verification in section 1111(a) (relating to transfer of ownership of vehicle). If an owner retains possession of a vehicle which is damaged to the extent that it qualifies for vehicle replacement payment, the owner shall apply for a certificate of salvage immediately. In this case, an insurer shall not pay vehicle replacement value until the owner produces evidence to the insurer that the certificate of salvage has been issued. A self-insurer as defined in section 1702 shall apply for a certificate of salvage when a vehicle is damaged to the extent that the cost of repairs would exceed the replacement value of the vehicle as certified by a licensed motor vehicle physical damage appraiser. (c) Issuance and effect of certificate of salvage.-- Upon proper application for a certificate of salvage, the department or agent of the department shall issue to the transferee a certificate of salvage which shall authorize the holder to possess or by endorsement transfer ownership of the salvage vehicle. A certificate of title or registration shall not again be issued or renewed for the vehicle except upon application containing the information the department requires, accompanied by any necessary documents required under section 1165 (relating to reconstructed vehicles). (d) Out-of-State salvage vehicles.-- The owner of a salvage vehicle possessing a valid certificate of title or certificate of salvage from a state or jurisdiction other than this Commonwealth does not need to apply for a certificate under subsection (a). If the owner wishes to transfer the salvage vehicle, the owner shall make application to the department and attach the out-of-State certificate of title or certificate of salvage along with any other information and documents the department reasonably requires to establish the ownership of the vehicle and the existence or nonexistence of security interests in the vehicle. The person identified on the application must be located or the owner or lienholder must be domiciled in this Commonwealth to qualify for issuance of a certificate of salvage by the department. (e) Certificate not to be assigned in blank.-- No person shall make application for or assign or physically possess a certificate of salvage or direct or allow another person in his employ or control to make application for or assign or physically possess a certificate of salvage unless the name and address of the transferee is placed on the assignment of the certificate of salvage simultaneously with the name of the transferor. (f) Repairs to personal vehicle.-- Nothing herein shall require a vehicle owner to obtain a certificate of salvage to repair or replace parts or component parts which malfunction or wear out as a result of normal use and operation which has occurred after the vehicle was transferred to the owner.

The order may only be made upon motion for good cause shown.

(b) Report of examination.-- If requested by the person examined, a party causing an examination to be made shall promptly deliver to the person examined a copy of every written report concerning the examination at least one of which must set forth the physician's findings and conclusions in detail.

(a) General rule.-- A person or institution providing treatment, accommodations, products or services to an injured person for an injury covered by liability or uninsured and underinsured benefits or first party medical benefits, including extraordinary medical benefits, for a motor vehicle described in Subchapter B (relating to motor vehicle liability insurance first party benefits) shall not require, request or accept payment for the treatment, accommodations, products or services in excess of 110% of the prevailing charge at the 75th percentile; 110% of the applicable fee schedule, the recommended fee or the inflation index charge; or 110% of the diagnostic-related groups (DRG) payment; whichever pertains to the specialty service involved, determined to be applicable in this Commonwealth under the Medicare program for comparable services at the time the services were rendered, or the provider's usual and customary charge, whichever is less. The General Assembly finds that the reimbursement allowances applicable in the Commonwealth under the Medicare program are an appropriate basis to calculate payment for treatments, accommodations, products or services for injuries covered by liability or uninsured and underinsured benefits or first party medical benefits insurance. Future changes or additions to Medicare allowances are applicable under this section. If the commissioner determines that an allowance under the Medicare program is not reasonable, he may adopt a different allowance by regulation, which allowance shall be applied against the percentage limitation in this subsection. If a prevailing charge, fee schedule, recommended fee, inflation index charge or DRG payment has not been calculated under the Medicare program for a particular treatment, accommodation, product or service, the amount of the payment may not exceed 80% of the provider's usual and customary charge. If acute care is provided in an acute care facility to a patient with an immediately life-threatening or urgent injury by a Level I or Level II trauma center accredited by the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation under the act of July 3, 1985 (P.L.164, No.45), known as the Emergency Medical Services Act, or to a major burn injury patient by a burn facility which meets all the service standards of the American Burn Association, the amount of payment may not exceed the usual and customary charge. Providers subject to this section may not bill the insured directly but must bill the insurer for a determination of the amount payable. The provider shall not bill or otherwise attempt to collect from the insured the difference between the provider's full charge and the amount paid by the insurer. (b) Peer review plan for challenges to reasonableness and necessity of treatment.-- (1) Peer review plan.-- Insurers shall contract jointly or separately with any peer review organization established for the purpose of evaluating treatment, health care services, products or accommodations provided to any injured person. Such evaluation shall be for the purpose of confirming that such treatment, products, services or accommodations conform to the professional standards of performance and are medically necessary. An insurer's challenge must be made to a PRO within 90 days of the insurer's receipt of the provider's bill for treatment or services or may be made at any time for continuing treatment or services. (2) PRO reconsideration.-- An insurer, provider or insured may request a reconsideration by the PRO of the PRO's initial determination. Such a request for reconsideration must be made within 30 days of the PRO's initial determination. If reconsideration is requested for the services of a physician or other licensed health care professional, then the reviewing individual must be, or the reviewing panel must include, an individual in the same specialty as the individual subject to review. (3) Pending determinations by PRO.-- If the insurer challenges within 30 days of receipt of a bill for medical treatment or rehabilitative services, the insurer need not pay the provider subject to the challenge until a determination has been made by the PRO. The insured may not be billed for any treatment, accommodations, products or services during the peer review process. (4) Appeal to court.-- A provider of medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise or an insured may challenge before a court an insurer's refusal to pay for past or future medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise, the reasonableness or necessity of which the insurer has not challenged before a PRO. Conduct considered to be wanton shall be subject to a payment of treble damages to the injured party. (5) PRO determination in favor of provider or insured.-- If a PRO determines that medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise were medically necessary, the insurer must pay to the provider the outstanding amount plus interest at 12% per year on any amount withheld by the insurer pending PRO review. (6) Court determination in favor of provider or insured.-- If, pursuant to paragraph (4), a court determines that medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise were medically necessary, the insurer must pay to the provider the outstanding amount plus interest at 12%, as well as the costs of the challenge and all attorney fees. (7) Determination in favor of insurer.-- If it is determined by a PRO or court that a provider has provided unnecessary medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise or that future provision of such treatment, services or merchandise will be unnecessary, or both, the provider may not collect payment for the medically unnecessary treatment, services or merchandise. If the provider has collected such payment, it must return the amount paid plus interest at 12% per year within 30 days. In no case does the failure of the provider to return the payment obligate the insured to assume responsibility for payment for the treatment, services or merchandise. (c) Review authorized.-- By December 1, 1991, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall commence a review of the impact of this section. Such review may be conducted biennially. (Feb. 12, 1984, P.L.53, No.12, eff. Oct. 1, 1984; Feb. 7, 1990, P.L.11, No.6, eff. Apr. 15, 1990) References in Text.

An attorney may charge a claimant a reasonable fee based upon actual time expended. (b) Unreasonable refusal to pay benefits.-- In the event an insurer is found to have acted with no reasonable foundation in refusing to pay the benefits enumerated in subsection (a) when due, the insurer shall pay, in addition to the benefits owed and the interest thereon, a reasonable attorney fee based upon actual time expended. (c) Payment by fund.-- The Catastrophic Loss Trust Fund may award the claimant's attorney a reasonable fee based upon actual time expended because a claimant is unable to otherwise pay the fees and costs. (d) Fraudulent or excessive claims.-- If, in any action by a claimant to recover benefits under this chapter, the court determines that the claim, or a significant part thereof, is fraudulent or so excessive as to have no reasonable foundation, the court may award the insurer's attorney a reasonable fee based upon actual time expended. The court, in such case, may direct that the fee shall be paid by the claimant or that the fee may be treated in whole or in part as an offset against any benefits due or to become due the claimant.

If a dealer sells a vehicle after verification of the required information for a certificate of title encumbered by a lien, but fails to satisfy the lien or deliver an assignment and warranty of title to the dealer's transferee within 90 days of the date of purchase, and this failure is the result of an act or omission by the dealer, the dealer shall accept return of the vehicle from the transferee and shall refund the purchase price less actual depreciation of the vehicle while it was within the possession of the transferee. In refunding the purchase price, the price shall include the listed dollar value of any trade-in vehicle as stated in the sales transaction document in lieu of returning the transferee's trade-in vehicle. (a.2) Exception for sales at licensed wholesale auctions.-- In the event of the offering for sale or transfer of a vehicle between automobile dealers licensed by this Commonwealth or another state at a wholesale vehicle auction which is licensed by the State Board of Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers and Salespersons as a wholesale vehicle auction, the licensed dealer need not execute an assignment and warranty of title to the transferee at the time of the offering of the vehicle for sale if, prior to the offering of the sale of the vehicle, it is noted that the title is not present. The transferor shall deliver a properly assigned and warranted title to that transferee within ten days of the date that the vehicle was offered for sale, and the sale shall not be consummated until the transferor has delivered the title to the transferee. (b) Duty of transferee.-- Except as otherwise provided in section 1113 (relating to transfer to or from manufacturer or dealer), the transferee shall, within 20 days of the assignment or reassignment of the certificate of title, apply for a new title by presenting to the department the properly completed certificate of title, sworn to before a notary public or other officer empowered to administer oaths or verified before an issuing agent, who is licensed as a vehicle dealer by the State Board of Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers and Salespersons, or its employee, and accompanied by such forms as the department may require.

Upon receipt of such information, the department shall correct the vehicle record of the owner to indicate the name change. The department shall not be required to produce a new certificate of title for a name change because of marriage or divorce, unless the owner submits an application for a new certificate of title.

(a) Absence of subsequent liens.-- Where there are no subsequent liens upon a vehicle, the following rules apply upon the satisfaction of a security interest in the vehicle: (1) The outstanding certificate of title shall be mailed or delivered immediately to the owner of the vehicle with proper evidence of satisfaction and release or the lienholder may apply for corrected title to be issued in the name of the owner. (2) The owner may mail or deliver the certificate of title with proper evidence of satisfaction of the security interest to the department which shall issue a corrected certificate of title without a statement of liens or encumbrances. The corrected certificate of title may also be issued when the outstanding certificate of title cannot be returned and proper evidence is produced that all recorded security interests have been satisfied. (b) Prior or subsequent liens.-- Where there are subsequent liens upon a vehicle or the lien to be released is not a first lien, the following rules apply upon the satisfaction of a security interest in the vehicle: (1) If the lienholder whose security interest is satisfied has possession of the certificate of title, the lienholder shall mail or deliver the certificate of title, immediately upon satisfaction, to the department with proper evidence of satisfaction and release of the security interest.

(b) Application for certificate of salvage.-- An owner who transfers a vehicle to be destroyed or dismantled, salvaged or recycled shall assign the certificate of title to the person to whom the vehicle is transferred. Except as provided in section 1163, the transferee shall immediately present the assigned certificate of title to the department or an authorized agent of the department with an application for a certificate of salvage upon a form furnished and prescribed by the department. An insurer as defined in section 1702 to which title to a vehicle is assigned upon payment to the insured or claimant of the replacement value of a vehicle shall be regarded as a transferee under this subsection, and an assignment of title to an insurer under this subsection is exempt from the requirements of notarization and verification in section 1111(a) (relating to transfer of ownership of vehicle). If an owner retains possession of a vehicle which is damaged to the extent that it qualifies for vehicle replacement payment, the owner shall apply for a certificate of salvage immediately. In this case, an insurer shall not pay vehicle replacement value until the owner produces evidence to the insurer that the certificate of salvage has been issued. A self-insurer as defined in section 1702 shall apply for a certificate of salvage when a vehicle is damaged to the extent that the cost of repairs would exceed the replacement value of the vehicle as certified by a licensed motor vehicle physical damage appraiser. (c) Issuance and effect of certificate of salvage.-- Upon proper application for a certificate of salvage, the department or agent of the department shall issue to the transferee a certificate of salvage which shall authorize the holder to possess or by endorsement transfer ownership of the salvage vehicle. A certificate of title or registration shall not again be issued or renewed for the vehicle except upon application containing the information the department requires, accompanied by any necessary documents required under section 1165 (relating to reconstructed vehicles). (d) Out-of-State salvage vehicles.-- The owner of a salvage vehicle possessing a valid certificate of title or certificate of salvage from a state or jurisdiction other than this Commonwealth does not need to apply for a certificate under subsection (a). If the owner wishes to transfer the salvage vehicle, the owner shall make application to the department and attach the out-of-State certificate of title or certificate of salvage along with any other information and documents the department reasonably requires to establish the ownership of the vehicle and the existence or nonexistence of security interests in the vehicle. The person identified on the application must be located or the owner or lienholder must be domiciled in this Commonwealth to qualify for issuance of a certificate of salvage by the department. (e) Certificate not to be assigned in blank.-- No person shall make application for or assign or physically possess a certificate of salvage or direct or allow another person in his employ or control to make application for or assign or physically possess a certificate of salvage unless the name and address of the transferee is placed on the assignment of the certificate of salvage simultaneously with the name of the transferor. (f) Repairs to personal vehicle.-- Nothing herein shall require a vehicle owner to obtain a certificate of salvage to repair or replace parts or component parts which malfunction or wear out as a result of normal use and operation which has occurred after the vehicle was transferred to the owner.

(a) Staggered renewal system to be established.-- The department shall establish a system of staggered registration renewal in a manner that an approximately equal number of registrations will expire every month throughout the year. In order to implement and maintain the staggered registration system, the department may prorate annual registration fees over registration periods of from 6 to 18 months. (a.1) Seasonal registration.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a passenger car, recreational motor vehicle, motorcycle, truck or farm vehicle which does not have a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 14,000 pounds may register the vehicle with the department for a period of successive months of less than one year. The applicant shall specify the period of months during which the vehicle shall be registered. Except when the department initially converts a currently valid annual registration to a seasonal registration, the annual fee prescribed for the vehicle by Chapter 19 (relating to fees) shall be paid in full by the applicant regardless of the number of months chosen for registration by the applicant. Upon receipt of the appropriate fee and the properly completed form, including all information required by this chapter, the department shall issue a seasonal registration that shall expire on the last day of the expiration month chosen by the registrant. No insurer of a vehicle belonging to any owner or lessee who obtains a seasonal registration and who applies for or receives a reduced automobile insurance premium on account thereof shall be required to provide any contractual coverage, whether in the form of the provision of a defense or the payment of first-party or third-party benefits or otherwise, to the owner or lessee in connection with any event occurring during that part of the year in which the vehicle is not registered; and such owner or lessee shall be treated for all purposes, including, without limitation, ascertaining rights to stack coverages and to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, as a person who does not own that vehicle and has no duty to carry financial responsibility on it for that part of the year. (b) New registration.-- A new registration is effective on the date of issuance of a registration card by the department or the date of issuance of a temporary registration card by an authorized agent of the department under section 1310 (relating to temporary registration cards). (c) Renewal of registration.-- A renewed registration shall be effective on issuance by the department of a renewed registration card. (d) Expiration of registration.-- A registration shall expire on the last day of the month designated on the registration card. (e) Antique, classic and collectible vehicles.-- Antique, classic and collectible motor vehicle registrations shall expire upon the salvaging, scrapping or transfer of ownership of the vehicle, except that if the transfer is between spouses or between parent and child the registration may be transferred upon payment of a transfer fee. (f) Optional permanent trailer registration.-- Except as set forth in section 1920(c) (relating to trailers), the registration of trailers permanently registered as provided in section 1920(c) shall expire upon salvaging of the vehicle or transfer of ownership. (g) Election.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a motor vehicle, except a motor vehicle registered under the International Registration Plan and a motor vehicle with a seasonal registration or a circus or carnival plate, may elect to pay an annual registration fee for a two-year period.

(a) General rule.-- The department shall, upon payment of the required fee, issue to every qualified applicant a driver's license indicating the type or general class of vehicles the licensee is authorized to drive and any endorsements or restrictions, which license, except as provided in subsection (j), shall contain a distinguishing number assigned by the department to the licensee, the actual name, date of birth, residence address, a color photograph or photographic facsimile of the licensee, such other information as may be required by the department, and either a facsimile of the signature of the licensee or a space upon which the licensee shall write his usual signature with pen and ink. Program participants in the Address Confidentiality Program under 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 67 (relating to domestic and sexual violence victim address confidentiality) may use a substitute address designated by the Office of Victim Advocate as their address. Personal medical data and other information for use in an emergency may be included as a part of the license. Information other than that required to identify the licensee, the distinguishing number and the class of license issued may be included in microdata form. Except as provided in subsection (f), an applicant shall include his Social Security number on his license application, but the Social Security number shall not be included on the license. No driver's license shall be valid until it has been signed by the licensee. (a.1) Veteran's driver's license designation.-- (1) Beginning as soon as practicable, but no later than 18 months following the effective date of this subsection, the department shall issue a driver's license or identification card that clearly indicates that the person is a veteran of the United States Armed Forces. A qualified applicant is an individual who has served in the United States Armed Forces, including a reserve component or the National Guard, and who was discharged or released from such service under conditions other than dishonorable. (2) Upon receipt of an application from a qualified applicant accompanied by such documentation as the department shall require, the department shall independently validate the documentation and immediately issue to the veteran a driver's license or identification card displaying a veteran designation without submitting the application or documentation to the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs for review, approval or validation. There shall be no fee for the veteran designation, but the qualified applicant must pay any renewal or duplicate driver's license or identification card fees. (3) The department and the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall enter into an agreement whereby the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall reimburse the Motor License Fund for the department's actual costs of the issuance of a veteran's designation on drivers' licenses and identification cards. Reimbursement shall be paid from the Veterans' Trust Fund or such other funds available for this purpose. (4) A person who falsely represents himself as a veteran of the United States Armed Forces on an application for a driver's license or identification card is subject to the penalty under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904(b) (relating to unsworn falsification to authorities). (b) Identification card.-- The department shall, upon payment of the required fee, issue an identification card to any person ten years of age or older who has made application therefor in such manner as the department shall prescribe or whose driver's license has been surrendered to the department because of a suspension or revocation of an operating privilege under this or any other title. Program participants in the Address Confidentiality Program under 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 67 may use a substitute address designated by the Office of Victim Advocate as their address. Except as provided in subsection (j), the identification card shall have substantially the same content as a driver's license but shall clearly indicate that it is not a driver's license. Upon failure of any person to pass any examination required under section 1514 (relating to expiration and renewal of drivers' licenses), the department shall, where appropriate, issue a complimentary identification card as an expression of gratitude for years of safe driving. The card shall only be issued upon receipt of the person's driver's license. (c) Anatomical donors.-- Any person who is registered as an anatomical organ donor and who has in his possession a card issued by the recipient organization may attach the card to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card in such a way as to permit the removal of this card should the person no longer desire to be designated as an anatomical donor. Any person may also attach to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card a symbol provided by the Department of Health designating a person to be an anatomical donor. The department shall distribute such symbols at all photo license centers and shall make such symbols available in quantity to any political subdivision or organization on request. Information concerning registered donor status may be included as a part of the person's personal medical data. (d) Medical history record.-- Any person may attach to the reverse side of his driver's license or identification card information relating to his personal medical history. (e) Use of identification cards.-- If a person has an established policy of accepting a driver's license issued pursuant to subsection (a) for the purpose of identification for the acceptance of a check given for payment of purchase or for the cashing of a check, the person shall also accept an identification card issued pursuant to subsection (b) for the same purpose. It shall be a defense to a prosecution under this subsection that the person was not presented with notice of the provisions of this subsection. (f) Waiver.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the department shall issue a driver's license to an otherwise eligible person who has no Social Security number if the person submits a waiver obtained from the Federal Government permitting him not to have a Social Security number. The department may require other identifiers, including, but not limited to, a taxpayer identification number, before issuing the license. (g) Completion of process.-- (1) For purposes of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-31, 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg et seq.), this subsection applies to statutes requiring determination of completion of the licensing process. (2) The process of issuing a driver's license is complete when a license bearing the licensee's photograph, photographic facsimile or image has been issued by the department. (h) Sale of photographs prohibited.-- Neither the department nor any person under contract with the department shall sell photographs of holders of a driver's license or identification card for any commercial purpose. (i) Issuance to noncitizens.-- A license issued in accordance with section 1506(a.1) (relating to application for driver's license or learner's permit) may contain an indication that the license was issued to the person who is not a citizen of the United States and who has credentials or documents issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service or its successor. (j) Undercover credential.-- The department may issue an undercover credential to Federal, State or local law enforcement officials. The department may establish guidelines concerning the issuance of such undercover credentials and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of these licenses and their issuance.

(b) Examination of applicants for renewal.-- The department may require persons applying for renewal of a driver's license to take and successfully pass a physical examination or a vision examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist, or both examinations, if the department has reason to believe, either based on knowledge of the person or on statistical inference, that the person may be a traffic safety hazard.

Where the licensee was a commercial driver at the time of the violation, the department shall maintain records or make notations for all convictions of any violation, in any motor vehicle, of a State or local traffic control law, except a parking violation, and also for any other convictions that are relevant to the licensee's operating privilege.

If the person has been previously convicted of the charge and suspension was imposed by the department, which suspension was either partially or fully served, the department may keep a record of the offense for the purpose of showing the suspension was imposed against the person, but the offense shall not be used for the purpose of calculating the requisite number of offenses under section 1542 (relating to revocation of habitual offender's license). In addition, the department may keep records of charges that have been filed with the courts in order to determine a person's eligibility for a probationary license under the provisions of section 1554(b)(3) (relating to probationary license). All records maintained pursuant to this subsection shall be maintained for administrative and law enforcement use only and shall not be released for any other purpose, except where the person was a commercial driver at the time of the violation and the charge was dismissed as part of the person's acceptance of Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition.

(b) Offenses involving hazardous materials or a bus.-- Except as set forth in subsection (b.1), the department shall disqualify any person from driving a commercial motor vehicle for three years if any of the first offenses in subsection (a) or first refusal in section 1613 (relating to implied consent requirements for commercial motor vehicle drivers) occurred either while transporting a hazardous material required to be placarded or while operating a vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver. (b.1) Offenses involving out-of-service orders and a bus or hazardous materials.-- The department shall disqualify any person for two years for a first violation of operating a commercial motor vehicle while the driver or vehicle is subject to an out-of-service order if the violation occurred either while transporting a hazardous material required to be placarded, or while operating a vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver. (c) Two violations of certain offenses.-- Except as set forth in subsection (c.1), the department shall disqualify for life any person convicted of two or more violations of any of the offenses specified in subsection (a), or the subject of two or more reports of test refusal as specified in section 1613, or any combination of those offenses and/or refusals, arising from two or more separate and distinct incidents. Only offenses committed after the effective date of this chapter may be considered in applying this subsection. (c.1) Subsequent violations of out-of-service orders.-- The department shall disqualify any person from driving a commercial motor vehicle for three years for a second or subsequent violation in a ten-year period of driving while subject to an out-of-service order and for a period of five years if the offense occurred either while transporting a hazardous material required to be placarded, or while operating a vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver.

(m) Limitation on noncommercial motor vehicle-based disqualifications.-- A violation which occurred prior to the effective date of this subsection and which did not involve a commercial motor vehicle shall not be considered by the department for purposes of applying a disqualification pursuant to this section. (n) Consecutive application.-- All disqualifications shall be imposed consecutively. (o) Fraud disqualification.-- The department shall disqualify an individual from driving a commercial motor vehicle for one year upon receiving a certified record of the driver's conviction of fraud relating to the issuance of a commercial driver learner's permit or commercial driver's license, and the commercial driver's license designation shall be removed from the driver's license. Unless otherwise ineligible, a driver may apply for a commercial driver learner's permit upon restoration of the operating privilege.

(a) Financial responsibility requirements.-- (1) Each insurer, not less than 45 days prior to the first renewal of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall notify in writing each named insured of the availability of two alternatives of full tort insurance and limited tort insurance described in subsections (c) and (d). The notice shall be a standardized form adopted by the commissioner and shall include the following language: NOTICE TO NAMED INSUREDS A. \"Limited Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania give you the right to choose a form of insurance that limits your right and the right of members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses, but not for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages unless the injuries suffered fall within the definition of \"serious injury\" as set forth in the policy or unless one of several other exceptions noted in the policy applies. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"limited tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. B. \"Full Tort\" Option--The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also give you the right to choose a form of insurance under which you maintain an unrestricted right for you and the members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses and may also seek financial compensation for pain and suffering and other nonmonetary damages as a result of injuries caused by other drivers. The annual premium for basic coverage as required by law under this \"full tort\" option is $ . Additional coverages under this option are available at additional cost. C. You may contact your insurance agent, broker or company to discuss the cost of other coverages. D. If you wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A, you must sign this notice where indicated below and return it. If you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"limited tort\" option described in paragraph A: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date E. If you wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B, you may sign this notice where indicated below and return it. However, if you do not sign and return this notice, you will be considered to have chosen the \"full tort\" coverage as described in paragraph B and you will be charged the \"full tort\" premium. I wish to choose the \"full tort\" option described in paragraph B: ________________________________________ ________________________________________ Named Insured Date (2) Insurers shall print the above notice containing both options on one sheet in prominent type and place in a prominent location. Any person signing, or otherwise bound by, a document containing such terms is bound by such election and is precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed in making the election between full tort or limited tort alternatives. Where there are two or more named insureds on a policy, any named insured may make the full or limited tort election provided for in this section for all named insureds on the policy. (3) If a named insured who receives a notice under paragraph (1) does not indicate a choice within 20 days, the insurer shall send a second notice. The second notice shall be in a form identical to the first notice, except that it shall be identified as a second and final notice. If a named insured has not responded to either notice ten days prior to the renewal date, the named insured and those he is empowered by this section to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. All notices required by this section shall advise that if no tort election is made, the named insured and those he is empowered to bind by his choice are conclusively presumed to have chosen the full tort alternative. Any person subject to the limited tort option by virtue of this section shall be precluded from claiming liability of any person based upon being inadequately informed. (4) Each insurer, prior to the first issuance of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy on and after July 1, 1990, shall provide each applicant with the notice required by paragraph (1). A policy may not be issued until the applicant has been provided an opportunity to elect a tort option. (5) An owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle who does not have financial responsibility shall be deemed to have chosen the limited tort alternative. (6) Nothing in this section changes or modifies the existing requirement that owners of registered vehicles maintain bodily injury and property damage liability insurance arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. (b) Application of tort options.-- (1) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all private passenger motor vehicle policies of the named insured issued by the same insurer and shall continue in force as to all subsequent renewal policies, replacement policies and any other private passenger motor vehicle policies under which the individual is a named insured until the insurer, or its authorized representative, receives a properly executed form electing the other tort option. (2) The tort option elected by a named insured shall apply to all insureds under the private passenger motor vehicle policy who are not named insureds under another private passenger motor vehicle policy. In the case where more than one private passenger motor vehicle policy is applicable to an insured and the policies have conflicting tort options, the insured is bound by the tort option of the policy associated with the private passenger motor vehicle in which the insured is an occupant at the time of the accident if he is an insured on that policy and bound by the full tort option otherwise. (3) An individual who is not an owner of a currently registered private passenger motor vehicle and who is not a named insured or insured under any private passenger motor vehicle policy shall not be precluded from maintaining an action for noneconomic loss or economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (c) Full tort alternative.-- Each person who is bound by the full tort election remains eligible to seek compensation for noneconomic loss claimed and economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. (d) Limited tort alternative.-- Each person who elects the limited tort alternative remains eligible to seek compensation for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law. Unless the injury sustained is a serious injury, each person who is bound by the limited tort election shall be precluded from maintaining an action for any noneconomic loss, except that: (1) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election who sustains damages in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person may recover damages as if the individual damaged had elected the full tort alternative whenever the person at fault: (i) is convicted or accepts Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in that accident; (ii) is operating a motor vehicle registered in another state; (iii) intends to injure himself or another person, provided that an individual does not intentionally injure himself or another person merely because his act or failure to act is intentional or done with his realization that it creates a grave risk of causing injury or the act or omission causing the injury is for the purpose of averting bodily harm to himself or another person; or (iv) has not maintained financial responsibility as required by this chapter, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall affect the limitation of section 1731(d)(2) (relating to availability, scope and amount of coverage). (2) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights with respect to claims against a person in the business of designing, manufacturing, repairing, servicing or otherwise maintaining motor vehicles arising out of a defect in such motor vehicle which is caused by or not corrected by an act or omission in the course of such business, other than a defect in a motor vehicle which is operated by such business. (3) An individual otherwise bound by the limited tort election shall retain full tort rights if injured while an occupant of a motor vehicle other than a private passenger motor vehicle. (e) Nondiscrimination.-- No insurer shall cancel, refuse to write or refuse to renew a motor vehicle insurance policy based on the tort option election of the named insured. Any violation of this subsection shall be deemed a violation of the Automobile Insurance Policy Act. (f) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases when used in this section shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Insured.\" Any individual residing in the household of the named insured who is: (1) a spouse or other relative of the named insured; or (2) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured. \"Named insured.\" Any individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.

(c) Suspension for default in payment.-- In the event the judgment debtor fails to pay any installment as specified by the order, then, upon notice of the default, the department shall suspend the operating privilege of the judgment debtor until the judgment is satisfied as provided in this chapter.

      "text": "§ 1782. Manner of providing proof of financial responsibility. (a) General rule.-- Proof of financial responsibility may be furnished by filing evidence satisfactory to the department that all motor vehicles registered in a person's name are covered by motor vehicle liability insurance or by a program of self-insurance as provided by section 1787 (relating to self-insurance) or other reliable financial arrangements, deposits, resources or commitments acceptable to the department. (b) Nonresident.-- The nonresident owner of a motor vehicle not registered in this Commonwealth may give proof of financial responsibility by filing with the department a written certificate or certificates of an insurance company authorized to transact business in the state in which the motor vehicle or motor vehicles described in the certificate are registered or, if the nonresident does not own a motor vehicle, then evidence satisfactory to the department that the person does not own a motor vehicle. The department shall accept the certificate upon condition that the insurance company complies with the following provisions with respect to the policies so certified: (1) The insurance company shall execute a power of attorney authorizing the department to accept service on its behalf or process in any action arising out of a motor vehicle accident in this Commonwealth. (2) The insurance company shall agree in writing that the policies shall be deemed to conform with the laws of this Commonwealth relating to the terms of motor vehicle liability policies issued in this Commonwealth. (c) Default by foreign insurance company.-- If any insurance company not authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth, which has qualified to furnish proof of financial responsibility, defaults in any undertakings or agreements, the department shall not thereafter accept as proof any certificate of the company whether theretofore filed or thereafter tendered as proof as long as the default continues. (d) Financial responsibility identification cards.-- Insurers shall provide financial responsibility identification cards to insureds which shall be valid only for the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured. If the insured and insurer both agree, the insurer may issue the financial responsibility identification card solely in electronic format. Financial responsibility identification cards shall disclose the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured and shall contain such other information as required by the Insurance Department. In such instance where the insured has financed premiums through a premium finance company or where the insured is on an insurer-sponsored or agency-sponsored payment plan, financial responsibility identification cards may be issued for periods of six months even though such payment by the insured may be for a period of less than six months. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the immediate issuance of financial responsibility identification cards where an insured replaces an insured vehicle, adds a vehicle or increases coverages under an existing policy for which a premium adjustment is required. (e) Immunity.-- If an insured chooses to provide proof of financial responsibility to be viewed in an electronic format on an electronic device pursuant to section 1786 (relating to required financial responsibility), a police officer administering in good faith this subchapter shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability which arises from the insured's choice, including the inadvertent viewing of materials on the device other than the proof of financial responsibility, inadvertent deletion of information from the device, inadvertent interception of a communication while in possession of the device and breakage which occurs to the device.

      "text": "§ 1786. Required financial responsibility. (a) General rule.-- Every motor vehicle of the type required to be registered under this title which is operated or currently registered shall be covered by financial responsibility. (b) Self-certification.-- The Department of Transportation shall require that each motor vehicle registrant certify that the registrant is financially responsible at the time of registration or renewal thereof. The department shall refuse to register or renew the registration of a vehicle for failure to comply with this requirement or falsification of self-certification. (c) Consent to produce proof of financial responsibility.-- Upon registering a motor vehicle or renewing a motor vehicle registration, the owner of the motor vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to produce proof, upon request, to the Department of Transportation or a police officer that the vehicle registrant has the financial responsibility required by this chapter. Proof of financial responsibility may be satisfied under this chapter by production of a financial responsibility identification card in paper or electronic form. If an owner of a motor vehicle is providing electronic proof of financial responsibility to a police officer, the police officer shall only view content that is reasonably necessary to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility. The owner of the electronic device assumes liability for any damage to the electronic device containing the financial responsibility identification card while in possession of the police officer or agents of the department. (d) Suspension of registration and operating privilege.-- (1) The Department of Transportation shall suspend the registration of a vehicle for a period of three months if it determines the required financial responsibility was not secured as required by this chapter and shall suspend the operating privilege of the owner or registrant for a period of three months if the department determines that the owner or registrant has operated or permitted the operation of the vehicle without the required financial responsibility. The operating privilege shall not be restored until the restoration fee for operating privilege provided by section 1960 (relating to reinstatement of operating privilege or vehicle registration) is paid. (1.1) In lieu of serving a registration suspension imposed under this section, an owner or registrant may pay to the department a civil penalty of $500, the restoration fee prescribed under section 1960 and furnish proof of financial responsibility in a manner determined by the department. An owner or registrant may exercise this option no more than once in a 12-month period. (2) Whenever the department revokes or suspends the registration of any vehicle under this chapter, the department shall not restore or transfer the registration until the suspension has been served or the civil penalty has been paid to the department and the vehicle owner furnishes proof of financial responsibility in a manner determined by the department and submits an application for registration to the department, accompanied by the fee for restoration of registration provided by section 1960. This subsection shall not apply in the following circumstances: (i) The owner or registrant proves to the satisfaction of the department that the lapse in financial responsibility coverage was for a period of less than 31 days and that the owner or registrant did not operate or permit the operation of the vehicle during the period of lapse in financial responsibility. (ii) The owner or registrant is a member of the armed services of the United States, the owner or registrant has previously had the financial responsibility required by this chapter, financial responsibility had lapsed while the owner or registrant was on temporary, emergency duty and the vehicle was not operated during the period of lapse in financial responsibility. The exemption granted by this paragraph shall continue for 30 days after the owner or registrant returns from duty as long as the vehicle is not operated until the required financial responsibility has been established. (iii) The insurance coverage has terminated or financial responsibility has lapsed simultaneously with or subsequent to expiration of a seasonal registration, as provided in section 1307(a.1) (relating to period of registration). (3) An owner whose vehicle registration has been suspended under this subsection shall have the same right of appeal under section 1377 (relating to judicial review) as provided for in cases of the suspension of vehicle registration for other purposes. The filing of the appeal shall act as a supersedeas, and the suspension shall not be imposed until determination of the matter as provided in section 1377. The court's scope of review in an appeal from a vehicle registration suspension shall be limited to determining whether: (i) the vehicle is registered or of a type that is required to be registered under this title; and (ii) there has been either notice to the department of a lapse, termination or cancellation in the financial responsibility coverage as required by law for that vehicle or that the owner, registrant or driver was requested to provide proof of financial responsibility to the department, a police officer or another driver and failed to do so. Notice to the department of the lapse, termination or cancellation or the failure to provide the requested proof of financial responsibility shall create a presumption that the vehicle lacked the requisite financial responsibility. This presumption may be overcome by producing clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was insured at all relevant times. (4) Where an owner or registrant's operating privilege has been suspended under this subsection, the owner or registrant shall have the same right of appeal under section 1550 (relating to judicial review) as provided for in cases of suspension for other reason. The court's scope of review in an appeal from an operating privilege suspension shall be limited to determining whether: (i) the vehicle was registered or of a type required to be registered under this title; and (ii) the owner or registrant operated or permitted the operation of the same vehicle when it was not covered by financial responsibility. The fact that an owner, registrant or operator of the motor vehicle failed to provide competent evidence of insurance or the fact that the department received notice of a lapse, termination or cancellation of insurance for the vehicle shall create a presumption that the vehicle lacked the requisite financial responsibility. This presumption may be overcome by producing clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was insured at the time that it was driven. (5) An alleged lapse, cancellation or termination of a policy of insurance by an insurer may only be challenged by requesting review by the Insurance Commissioner pursuant to Article XX of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.682, No.284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921. Proof that a timely request has been made to the Insurance Commissioner for such a review shall act as a supersedeas, staying the suspension of registration or operating privilege under this section pending a determination pursuant to section 2009(a) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921 or, in the event that further review at a hearing is requested by either party, a final order pursuant to section 2009(i) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (6) The civil penalty collected under paragraph (1.1) shall be deposited into the Public Transportation Trust Fund. (e) Obligations upon lapse, termination or cancellation of financial responsibility.-- (1) An owner of a motor vehicle who ceases to maintain financial responsibility on a registered vehicle shall not operate or permit operation of the vehicle in this Commonwealth until proof of the required financial responsibility has been provided to the Department of Transportation. (2) An insurer who has issued a contract of motor vehicle liability insurance, or any approved self-insurance entity, shall notify the department in a timely manner and in a method prescribed by the department's regulations. Upon request of an owner or registrant in the case of an appeal brought by an owner or registrant for suspension under this section, an insurer shall provide a copy of the notice of cancellation or a copy of the insurer's filing procedures with proof that the notice was written in the normal course of business and placed in the normal course of mailing. The department shall not be required to produce such copy or any other proof that notice of termination, lapse or cancellation was provided to the owner or registrant in order to satisfy the burden of proof in a proceeding under this section. (3) An insurer who has issued a contract of motor vehicle liability insurance and knows or has reason to believe that the contract is only for the purpose of providing proof of financial responsibility shall notify the department if the insurance has been canceled or terminated by the insured or by the insurer. The insurer shall notify the department not later than ten days following the effective date of the cancellation or termination. (4) A person who, after maintaining financial responsibility on the vehicle of another person, ceases to maintain such financial responsibility shall immediately notify the vehicle's owner who shall not operate, or permit operation of, the vehicle in this Commonwealth. (5) In the case of a person who leases any motor vehicle from a person engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles, the lessee shall sign a statement indicating that the required financial responsibility has been provided through the lessor or through the lessee's motor vehicle liability insurance policy coverage. The lessee shall submit the statement to the lessor. (f) Operation of a motor vehicle without required financial responsibility.-- Any owner of a motor vehicle for which the existence of financial responsibility is a requirement for its legal operation shall not operate the motor vehicle or permit it to be operated upon a highway of this Commonwealth without the financial responsibility required by this chapter. In addition to the penalties provided by subsection (d), any person who fails to comply with this subsection commits a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $300. (g) Defenses.-- (1) No person shall be convicted of failing to produce proof of financial responsibility under this subchapter or section 3743 (relating to accidents involving damage to attended vehicle or property) or 6308 (relating to investigation by police officers) if the person produces, at the office of the issuing authority within five days of the date of the violation, proof that he possessed the required financial responsibility at the time of the violation. (2) No person shall be penalized for maintaining a registered motor vehicle without financial responsibility under subsection (d) if, at the time insurance coverage terminated or financial responsibility lapsed, the registration plate and card were voluntarily surrendered to the department, a full agent designated by the department to accept voluntarily surrendered registration plates and cards pursuant to regulations promulgated by the department or a decentralized service agent appointed by the department. If a seasonal registration, as provided in section 1307(a.1), has been issued for the vehicle, return of the registration plate and card shall be required only if the insurance coverage terminates or financial responsibility lapses prior to the expiration of the seasonal registration. The department, a full agent or the decentralized service agent, as the case may be, shall issue a receipt showing the date that the registration plate and card were received. The designated full agent or the decentralized service agent shall return the registration plate and card to the department accompanied by a copy of the receipt. (h) Reinstatement of voluntarily surrendered registration plate and card.-- (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the original registration plate and card shall be canceled by the department and destroyed. Any person who voluntarily surrendered a registration plate and card pursuant to the provisions of subsection (g)(2) may obtain a substitute registration plate and card bearing a registration number other than that originally issued from the department, a designated full agent or a decentralized service agent, as the case may be. Proof of financial responsibility in a form approved by the department shall be submitted together with the receipt showing the registration plate and card were voluntarily surrendered. (2) Any registration plate issued under sections 1340 (relating to antique and classic plates) and 1341 (relating to special registration plates) shall be returned by the department to the owner of the motor vehicle upon receipt of proof of financial responsibility. (3) A full agent designated by the department to issue substitute temporary registration cards and plates following a voluntary surrender of registration cards and plates pursuant to regulations promulgated by the department or a decentralized service agent appointed by the department may be authorized to issue substitute temporary registration plates provided proof of financial responsibility and a copy of the receipt showing the original registration plate and card were voluntarily surrendered are furnished. The fees provided pursuant to sections 1929 (relating to replacement registration plates) and 1932 (relating to duplicate registration cards) shall not be charged if the original registration plate and card were canceled pursuant to paragraph (1).

      "text": "§ 1791.1. Disclosure of premium charges and tort options. (a) Invoice.-- At the time of application for original coverage and every renewal thereafter, an insurer must provide to an insured an itemized invoice listing the minimum motor vehicle insurance coverage levels mandated by the Commonwealth and the premium charge for the insured to purchase the minimum mandated coverages. The invoice must contain the following notice in print of no less than ten-point type: The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as enacted by the General Assembly, only require that you purchase liability and first-party medical benefit coverages. Any additional coverages or coverages in excess of the limits required by law are provided only at your request as enhancements to basic coverages. The insurer shall provide the itemized invoice to the insured in conjunction with the declaration of coverage limits and premiums for the insured's existing coverages. (b) Notice of tort options.-- In addition to the invoice required under subsection (a), an insurer must, at the time of application for original coverage for private passenger motor vehicle insurance and every renewal thereafter, provide to an insured the following notice of the availability of two alternatives of full tort insurance and limited tort insurance described in section 1705(c) and (d) (relating to election of tort options): The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania give you the right to choose either of the following two tort options: A. \"Limited Tort\" Option--This form of insurance limits your right and the rights of members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses, but not for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages unless the injuries suffered fall within the definition of \"serious injury,\" as set forth in the policy, or unless one of several other exceptions noted in the policy applies. B. \"Full Tort\" Option--This form of insurance allows you to maintain an unrestricted right for yourself and other members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses and may also seek financial compensation for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages as a result of injuries caused by other drivers. If you wish to change the tort option that currently applies to your policy, you must notify your agent, broker or company and request and complete the appropriate form. (c) Notice of premium discounts.-- Except where the commissioner has determined that an insurer may omit a discount because the discount is duplicative of other discounts or is specifically reflected in the insurer's experience, at the time of application for original coverage and every renewal thereafter, an insurer must provide to an insured a notice stating that discounts are available for drivers who meet the requirements of sections 1799 (relating to restraint system), 1799.1 (relating to antitheft devices) and 1799.2 (relating to driver improvement course discounts).

(2) No insurer shall charge an insured who has been convicted of a violation of an offense enumerated in section 1535 (relating to schedule of convictions and points) a higher rate for a policy of insurance solely on account of the conviction.

(a) General rule.-- An insurance company, and any agent, servant or employee acting in the course and scope of his employment, shall be immune from civil or criminal liability arising from the supply or release of written or oral information to any duly authorized Federal or State law enforcement agency, including the Insurance Department, upon compliance with the following: (1) The information is supplied to the agency in connection with an allegation of fraudulent conduct on the part of any person relating to the filing or maintenance of a motor vehicle insurance claim for bodily injury or property damage. (2) The insurance company, agent, servant or employee has probable cause to believe that the information supplied is reasonably related to the allegation of fraud. (b) Notice to policyholder.-- The insurance company shall send written notice to the policyholder or policyholders about whom the information pertains unless the insurance company receives notice that the authorized agency finds, based on specific facts, that there is reason to believe that the information will result in any of the following: (1) Endangerment to the life or physical safety of any person. (2) Flight from prosecution. (3) Destruction of or tampering with evidence. (4) Intimidation of any potential witness or witnesses. (5) Obstruction of or serious jeopardy to an investigation.

The order may only be made upon motion for good cause shown.

(a) General rule.-- A person or institution providing treatment, accommodations, products or services to an injured person for an injury covered by liability or uninsured and underinsured benefits or first party medical benefits, including extraordinary medical benefits, for a motor vehicle described in Subchapter B (relating to motor vehicle liability insurance first party benefits) shall not require, request or accept payment for the treatment, accommodations, products or services in excess of 110% of the prevailing charge at the 75th percentile; 110% of the applicable fee schedule, the recommended fee or the inflation index charge; or 110% of the diagnostic-related groups (DRG) payment; whichever pertains to the specialty service involved, determined to be applicable in this Commonwealth under the Medicare program for comparable services at the time the services were rendered, or the provider's usual and customary charge, whichever is less. The General Assembly finds that the reimbursement allowances applicable in the Commonwealth under the Medicare program are an appropriate basis to calculate payment for treatments, accommodations, products or services for injuries covered by liability or uninsured and underinsured benefits or first party medical benefits insurance. Future changes or additions to Medicare allowances are applicable under this section. If the commissioner determines that an allowance under the Medicare program is not reasonable, he may adopt a different allowance by regulation, which allowance shall be applied against the percentage limitation in this subsection. If a prevailing charge, fee schedule, recommended fee, inflation index charge or DRG payment has not been calculated under the Medicare program for a particular treatment, accommodation, product or service, the amount of the payment may not exceed 80% of the provider's usual and customary charge. If acute care is provided in an acute care facility to a patient with an immediately life-threatening or urgent injury by a Level I or Level II trauma center accredited by the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation under the act of July 3, 1985 (P.L.164, No.45), known as the Emergency Medical Services Act, or to a major burn injury patient by a burn facility which meets all the service standards of the American Burn Association, the amount of payment may not exceed the usual and customary charge. Providers subject to this section may not bill the insured directly but must bill the insurer for a determination of the amount payable. The provider shall not bill or otherwise attempt to collect from the insured the difference between the provider's full charge and the amount paid by the insurer. (b) Peer review plan for challenges to reasonableness and necessity of treatment.-- (1) Peer review plan.-- Insurers shall contract jointly or separately with any peer review organization established for the purpose of evaluating treatment, health care services, products or accommodations provided to any injured person. Such evaluation shall be for the purpose of confirming that such treatment, products, services or accommodations conform to the professional standards of performance and are medically necessary. An insurer's challenge must be made to a PRO within 90 days of the insurer's receipt of the provider's bill for treatment or services or may be made at any time for continuing treatment or services. (2) PRO reconsideration.-- An insurer, provider or insured may request a reconsideration by the PRO of the PRO's initial determination. Such a request for reconsideration must be made within 30 days of the PRO's initial determination. If reconsideration is requested for the services of a physician or other licensed health care professional, then the reviewing individual must be, or the reviewing panel must include, an individual in the same specialty as the individual subject to review. (3) Pending determinations by PRO.-- If the insurer challenges within 30 days of receipt of a bill for medical treatment or rehabilitative services, the insurer need not pay the provider subject to the challenge until a determination has been made by the PRO. The insured may not be billed for any treatment, accommodations, products or services during the peer review process. (4) Appeal to court.-- A provider of medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise or an insured may challenge before a court an insurer's refusal to pay for past or future medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise, the reasonableness or necessity of which the insurer has not challenged before a PRO. Conduct considered to be wanton shall be subject to a payment of treble damages to the injured party. (5) PRO determination in favor of provider or insured.-- If a PRO determines that medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise were medically necessary, the insurer must pay to the provider the outstanding amount plus interest at 12% per year on any amount withheld by the insurer pending PRO review. (6) Court determination in favor of provider or insured.-- If, pursuant to paragraph (4), a court determines that medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise were medically necessary, the insurer must pay to the provider the outstanding amount plus interest at 12%, as well as the costs of the challenge and all attorney fees. (7) Determination in favor of insurer.-- If it is determined by a PRO or court that a provider has provided unnecessary medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise or that future provision of such treatment, services or merchandise will be unnecessary, or both, the provider may not collect payment for the medically unnecessary treatment, services or merchandise. If the provider has collected such payment, it must return the amount paid plus interest at 12% per year within 30 days. In no case does the failure of the provider to return the payment obligate the insured to assume responsibility for payment for the treatment, services or merchandise. (c) Review authorized.-- By December 1, 1991, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall commence a review of the impact of this section. Such review may be conducted biennially.

(d) Borrowing from the Workers' Compensation Security Fund.-- Whenever the Governor shall ascertain that the cash balance and the current estimated receipts of the Catastrophic Loss Benefits Continuation Fund shall be insufficient at any time during any fiscal period to meet promptly any expenses payable from the fund, the Governor shall authorize the transfer from the Workers' Compensation Security Fund to the Catastrophic Loss Benefits Continuation Fund such sums as are necessary. Any sum so transferred shall be available for the purpose for which the Catastrophic Loss Benefits Continuation Fund is created by law and shall be considered as a loan to that fund. Such transfers shall be made upon warrant of the State Treasurer upon requisition of the Governor. For purposes of determining whether contributions to the Workers' Compensation Security Fund pursuant to section 5 of the act of July 1, 1937 (P.L.2532, No.470), known as the Workers' Compensation Security Fund Act, are necessary, the Insurance Commissioner shall consider the amount of any loan made pursuant to this act as an asset of the Workers' Compensation Security Fund that does not reduce the fund below 5% of its loss reserves and does not trigger the resumption of contributions to the fund. The amounts transferred to the Catastrophic Loss Benefits Continuation Fund may carry over from fiscal year to fiscal year and shall be repaid together with an amount of interest equivalent to the average interest rate derived from investments of the Workers' Compensation Security Fund in the immediately preceding fiscal year as determined by the State Treasurer. An estimate of the actual and projected borrowings and loan repayments to be made from and to the Workers' Compensation Security Fund shall be included in the report required pursuant to section 7 of the act of July 1, 1989 (P.L.115, No.24), entitled \"An act amending Title 75 (Vehicles) of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, creating the Catastrophic Loss Benefits Continuation Fund for payment of certain catastrophic loss benefits; providing for surcharges for certain offenses to provide moneys for the fund; and further providing for conditions of permits.\" The authorization to make transfers pursuant to this subsection shall expire on July 1, 1998, unless otherwise provided by the General Assembly.

These rates shall apply to all policies issued or renewed on and after July 1, 1990. (b) Rate reductions.-- The rates charged by insurers under the filing required by subsection (a) shall be reduced from current rates as follows: (1) For an insured electing the limited tort option under section 1705 (relating to election of tort options), the total premium charged for any selection of coverages and coverage limits shall be reduced by at least 22% from the total premium for the same selection of coverages and coverage limits in effect on December 1, 1989. (2) For an insured bound by the full tort option under section 1705, the total premium charged for any selection of coverages and coverage limits shall be reduced by at least 10% from the total premium for the same selection of coverages and coverage limits in effect on December 1, 1989. (3) An insurer aggrieved by the rate reductions mandated by this subsection may seek relief from the commissioner, which relief may be granted when the commissioner deems necessary in extraordinary circumstances. (c) Approval and disapproval of certain filings.-- Any initial filing submitted by an insurer pursuant to subsection (a), which reduces rates for all insureds from rates in effect December 1, 1989, in amounts specified in subsection (b), shall become effective immediately for policies issued or renewed on and after July 1, 1990, upon receipt by the department and shall be deemed to comply with the act of June 11, 1947 (P.L.538, No.246), known as The Casualty and Surety Rate Regulatory Act, and with Chapter 20 (relating to motor vehicle insurance rate review procedures).

If a deemed filing is so disapproved within 90 days after receipt by the commissioner, the commissioner may order the insurer to pay refunds to all insureds charged inappropriate rates under the filing. The ability to order refunds shall be in addition to other penalties authorized by law. (d) Immediate rate freeze.-- In order to provide stability during the period of transition leading up to the effective date of the amendments to this chapter and to assure fair and equitable treatment of insurers and insureds, it is in the best interest of the Commonwealth to temporarily suspend the adoption of new private passenger motor vehicle rates. Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, all private passenger motor vehicle rates in effect on December 1, 1989, may not be changed so as to be effective prior to July 1, 1990.

(e) Rate freeze after implementation of tort option elections.-- No insurer nor the Assigned Risk Plan may increase any private passenger motor vehicle rates between July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1991. (f) Rate increase justification.-- All rates charged by an insurer during the period between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, may not be increased over the rates in effect pursuant to subsections (b) and (e) by an amount greater than that indicated by an increase in the Consumer Price Index (URBAN), the cost of medical care services, the cost of automobile repairs or other indices of cost increases affecting automobile insurance adopted by the commissioner by publication of notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. (g) Calculation of rates.-- In all rate filings subsequent to the initial filing required by subsection (a), insurers shall allocate expenses, losses and income according to the coverages which generate such expenses, losses and income, provided that each insurer shall provide its limited tort electors with premium savings that equal, in the aggregate, reductions in the insurer's losses created by limited tort electors under the system of tort options established in section 1705.

(ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113 (relating to pedestrian-control signals), pedestrians facing any green signal may proceed across the roadway within a crosswalk. (2) Steady yellow indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green indication is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113, pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. (3) Steady red indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, or if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subparagraph (ii). (ii) Unless signing is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way highway onto a one-way highway after stopping as required by subparagraph (i). Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.

The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection at which a school bus is stopped shall stop his vehicle at that intersection until the flashing red signal lights are no longer actuated. (a.1) Reports by school bus operators.-- (1) The operator of a school bus who observes a violation of subsection (a) may prepare a signed, written report which indicates that a violation has occurred. To the extent possible, the report shall include the following information: (i) Information, if any, pertaining to the identity of the alleged violator. (ii) The license number and color of the vehicle involved in the violation. (iii) The time and approximate location at which the violation occurred.

(2) Within 48 hours after the violation occurs, the school bus operator shall deliver a copy of the report to a police officer having authority to exercise police power in the area where the violation occurred. If the police officer believes that the report establishes a sufficient basis for the issuance of a citation, the officer shall file a citation and the report with the issuing authority. If the issuing authority determines that the report and citation establish a sufficient basis for the issuance of a summons, a summons shall be issued in accordance with general rules governing the institution of proceedings in summary traffic offense cases. The issuing authority shall send the defendant a copy of the citation, together with a statement that it was filed by the police officer named in the citation on the basis of information received.

(f) Operation for nonschool purposes.-- When a school bus is being operated upon a highway for purposes other than the actual transportation of school children to or from school or in connection with school activities, all markings indicating \"SCHOOL BUS\" shall be covered or concealed. During such operation, the flashing visual signals shall not be actuated. (f.1) Use of school buses for transportation of disabled persons.-- Whenever a school bus is being used upon a highway or trafficway for the transportation of disabled persons exclusively and the school bus is equipped with red signal lights, the driver of the school bus may actuate the signal lights in the same manner as set forth in this section regarding the transportation of school children. The driver of a vehicle approaching the school bus shall have the same duties regarding stopping, passing and overtaking as he does with respect to a school bus carrying school children. (g) Exceptions from stopping requirements.-- The driver of a vehicle upon a highway or trafficway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or passing a school bus with actuated red signal lights which is on a different roadway.

(b) Unattended vehicle obstructing traffic.-- Any police officer may remove or cause to be removed to a place of safety any unattended vehicle illegally left standing upon any highway, bridge, causeway or in any tunnel, in such position or under such circumstances as to interfere unduly with the normal movement of traffic or constitute a safety hazard. (c) Removal to garage or place of safety.-- Any police officer may remove or cause to be removed to the place of business of the operator of a wrecker or to a nearby garage or other place of safety any vehicle found upon a highway under any of the following circumstances: (1) Report has been made that the vehicle has been stolen or taken without the consent of its owner.

The officer shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 73 (relating to abandoned vehicles and cargos). (d) Notice to owner prior to removal.-- (1) Prior to removal of an abandoned vehicle bearing a registration plate, current certificate of inspection or vehicle identification number plate by which the last registered owner of the vehicle can be determined, the police department shall send a notice by certified mail to the last registered owner of the vehicle informing the owner that unless the vehicle is moved to a suitable location within seven days of the date notice is mailed, the vehicle will be removed under this section and held at a suitable facility where it may be reclaimed by the owner in accordance with the provisions of section 7306 (relating to payment of costs upon reclaiming vehicle). If the abandoned motor vehicle does not bear an identifiable registration plate, current certificate of inspection or vehicle identification number plate, the notice may be secured to the vehicle. (2) If, within the seven-day period, the owner so requests, the owner shall be given an opportunity to explain to the police officer or department why the owner believes the vehicle should not be removed.

(a) Two-way highways.-- Except as otherwise provided in this section, every vehicle standing or parked upon a two-way highway shall be positioned parallel to and with the right-hand wheels within 12 inches of the right-hand curb or, in the absence of a curb, as close as practicable to the right edge of the right-hand shoulder. (b) One-way highways.-- Except as otherwise provided in this section, every vehicle standing or parked upon a one-way highway shall be positioned parallel to the curb or edge of the highway in the direction of authorized traffic movement with its right-hand wheels within 12 inches of the right-hand curb or, in the absence of a curb, as close as practicable to the right edge of the right-hand shoulder, or with its left-hand wheels within 12 inches of the left-hand curb or, in the absence of a curb, as close as practicable to the left edge of the left-hand shoulder. (c) Angle parking.-- Local authorities may permit angle parking on any highway after an engineering and traffic study has determined that the highway is of sufficient width to permit angle parking without interfering with the free movement of traffic, except that on a State-designated highway prior approval of the department shall also be obtained. (d) Person with a disability and disabled veterans.-- (1) When a motor vehicle bearing a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran plate or displaying a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran parking placard as prescribed in this title is being operated by or for the transportation of the person with a disability or severely disabled veteran, the driver shall be relieved of any liability for parking for a period of 60 minutes in excess of the legal parking period permitted by local authorities except where local ordinances or police regulations provide for the accommodation of heavy traffic during morning, afternoon or evening hours. (2) At the request of a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran, local authorities may erect on the highway as close as possible to the person's or veteran's place of residence a sign or signs indicating that that place is reserved for a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran, that no parking is allowed there by others, and that any unauthorized person parking there shall be subject to a fine and may be towed. The absence of a sign stating the penalty amount indicated in subsection (f) at parking spaces designated with an international symbol for access for persons with disabilities on a sign shall not preclude the enforcement of this subsection. A vehicle may only be towed under this paragraph if the parking space is posted with a sign indicating that vehicles in violation of this section may be towed. (2.1) Local authorities may limit access to a parking space reserved under paragraph (2) to a specific vehicle, license plate or other method of designation. Under this paragraph, local authorities may charge a reasonable fee and shall comply with section 6109 (relating to specific powers of department and local authorities) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327). (3) (i) Except for persons parking vehicles lawfully bearing a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran registration plate or displaying a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran parking placard when such vehicles are being operated by or for the transportation of a person with a disability or a severely disabled veteran, no person shall park a vehicle on public or private property reserved for a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran which property has been so posted in accordance with departmental regulations. Regulations shall require that parking spaces designated with an international symbol for access for persons with disabilities on a sign are posted with a sign stating the penalty amount indicated in subsection (f) and that vehicles in violation of the subsection may be towed and require that signs be replaced when they become either obsolete or missing with all costs to replace the necessary signs to be borne by the persons responsible for signing the particular location. The absence of a sign stating the penalty amount at parking spaces designated with an international symbol for access for persons with disabilities shall not preclude the enforcement of this subsection. A vehicle which is unlawfully parked in a designated person with a disability parking area may be removed from that area by towing and may be reclaimed by the vehicle owner upon payment of the towing costs. A vehicle may only be towed under this paragraph if the parking space is posted with a sign indicating that vehicles in violation of this section may be towed. (ii) Local authorities shall have the power and may, by ordinance or resolution, authorize a person with a disability and severely disabled veterans to issue statements to violators or violating vehicles for violation of subparagraph (i). The form of the statement shall be as prescribed by the local authorities. (iii) No occupancy or driveway permit may be issued to a person whose property is reserved for a person with a disability or a severely disabled veteran if the property is not posted with a sign stating the penalty amount indicated in subsection (f). (d.1) Obstructing movement.-- A person may not obstruct a space on public or private property reserved for a person with a disability or a part of a curb ramp or the access aisle adjacent to a parking space reserved for a person with a disability in a manner that would prevent a person or wheelchair or personal mobility device from entering or leaving a vehicle legally parked in an adjoining space. (e) Unauthorized use.-- An operator of a vehicle bearing a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran plate or displaying a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran parking placard shall not make use of the parking privileges accorded to a person with a disability and severely disabled veterans under subsection (d)(3) unless the operator is a person with a disability or a severely disabled veteran or unless the vehicle is being operated for the transportation of a person with a disability or severely disabled veteran. (e.1) Motorcycle parking.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6301 (relating to prosecutions under local ordinances superseded by title) regarding parking violations, a local ordinance may not prohibit nor cite as a violation the parallel or angle occupancy by one or more motorcycles in any parking space on any highway otherwise available for parking for other individual vehicles, provided that the space occupied by one or more motorcycles does not exceed the space within which a single vehicle must park. In the instance of a violation applicable to any single vehicle, each motorcycle so parked shall be individually liable for any violation as if the motorcycle were the sole occupant of the parking space. (f) Penalty.-- A person violating subsection (a), (b) or (d)(1) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $15. A person violating subsection (d)(2) or (3) or (e) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $200.

Upon issuance of an ignition interlock restricted license to any person, the department shall notify the person that until the person obtains an unrestricted license the person may not drive, operate or be in actual physical control of the movement of any motor vehicle which is not equipped with an ignition interlock system. (c) Issuance of unrestricted license.-- One year from the date of issuance of an ignition interlock restricted license under this section, if otherwise eligible, a person may be issued a replacement license under section 1951(d) that does not contain the ignition interlock system restriction.

Proof of the notification may be established only by the notarized signature of the employer acknowledging notification on a form which shall be provided by the department for this purpose and shall include a contact telephone number of the employer. (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply in any of the following circumstances: (i) To the extent that an employer-owned motor vehicle is made available to the employee for personal use.

(h) Department approval.-- An ignition interlock system required to be installed under this title must be a system which has been approved by the department. The department's approval of ignition interlock systems shall be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. Systems approved for use under former 42 Pa.C.S. § 7002(d) (relating to ignition interlock systems for driving under the influence) and any contracts for the installation, maintenance and inspection of the systems in effect as of the effective date of this section shall continue to be approved and in effect until the department again publishes approval of ignition interlock systems in the Pennsylvania Bulletin and enters into new contracts in support of the systems. (h.1) Mobile installation services.-- (1) Approved service providers of department-certified manufacturers of ignition interlock systems shall be permitted to provide mobile installation of ignition interlock systems within this Commonwealth.

Following the completion of the cancellation, disqualification, recall, suspension or revocation which resulted in the recall of the ignition interlock restricted license, the department shall require that the person complete the balance of the ignition interlock restricted license period previously imposed prior to the issuance of a replacement license under section 1951(d) that does not contain an ignition interlock restriction.

(a) County supervision.-- Notwithstanding the length of any maximum term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to sections 3803 (relating to grading) and 3804 (relating to penalties), and notwithstanding the provisions of section 17 of the act of August 6, 1941 (P.L.861, No.323), referred to as the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole Law, the sentencing judge may grant parole under the supervision of the county parole system to any offender serving a sentence for a violation of section 3802 (relating to driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance) and, if applicable, serving any concurrent sentence of imprisonment for any misdemeanor offense arising from the same criminal episode as the violation of section 3802. The power of the sentencing judge to grant parole shall apply only to those offenders whose sentences are being served in a county prison pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9762 (relating to sentencing proceeding; place of confinement) or section 3804(d). The sentencing judge shall declare his intention to retain parole authority and supervision at the time of sentencing in cases in which he would not otherwise have parole authority and supervision.

(2) The following shall be conditions of parole: (i) If the offender is not determined under the procedures set forth in section 3814 to be addicted to alcohol or another substance, the offender must refrain from: (A) the use of illegal controlled substances; and (B) the abuse of prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs or any other substances. (ii) If the offender is determined under the procedures set forth in section 3814 to be addicted to alcohol or another substance, the offender must do all of the following: (A) Refrain from: (I) the use of alcohol or illegal controlled substances; and (II) the abuse of prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs or any other substances.

(4) Upon notification under paragraph (3), the parole officer shall report the offender's actions to the parole authority and to the department for compliance with section 1553(e) (relating to occupational limited license). The parole authority shall schedule a revocation hearing to consider recommendations of the parole officer and the treatment program. (5) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent a treatment program from refusing to accept an offender if the program administrator deems the offender to be inappropriate for admission to the program. A treatment program shall retain the right to immediately discharge into the custody of the assigned parole officer an offender who fails to comply with program rules and treatment expectations or refuses to constructively engage in the treatment process. (d) Enforcement.-- (1) This subsection applies to an offender ordered to participate in a treatment program under subsection (b)(2)(ii) who: (i) fails to comply with program rules and treatment expectations; (ii) refuses to constructively engage in the treatment process; or (iii) terminates participation in the treatment program without authorization. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all of the following apply to an offender under paragraph (1): (i) The offender's parole, prerelease, work release or any other release status shall be revoked. (ii) The offender shall be ineligible for parole, prerelease, work release or any other release from the correctional facility prior to the expiration of the offender's maximum term unless the offender is permitted to be readmitted to a treatment program. (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to grant a legal right to parole to an offender previously ineligible for parole, on the grounds that the offender is currently prepared to participate in, comply with and constructively engage in the treatment process. Under such circumstances, parole or reparole of the offender shall be at the parole authority's discretion. (e) Follow-up.-- After an offender has completed the treatment program under subsection (c), the parole officer shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the offender does not abuse alcohol, use illegal controlled substances or abuse prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs or any other such substances. These reasonable steps include requiring chemical testing and periodic reassessment of the offender by the treatment program. (f) Fees.-- (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (2), the parole authority shall impose upon an offender subject to this section reasonable fees to cover the cost of any of the following: (i) Chemical testing of the offender required under this section. (ii) An assessment of the offender required under this section. (iii) Drug or alcohol treatment provided in accordance with the assessment. (2) If the parole authority finds the offender to be unable to pay the full amount of the fees required by paragraph (1) and section 1541(d) (relating to period of disqualification, revocation or suspension of operating privilege), it shall require the offender to pay as much of the fee as is consistent with the offender's ability to pay and shall direct the assigned parole officer to establish a reasonable payment schedule for the offender to pay as much of the remaining fees as is consistent with the offender's ability to pay.

(2) If an individual who is insured by a health insurance, a health maintenance organization or other health plan, that is doing business in this Commonwealth, the individual may not be deprived of alcohol and other drug abuse and addiction treatment or coverage within the scope of that plan due to the identification of an alcohol or other drug problem which occurs as a result of an assessment under this section. (h) Additional funding.-- In order to support and augment the diagnostic assessment and treatment services provided under this section, the Department of Health, the department and the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency shall seek all available Federal funding, including funds available through the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services.

      "text": "§ 4706. Prohibition on expenditures for emission inspection program. (a) General rule.-- Except as provided in subsection (b), neither the department nor any other department or agency of the executive branch of State government shall expend any public funds for the establishment and administration of any system for the periodic inspection of emissions or emission systems of motor vehicles. (b) Exception.-- The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply when the secretary shall certify that a system is required to comply with Federal law and is necessary for the Commonwealth to receive or avoid the loss of Federal funds in which case the department may establish and administer such a system for motor vehicles registered in areas where periodic inspection of emissions or emission systems of motor vehicles is required by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States or decrees of the courts of the United States. (b.1) Further exception.-- (1) The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply if the secretary shall certify that a system is required to comply with the Clean Air Act (Public Law 95-95, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.) and subsequent amendments or a final decree of a Federal court and is necessary for the Commonwealth to receive or avoid the loss of Federal funds, in which case the department shall establish and administer an enhanced emission inspection program. This program shall be established in all areas of this Commonwealth where the secretary certifies by publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin that a system is required in order to comply with Federal law. Any area, counties, county or portion thereof certified to be in the program by the secretary must be mandated to be in the program by Federal law. If a petition is required to be sent to the Federal Government in order for any counties, county or portions of any county to be exempted from the emission inspection program, the secretary shall petition the Federal Government on behalf of any counties, county or portion of any county that may qualify for an exemption. In cases where more than one county within a metropolitan statistical area may be exempted from the emissions inspection program, the county with the lowest population per square mile shall be exempted first. In cases where only portions of one county may be exempted from the emissions inspection program, the areas with the lowest population per area of postal zip code coverage region shall be exempted first. If the secretary establishes a centralized inspection program, the following limitations shall be applicable: (i) Vehicle emission inspection shall be on a biennial basis. (ii) No vehicle repairs or vehicle safety inspections shall be performed at any centralized emission inspection facility. (iii) No contractor providing centralized inspection shall own or have any business interest in any vehicle repair facility in this Commonwealth. (iv) For the purposes of this chapter, the department may issue a contract for a period of seven years or more to the successful bidder for the establishment and operation of a centralized program for emissions testing. (v) The department shall promulgate regulations for the conduct, supervision and qualification of a contractor, its principals, employees or agents providing centralized emission testing which shall include a schedule of offenses punishable by fine of up to $20,000 and shall make provision for the discipline, termination, suspension and/or debarment of a contractor, its principals, employees or agents for the violation of a regulation pertaining to the emission testing program. (2) At least 60 days prior to the implementation of any enhanced emission inspection program developed under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall certify by notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin that an enhanced emission inspection program will commence. (b.2) Restrictions on exceptions.-- Notwithstanding any other provision or requirement contained in this title, no provision or requirement of this section shall be more stringent or restrictive than those required by the Clean Air Act. No allowable vehicle emission standard shall be more restrictive than that originally certified for the subject vehicle at the time of manufacture. (b.3) Fees.-- (Repealed). (b.4) Audits.-- (Repealed). (b.5) Repairs covered by warranty.-- The inspection shall be performed so that when vehicles tested under warranty are repaired, such repairs must be covered by the vehicle manufacturer's warranty provisions. (b.6) Retests.-- The first retest performed for a vehicle that has failed will be free. (b.7) Waiver.-- (Repealed). (b.8) Computer costs.-- The cost of connect into the department's computer to facilitate registration, renewal and denial will be borne by both the centralized and the enhanced or basic decentralized emission facilities. (c) Evidence of emission inspection.-- (1) The department shall issue evidence of emission inspection through an official emission inspection station or an authorized agent of the department, valid until the next scheduled emission inspection, for a subject motor vehicle which meets the following criteria: (i) The subject vehicle has passed an inspection or a reinspection performed by the emission inspection station and all required emission control devices are installed. (ii) The subject vehicle is exempt pursuant to the provisions of section 4702(g) (relating to requirement for periodic inspection of vehicles). (2) When a subject vehicle has failed the emission inspection test and continues to fail after the owner has expended an amount at least equal to the total cost limitation as provided in paragraph (3), the owner may apply for a waiver. For the purpose of determining qualification for a waiver, the cost of necessary repairs shall not include the costs covered by any warranty, insurance policy or prepaid maintenance agreement or the costs as referred to in paragraph (4). (3) The waiver limit shall be the minimum required by Federal law. The costs mandated by this subsection do not include any costs recoverable under warranty, insurance policy or prepaid maintenance agreement. (4) Any expenses incurred in the repair of emission control devices found to be tampered with or rendered inoperative or which are not installed shall not be included in the total cost limitation of paragraph (3). (5) It is unlawful to operate a subject vehicle without evidence of emission inspection or certification by an authorized agent, provided that it shall be lawful for a motor vehicle to be operated by the vehicle owner while en route to an emissions inspection station or to a vehicle repair facility where an appointment for emissions-related repairs has been scheduled and, provided further, that such operation occurs no later than ten days after the expiration of valid evidence of emission inspection issued under this title. (6) Subject vehicles presented for emission inspection after the assigned emission inspection deadline shall be charged $10 for each month or portion thereof past the due date in addition to the emission inspection fee, except as provided in regulations promulgated by the department. (c.1) Exchange of evidence of emission inspection.-- A person replacing a windshield or repairing a windshield in such a manner as to require removal of evidence of emission inspection shall at the option of the registrant of the vehicle or the owner of a mass transit vehicle cut out the portion of the windshield containing the evidence of emission inspection and deliver it to the registrant of the vehicle or the owner of the mass transit vehicle or destroy the evidence of emission inspection. The vehicle or the mass transit vehicle may be driven for up to five days if it displays the portion of the old windshield containing the evidence of emission inspection as prescribed in department regulations. Within the five-day period, an official emission inspection station may affix to the vehicle or mass transit vehicle another evidence of emission inspection for the same inspection period without reinspecting the vehicle or mass transit vehicle in exchange for the portion of the old windshield containing the evidence of emission inspection. A fee of no more than $2 plus the fee paid to access the department's computer to enter the evidence of emission inspection into the system may be charged for exchanging evidence of emission inspection. (d) Coordination with vehicle registration.-- (Deleted by amendment). (e) Regulations.-- Upon certification by the secretary of the need to comply with Federal law, the department shall promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to implement the emission inspection program but it shall not promulgate a regulation that would require safety inspection stations to also perform emission control inspections. Regulations promulgated by the department relating to the enhanced emission inspection program shall not be subject to the proposed rulemaking provisions of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law, or the act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as the Regulatory Review Act. (f) Scope.-- (Repealed). (g) Alternative enhanced emission inspection program.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (f), the department shall comply with all of the following requirements: (1) The department shall immediately suspend the development and implementation of a centralized, test-only vehicle emission inspection program until March 31, 1995. (2) The department shall immediately notify the Environmental Protection Agency that the Commonwealth is developing an alternative vehicle emission program and intends to seek its approval of the plan in accordance with the requirements of the Federal law. (3) The department shall develop and submit to the Environmental Protection Agency an alternative enhanced vehicle emission inspection program for approval which meets the requirements of Federal law and consists of a decentralized test and repair program or a hybrid program which combines both decentralized test and repair and test-only components. The decentralized test program may contain an additional component which will test and repair only those components necessary to achieve compliance with Federal clean air standards. As part of this decentralized test program, the department shall utilize the newest and most efficient technologies, including, but not limited to, remote roadside testing, identification and targeting of gross polluting vehicles and alternative equipment to existing inspection technology. The department may incorporate pilot programs and demonstration projects which achieve and enhance vehicle emissions reductions. (4) On the effective date of this subsection, the department shall be immediately prohibited from expending any funds or allowing any other action in furtherance of the development and implementation of a centralized, test-only vehicle emission inspection program until the Environmental Protection Agency approves the decentralized or hybrid system proposed under paragraph (3). Any funds expended by the department after the approval of the program by the Environmental Protection Agency shall be limited to the implementation of the revised vehicle inspection program. (h) Removal from Ozone Transport Commission.-- The Governor shall take the steps necessary to obtain Environmental Protection Agency approval to remove all areas of the Commonwealth from the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission region that are now classified or in the future will be classified as in attainment of the Federal ozone pollution standard or which are unclassified for the purpose of imposing an enhanced vehicle emission system inspection program and other air pollution control measures. The Governor shall initiate the actions necessary under this section no later than 60 days after the effective date of this section. (i) Suspension of program.-- The Governor shall immediately suspend the implementation and enforcement of the Employer Trip Reduction Program until March 31, 1995, or until an alternative program is developed that will achieve the same emission reductions. The Employer Trip Reduction Program or an alternative program shall not be required if the area classified as severe ozone nonattainment is reclassified as a serious ozone nonattainment area by the Environmental Protection Agency. (j) Program for repair of certain vehicles.-- The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to the Credit for Repairing Polluting Vehicles Program which the Department of Environmental Protection may establish. The program may provide that any person could make repairs to or reimburse expenses for repairs to registered motor vehicles which have been identified as polluting vehicles. Upon certification that the vehicle is no longer a polluting vehicle, the Department of Environmental Protection shall award the appropriate emission credit to the person applying for the credit in accordance with the applicable requirements of this title, the act of January 8, 1960 (1959 P.L.2119, No.787), known as the Air Pollution Control Act, and the Clean Air Act (69 Stat. 322, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.).

(a) General rule.-- No mechanic shall conduct motor vehicle inspections or mass transit vehicle inspections at an official inspection station unless certified as to training, qualifications and competence by the department or the department's designate according to department regulations. The regulations relating to mass transit vehicle inspections shall require that any mechanic conducting such inspections shall possess proven competence in the area of mass transit vehicle operation and maintenance. The provisions of this title or regulations adopted thereunder shall not be construed or applied in a manner which would preclude or impair the right of a person who is a resident of another state, and who is in possession of a valid driver's license issued by such state, to be certified to conduct motor vehicle inspections or mass transit vehicle inspections at an official inspection station in this Commonwealth. A certified official inspection mechanic performing a road test on a vehicle for the purpose of conducting a motor vehicle inspection is not required to hold a commercial driver's license if the entire road test is performed on private property, provided the mechanic holds a valid Class C driver's license and the road test area is of adequate space and size to perform a complete and proper road test as specified in department regulations. No official inspection station appointment shall be issued or renewed unless a certified official inspection mechanic is employed there. (b) Supervision and suspension.-- The department shall supervise mechanics certified under this section and may suspend the certification issued to a mechanic or may impose a monetary penalty if it finds that the mechanic has improperly conducted inspections or has violated or failed to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or regulations adopted by the department. The department shall maintain a list of all certified mechanics and of those whose certification has been suspended. Any suspended certificate shall be returned immediately to the department.

(a) Requirements prior to inspection.-- No vehicle, except a vehicle held by a dealer or manufacturer for which titling is not required or a mass transit vehicle for which titling is not required, shall be inspected unless it is duly registered or titled in this Commonwealth or in any other jurisdiction. The certified inspection mechanic shall examine the registration card, title or other document as specified in department regulations in order to ascertain that the vehicle is registered or titled or that an application for title has been submitted by the vehicle owner. (b) Requirements for issuance of certificate.-- An official certificate of inspection shall not be issued unless the vehicle or mass transit vehicle is inspected and found to be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter including any regulations promulgated by the department. Notation of the odometer reading shall be included on any certificate of inspection or other document as specified in department regulations. (c) Unsafe school buses.-- School buses found to be unsafe and placed out of service by an enforcement agency shall be reported by the enforcement agency to the school authorities. (d) Proof of insurance.-- (1) No certificate of inspection shall be issued unless proof of financial responsibility is submitted to the inspection official, who shall, on the official State Inspection record provided by the department, record the name of the insured, the vehicle tag number, the issuing company, the policy number and the expiration date. The requirement that the inspection official record financial responsibility information shall not be construed to require the inspection official to verify the information submitted. (2) In those cases where the insured fails to present proof of financial responsibility to the inspection official, the inspection official, in addition to denying a certificate of inspection, may provide notification to the department, on the form provided by the department, within 30 days of the insured's failure to present proof of financial responsibility. Failure of the inspection official to make notification under this subsection shall not impose any duty or liability on the mechanic or station owner. (3) Financial responsibility may be proven by showing one of the following documents: (i) An identification card as required by regulations promulgated by the Insurance Department. (ii) The declaration page of an insurance policy. (iii) A certificate of financial responsibility. (iv) A valid binder of insurance issued by an insurance company licensed to sell motor vehicle liability insurance in Pennsylvania. (v) A legible photocopy, facsimile or printout of an electronic transmission of a document listed in subparagraphs (i) through (iv), provided the certified inspection mechanic receives the photocopy, facsimile or printout directly from a licensed insurance company or licensed insurance agency. The certified inspection mechanic shall not accept a photocopy, facsimile or printout unless it is provided on the letterhead of the licensed insurance company or licensed insurance agency, or is provided with a letter written upon the company's or agency's letterhead, which specifically references the document provided as proof of financial responsibility by describing the insured's name and address and the make, model and vehicle identification number of the insured vehicle. (4) If handwritten proof of financial responsibility is acceptable proof of insurance in the state where the vehicle is registered, the certified inspection mechanic may accept such handwritten proof, provided the certified inspection mechanic receives written confirmation from the applicable state, insurance company or insurance agency that handwritten proof is acceptable in that state. This paragraph is applicable only to vehicles registered in a state other than this Commonwealth. (e) Penalty.-- An inspection official who fails to complete the official State Inspection record under subsection (d) or who issues a certificate of inspection with reason to know that there has been a violation of section 7122(4) (relating to altered, forged or counterfeit documents and plates) commits a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $100. This subsection does not impose vicarious liability upon the station owner. The criminal liability of the station owner is dependent upon actual commission of the offense or upon solicitation, attempt or conspiracy to commit the offense.

      "text": "§ 4902. Restrictions on use of highways and bridges. (a) Restrictions based on condition of highway or bridge.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge only when they determine by conducting an engineering and traffic study as provided for in department regulations that the highway or bridge may be damaged or destroyed unless use by vehicles is prohibited or the permissible size or weight of vehicles is reduced. (2) School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (2.1) Government-owned vehicles, vehicles of local government agency contractors providing material for maintenance and department contractors engaged in or providing material for construction or maintenance shall be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways, except bridges, imposed under this subsection in accordance with department regulations. The following types of documents shall constitute evidence that a vehicle is traveling to or from a site in accordance with this paragraph: (i) A bill of lading. (ii) A shipping order. (iii) A service order or other document that indicates the address of the site and purpose of the trip. (3) The department may issue a statement of policy, which shall take effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, adopting an appropriate methodology to provide letters of local determination that identify particular vehicles, routes or uses as local in nature. (4) The methodology under paragraph (3) may allow for exemptions from 67 Pa. Code Ch. 189 (relating to hauling in excess of posted weight limit) related to the at-risk industry of logging or other forest products experiencing a 20% decline in Statewide employment between March 2002 and March 2011, as determined by the Department of Labor and Industry. (5) The exemptions and related requirements under paragraph (4) may remain in existence only until December 31, 2028. Exemptions for local delivery or pickup may not include traffic going to or coming from a site at which minerals, natural gas or natural resources are developed, harvested or extracted, notwithstanding whether the site is located at a residence, a commercial site or on farmland. Delivery or pickup of logs or other forest products to or from permanent processing mills located on or reachable only through posted highways shall be considered local delivery or pickup. Delivery or pickup of coal to or from permanent coal reprocessing or preparation plants located on or reachable only through posted highways and not on the same posted highway as a site at which coal is extracted shall be considered local delivery or pickup. (b) Restrictions based on traffic conditions.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge whenever they determine that hazardous traffic conditions or other safety factors require such a prohibition or restriction. School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (c) Permits and security.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities may issue permits for movement of vehicles of size and weight in excess of restrictions promulgated under subsections (a) and (b) with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdiction and may require such agreement or security as they deem necessary to cover the cost of repairs and restoration necessitated by the permitted movement of vehicles. In reference to subsection (a), the Commonwealth and local authorities shall not refuse to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction if there is no reasonable alternate route available. For purposes of this section, \"reasonable alternate route\" shall mean a route meeting the criteria set forth in department regulations relating to traffic and engineering studies. (2) The department may establish the types of permits to be issued and agreements to be entered into, subject to the following: (i) Permits may be for long-term or short-term use of the posted highways. (ii) The department may require multiple vehicles traveling to or from a single destination to operate pursuant to a single permit. (iii) The department may establish a permit type allowing the posting authority to determine that damage to the posted highway covered by the permit will be minimal. This type of permit may include categories based on the number and kinds of loads expected, including a category providing that use of the posted highway under a single minimum-use permit of less than 700 loads per year shall not require an agreement or security. The department may alter the 700 loads per year minimum-use threshold if it determines the structural capacity of the State highways can accept a higher or lower amount of over-posted weight traffic. The department may express the threshold as a loads-per-day, loads-per-week or loads-per-month number. (iv) The department may restrict use of de minimis and minimum-use permits during thaw periods as determined by the department. (v) The department shall exclude hauling related to unconventional oil and gas development from minimum-use status based on its disproportionate and qualitatively different impact upon highways and bridges. (3) The department shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. During the two years immediately following the effective date of this section, the department may promulgate temporary regulations, which shall expire no later than three years following the effective date of this paragraph or upon promulgation of final regulations, whichever occurs first. Temporary regulations promulgated by the department under this paragraph shall not be subject to any of the following: (i) Sections 201, 202 and 203 of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law. (ii) The Act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as the Regulatory Review Act. (d) Designation of alternate routes.-- (1) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsections (a) and (b), the Commonwealth may designate alternate routes for vehicles in excess of specified weights or sizes. Such alternate routes may utilize portions of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. (2) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsection (c), when refusing to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an alternate route study. The elements of an engineering and traffic study conducted to designate an alternate route pursuant to this section shall consist of the same elements found in department regulations. (e) Erection of signs.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities shall erect or cause to be erected and maintained restriction signs designating the restrictions within 25 feet of each end of a bridge or portion of highway restricted as provided in subsection (a) or (b). In the case of a restriction on a bridge or on a highway which does not begin or end at an intersection with an unrestricted highway, the Commonwealth or local authorities shall also place an advance informational sign at the intersection nearest each end of the restricted bridge or portion of highway which would allow drivers to avoid the restricted bridge or portion of highway. No person shall be convicted of violating subsection (a) or (b) unless the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the direction the person was driving was posted as required in this subsection. However, failure to post the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the opposite direction or failure to post any advance informational sign shall not constitute a defense to a violation of this section. (f) Actions to be in accordance with department regulations.-- All actions taken under authority of this section shall be taken in accordance with department regulations. (f.1) Local ordinances superseded.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, local authorities are prohibited from enacting or enforcing ordinances inconsistent with the provisions contained in this section. (g) Penalty.-- (1) Any person operating a vehicle or combination upon a highway or bridge in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (a) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $75, except that any person convicted of operating a vehicle with a gross weight in excess of a posted weight shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $150 plus $150 for each 500 pounds, or part thereof, in excess of 3,000 pounds over the maximum allowable weight. (2) Any person operating a vehicle or combination in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (b) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $500. (h) (Reserved). (i) Authority to conduct investigations and audits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an investigation and audit of a person or entity to determine if there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement. Audits shall be limited to proper usage of letters of local determination and de minimis and minimum-use permits. (j) Authority to suspend, revoke or deny permits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may suspend, revoke or deny a permit and agreement if it is determined by the Commonwealth or a local authority that there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

      "text": "§ 4981. Weighing and measurement of vehicles. (a) Authority of police officers and qualified department employees.-- A police officer or qualified department employee is authorized to require the driver of a vehicle or combination to stop and submit the vehicle or combination to be measured and weighed. Weighing may be done by using either portable or stationary scales, provided that when portable scales more than one inch in height are used, sufficient ramp blocks shall be made available to allow the vehicle or combination to mount the scales safely. The weighing shall be conducted by qualified personnel who have been trained in the use of weighing equipment in a training program approved by an agency of the Commonwealth. The personnel performing the weighing on all highways and interstates in this Commonwealth shall inform the drivers of the vehicle of the right to readjust or rearrange the load under section 4982(c) (relating to reducing or readjusting loads of vehicles). The driver or owner, if present, of a vehicle or combination may, at the time of weighing, witness in an orderly fashion the weighing procedure. If the driver wishes to witness the procedure from outside the cab of the vehicle, he shall be required to turn off the engine, put the transmission in gear and set the emergency brake before leaving the cab. A police officer or qualified department employee may require that a vehicle or combination be driven to the nearest stationary scales if the scales are within two miles. (b) Scales on freeways.-- The Department of Transportation, in cooperation with the Pennsylvania State Police, shall operate on freeways at points which it deems necessary scales and other equipment for detecting violations of the size and weight limitations prescribed by this chapter. The department may also contract with persons or local authorities to use their scales. (c) Tolerance when weighing axles.-- A 3% tolerance per axle shall be permitted when a vehicle is weighed on stationary or portable scales. This tolerance shall not apply on any interstate highway to vehicles weighed on stationary scales. (d) Reweighing at request of driver or owner.-- Whenever scales operated by other than the department indicate that a vehicle, wheel, axle or pair of axles is overweight, the driver or owner may elect to have the vehicle reweighed on the nearest available scales which have been certified by the Department of Agriculture. The lower reading of the two scales shall determine whether charges shall be filed under this section. (e) Certification of accuracy of portable scales.-- (1) Portable scales shall be calibrated for the purpose of certification of accuracy by the Department of General Services. A certificate from the Department of General Services showing that portable scales were calibrated and found to be accurate shall be competent and prima facie evidence of those facts in every proceeding in which a violation of this chapter is charged. (2) Portable scales shall be calibrated as follows: (i) Annually. (ii) Following any event that could affect the accuracy of the portable scale or following repairs or failures. If a portable scale is calibrated under this subparagraph, the portable scale shall not need to be calibrated for a period of one year. (f) Certification of qualified personnel.-- The competency of a witness to testify concerning the weighing of a vehicle may be established by a certificate from an agency of the Commonwealth showing that the person was trained in the use of weighing equipment in a training program approved by a Commonwealth agency. This certification shall be admissible as competent and prima facie evidence that the person is qualified and trained in the use of weighing equipment in such a training program.

The factors shall include, but not be limited to, the volume of traffic and the number of accidents that occurred in each of the three preceding years. (c) Agreements to waive department approval.-- The department may enter into agreements with local authorities transferring to them the authority to install official traffic-control devices without specific State approval provided they conduct traffic and engineering investigations which conform with the rules and regulations promulgated by the department.

Prior to transferring the vehicle, the dealer shall obtain from the transferor a secure power of attorney authorizing the dealer to transfer to the title all information pertaining to odometers that is required to be disclosed by this title and Federal law, in lieu of the transferor providing such information on the certificate of title. In addition to any other documents required by the department, the dealer shall submit to the department the following: (1) If the transferred vehicle is a retail sale and is to be titled in this Commonwealth, the dealer shall submit the secure power of attorney attached to the application for title, along with the certificate of title and the established fee.

(3) If the transferred vehicle is to be transferred to another licensed dealer, the first transferor dealer shall submit to the department the secure copy of the secure power of attorney attached to a copy of the certificate of title and the established fee. Additional transfers between licensed dealers shall be permitted in accordance with section 1113 (relating to transfer to or from manufacturer or dealer). No more than one secure power of attorney shall be utilized with the certificate of title during this authorized transfer process. Upon application for certificate of title, the secure power of attorney utilized to verify odometer information when the vehicle was encumbered with a lien shall be submitted with the certificate of title.

(relating to electronic signatures in global and national commerce), the requirements of 49 U.S.C. § 32705 (relating to disclosure requirements on transfer of motor vehicles) and any requirements imposed by the Commonwealth. The department may, at its sole discretion, permit the use of a secure power of attorney as described in this subsection for the transfer of other vehicles in addition to salvage vehicles. If the secretary of the United States Department of Transportation promulgates regulations regarding the use of a power of attorney as described in this subsection, those regulations will supersede this subsection in accordance with 49 U.S.C. § 32705(g). (d.3) Certification.-- Nothing in this section shall require the department to certify an electronic signature process or an electronic signature process vendor before accepting a power of attorney that is executed with an electronic signature.

      "text": "§ 7753. Actions for collection of penalties. (a) General rule.-- An action to recover any penalty imposed under the provisions of this chapter may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in this Commonwealth on order of the department and in the name of the Commonwealth. In any such action all penalties incurred up to the time of commencing the action may be sued for and recovered therein and the commencement of an action to recover any such penalty shall not be, or be held to be, a waiver of the right to recover any other penalty. In case of recovery of any amount in an action brought to recover any such penalty the Commonwealth shall be entitled to recover full costs and at the rates provided for civil actions. (b) Duty and liability of witnesses.-- No person shall be excused from testifying or producing any books, papers or other documents in any civil action to recover any such penalty, upon the ground that his testimony might tend to convict him of an offense or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture. No person shall be prosecuted, punished or subjected to any penalty of forfeiture for or on account of any such act, transaction, matter or thing concerning which he shall, under oath, have testified or produced documentary evidence and no testimony so given or produced shall be received against him upon any criminal investigation or proceeding. No person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by him in his testimony. This subsection is not intended to give, and shall not be construed as in any manner giving, unto any corporation immunity of any kind. (c) Plea of guilty.-- A defendant charged with a violation of any provision of this chapter may himself plead guilty to the charge in open court. He may also submit to the judge having jurisdiction, in person, by duly authorized agent, or by registered mail, a statement setting forth the following: (1) That he waives arraignment in open court and the aid of counsel. (2) That he pleads guilty to the offense as charged. (3) That he elects and requests that the charge be disposed of and the fine or penalty fixed by the court. (4) Any explanation that he desires to make concerning the offense charged. (5) That he makes all statements under penalty of perjury. Thereupon the judge may proceed as though the defendant had been convicted upon a plea of guilty in open court. Any imposition of fine or penalty under this section shall be deemed tentative until the fine or penalty has been paid and discharged in full. If, upon receipt of the aforesaid statement, the judge shall deny the same, he shall thereupon notify the defendant of this fact and that he is required to appear before the said judge at a stated time and place to answer the charge which shall thereafter be disposed of pursuant to the applicable provisions of law. (d) Statement of disposition of case.-- Subject to any inconsistent procedures and standards relating to reports and transmission of funds prescribed pursuant to Title 42 (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure), the court before whom any person shall be tried shall, at the termination of the trial or proceeding, forthwith mail or deliver to the department at Harrisburg a certified statement of the disposition of the case or proceeding giving the date thereof, the name of the defendant, the date and place of the violation, the name of each witness sworn in support of the charges and the amount of the fine or penalty paid. (e) Section not exclusive.-- This section: (1) Does not prohibit the prosecution of violations of this chapter in any court of competent jurisdiction in the same manner as other offenses. (2) Is subject to any inconsistent general rules relating to actions for the collection of fines and penalties. (Apr. 28, 1978, P.L.202, No.53, eff. 60 days) 1978 Amendment. Act 53 amended subsecs.

(a) General rule.-- All unpaid taxes imposed by this chapter and section 9502 (relating to imposition of tax) and penalties and interest due shall be a lien upon the franchises and property of the taxpayer after the lien has been entered and docketed of record by the prothonotary or similar officer of the county where the property is situated. (b) Priority of lien.-- The lien under subsection (a) shall have priority from the date of its entry of record and shall be fully paid and satisfied out of the proceeds of a judicial sale of property subject to the lien before any other obligation, judgment, claim, lien or estate to which the property may subsequently become subject, except costs of the sale and of the writ upon which the sale was made and real estate taxes and municipal claims against the property. The lien under subsection (a) shall be subordinate to mortgages and other liens existing and recorded or entered of record prior to the recording of the tax lien. (c) Discharge of lien.-- In the case of a judicial sale of property subject to a lien imposed under this section, the sale shall discharge the lien imposed under this section to the extent only that the proceeds are applied to its payment, and the lien shall continue in full force and effect as to the balance remaining unpaid. (d) Procedure.-- (1) Statements of all taxes imposed under this chapter and section 9502, together with penalties and interest, certified by the secretary, may be transmitted to the prothonotaries or similar officers of the respective counties of this Commonwealth to be entered of record and indexed as judgments are now indexed. (2) A writ of execution may directly issue upon the lien without the issuance and prosecution to judgment of a writ of scire facias. (3) Not less than ten days before issuance of execution on a lien, notice of the filing and the effect of the lien shall be sent by registered mail to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last known post office address. (4) A prothonotary or similar officer may not require, as a condition precedent to the entry of a lien under this section, the payment of costs incident to entry of the lien. (5) A lien under this section shall continue for five years from the date of entry and may be revived and continued under the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code. (e) Statement to department.-- A sheriff, receiver, trustee, assignee, master or other officer may not sell the property or franchises of a distributor without first filing with the department a statement containing all of the following information: (1) Name or names of the plaintiff or party at whose instance or upon whose account the sale is made. (2) Name of the person whose property or franchise is to be sold. (3) The time and place of sale. (4) The nature and location of the property. (f) Notice concerning lien.-- The department, after receiving notice under subsection (e), shall furnish to the sheriff, receiver, trustee, assignee, master or other officer having charge of the sale a certified copy or copies of all liquid fuels tax, fuels tax and oil company franchise tax penalties and interest on file in the department as liens against the person or, if there are no such liens, a certificate showing that fact. The certified copy or copies or certificate shall be publicly read by the officer in charge of the sale at and immediately before the sale of the property or franchise of the person. (g) Lien certificate.-- The department shall furnish to a person making application, upon payment of the prescribed fee, a certificate showing the amount of all liens for liquid fuels tax, fuels tax or oil company franchise tax, penalties and interest under the provisions of this chapter on record in the department against any person.

(ii) Enroll in a payment plan of the amount required under subsection (c.1) divided into monthly payments during the registration period to the Department of Transportation by credit or debit card, check or money order or any other payment method approved by the Department of Transportation. Owners or registrants who elect this option may enroll in a paper form prescribed and furnished by the Department of Transportation instead of electronically. (2) The charges under paragraph (1) shall not include a Federal tax, fee, levy or charge, and an owner or registrant of an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle shall be responsible for paying any tax, fee, levy or charge imposed by the Congress of the United States after the effective date of this paragraph. (e) Concurrent registration.-- The registration of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles shall not be valid unless the owner or registrant enrolls in a payment option under subsection (d). (f) Penalty.-- Failure to pay the electric vehicle road user charge within 30 days of the enrollment date established by the Department of Transportation shall result in a prohibition on renewal of the electric vehicle's or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle's registration.

Individual trip logs, odometer readings and driver signatures shall be among the records required to substantiate exempt use. (3) The department may inspect the substantiating records for an exempt entity at any time. (4) The exempt entity shall cooperate with an agent of the department in an inspection under paragraph (3). (5) An exempt entity that refuses to permit the department or an agent appointed by the department in writing to examine the books, records, papers or other equipment associated with the operation of an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle as permitted under paragraph (3) commits a summary offense and shall pay a fine of $500 for each electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle owned or operated by the exempt entity. (m) Refunds.-- A person may be entitled to a refund of the electric vehicle road user charge paid for a vehicle that would otherwise have been exempt under section 9004. A person entitled to a refund of the electric vehicle road use fee shall apply for an annual refund in a manner similar to the refund process used for liquid fuels, fuels and alternative fuels under section 9017. (n) Rental vehicles.-- The electric vehicle road user charge under this section shall be considered a rental vehicle licensing and title fee imposed by the Commonwealth under this title for the purposes of section 1603-A of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971.

(a) General rule.-- The department shall distribute highway appropriations and executive authorizations for State highway maintenance in the various county maintenance districts in the following manner: (1) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are equal to the combined total base allocations for all the county maintenance districts, each maintenance district shall receive its base allocation. (2) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are less than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, each maintenance district's share shall be reduced, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocation within the funding limits, in the same proportion that each county's base allocations bears to the combined total of all counties' base allocations. (3) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are greater than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, the funds shall be distributed based upon the formula in subsection (b), but notwithstanding the formula calculation for any particular county, no county shall receive less than its base allocation in any year. (b) Formula for distribution.-- The department shall distribute to each county maintenance district: (1) an amount equal to the county's base allocation; plus (2) an amount based on the following incremental formula in which each county shall receive a portion of State highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations in excess of the total of all counties' base allocations, expressed in the following manner: ASHMA (40% RPQc + 15% BMDc + 30% LMc + 15% VMc). (c) Establishment of applicable data.-- The applicable data for all counties corresponding to each individual factor in the incremental formula in subsection (b) shall be established and certified by the Governor by May 1 of each year based on the best information available at that time for the immediately preceding five-year period with the exception of BMD. The submission of data relative to BMD shall only include the immediately preceding 12-month period beginning with fiscal year 1997-1998. In each subsequent fiscal year, an additional year of data relative to BMD shall be added until such time as data from a five-year period has been accumulated. (d) Effect of insufficient funds.-- In the event sufficient funds are not available to fully fund all county maintenance districts under the formula in subsection (b) due to the hold harmless provision in subsection (a), each county maintenance district receiving an increase above its base allocation shall have its share reduced in the proportion that the increase over its base allocation bears to the total increases over the base allocation of all counties entitled to an increase, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocations within the funding limit.

(b) Refund procedure.-- If the department shall refuse to allow a refund in the amount claimed by the applicant, the applicant may within 30 days of the mailing date of the notice of such refusal request a formal hearing on the application for a refund. The hearing shall be held after written notice to the applicant of not less than 20 days. Whenever any refund is ordered, it shall be paid out of the Motor License Fund. As much of the moneys received as payment of the tax, interest and penalties under this chapter as shall be necessary for the payment of the refunds provided for in this chapter is hereby appropriated for the payment of such refunds.

(a) Findings.-- The General Assembly hereby finds that imposition of a tax on oil company revenues should provide the Department of Transportation with an annual growth in revenues which offsets the growth in highway maintenance and construction costs more effectively than the annual changes in revenues produced by the flat-rate tax on the retail price of gasoline and by the various other taxes and fees levied on behalf of the department. As a result of such a tax on oil company revenues, the Department of Transportation should have sufficient revenues to carry out necessary maintenance and construction activities with less frequent increases in highway taxes and fees than the General Assembly has enacted in recent years. One effect of less frequent requests for highway tax and fee increases could be a significant decrease in the ability of the General Assembly to oversee the activities of the Department of Transportation. Accordingly, the General Assembly finds that responsible legislative oversight requires ongoing monitoring of the department's activities and periodic indepth evaluations of its performance. (b) Annual reports.-- No later than 30 days after the effective date of this section, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the 1981-1982 fiscal year. No later than 30 days before the beginning of the 1982-1983 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the upcoming fiscal year. No later than 30 days after the end of the 1981-1982 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the reasons for any major deviations from the maintenance and construction program which had been planned for that member's district during that fiscal year. (c) Performance audits.-- During the 1983-1984 fiscal year, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, a performance audit of the department carried out in accordance with the standards for performance and financial compliance auditing developed by the United States General Accounting Office. The performance audit shall determine whether the department is conducting authorized activities or programs in a manner consistent with accomplishing the objectives intended by the General Assembly and is conducting programs or activities and expending available funds in a faithful, efficient, economical and effective manner. The Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall make a written report of the findings of the performance audit and shall submit a copy of that report to each member of the House of Representatives and each member of the Senate prior to enactment of a maintenance and construction budget for the department for the 1984-1985 fiscal year.

(a) Contents of application.-- Application for a certificate of title shall be made upon a form prescribed and furnished by the department and shall contain a full description of the vehicle, the vehicle identification number, odometer reading, date of purchase, the actual or bona fide name and address of the owner, a statement of the title of applicant, together with any other information or documents the department requires to identify the vehicle and to enable the department to determine whether the owner is entitled to a certificate of title, and the description of any security interests in the vehicle. Program participants in the Address Confidentiality Program under 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 67 (relating to domestic and sexual violence victim address confidentiality) may use a substitute address designated by the Office of Victim Advocate as their address. (b) Signing and filing of application.-- Application for a certificate of title shall be made within 20 days of the sale or transfer of a vehicle or its entry into this Commonwealth from another jurisdiction, whichever is later. The application shall be accompanied by the fee prescribed in this title and any tax payable by the applicant under the laws of this Commonwealth in connection with the acquisition or use of a vehicle or evidence to show that the tax has been collected. The application shall be signed and verified by oath or affirmation by the applicant if a natural person; in the case of an association or partnership, by a member or a partner; and in the case of a corporation, by an executive officer or some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the application. (c) Manufacturer's Statement of Origin for new vehicles.-- If the application refers to a new vehicle, it shall be accompanied by the Manufacturer's Statement of Origin for the vehicle. (d) Vehicles purchased from dealers.-- If the application refers to a vehicle purchased from a dealer, the dealer shall mail or deliver the application to the department within 20 days of the date of purchase. The application shall contain the names and addresses of any lienholders in order of priority and the amounts and the dates of the security agreements and be assigned by the dealer to the owner and signed by the owner. Any dealer violating this subsection is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $50 for each violation. The requirement that the dealer mail or deliver the application to the department does not apply to vehicles purchased by fleet owners or governmental or quasi-governmental agencies. (d.1) Presumption of receipt and grace period prior to prosecution.-- Within one business day of receiving an application referring to a vehicle purchased from a dealer, the department shall stamp the application with a work identification number, which shall include the year and day that the application was received at the department. In determining whether a dealer has submitted an application in accordance with subsection (d), an additional ten-day period shall be calculated and allotted to the dealer to account for any possible delay of the mail or by the department in timely stamping an application as to the year and day received. No issuing authority or court shall extend this period. An application, or copy thereof certified by the department, which displays the stamped work identification document number shall be accepted by any issuing authority or court in any proceeding as prima facie evidence of the date that the application was received by the department. If the displayed stamp is not legible, a certification by the department of the date that the application was received shall be accepted by the issuing authority or court as prima facie evidence of that date. (e) Out-of-State vehicles.-- If the application refers to a vehicle last previously titled or registered in another state or country, the following information shall be contained in or accompany the application or be forwarded in support of the application as required by the department: (1) Any certificate of title issued by the other state or country. (2) A tracing of the vehicle identification number taken from the official number plate or, where it is impossible to secure a legible tracing, verification that the vehicle identification number of the vehicle has been inspected and found to conform to the description given in the application. The department shall provide by regulation the persons who are authorized to verify vehicle identification numbers under this paragraph. (3) Any other information and documents the department reasonably requires to establish the ownership of the vehicle and the existence or nonexistence of security interests in the vehicle. (f) Foreign vehicles owned by military personnel.-- If the application refers to a vehicle last previously registered in another country by a person on active duty in the armed forces of the United States, the department may accept a complete form issued by the United States Department of Defense as evidence of ownership. (g) Specially constructed, reconstructed or modified vehicles.-- If the vehicle to be titled is a specially constructed, reconstructed or modified vehicle, that fact shall be stated in the application. The department may promulgate rules and regulations pertaining to the titling of specially constructed, reconstructed or modified vehicles. (g.1) Verification.-- In lieu of notarization of any document required to be submitted with the application for certificate of title, the department shall accept the verification of a person's signature by a wholesale vehicle auction licensed by the State Board of Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers and Salespersons or its employee, or an issuing agent who is licensed as a vehicle dealer by the State Board of Vehicle Manufacturers, Dealers and Salespersons, or its employee. The name and identification number and the signature of the issuing agent or wholesale vehicle auction or respective employee shall be written in the space reserved for a notarization or verification. If an issuing agent or wholesale vehicle auction or respective employee falsely verifies a person's signature, the department shall suspend the issuing agent's or wholesale vehicle auction's authority to issue temporary registration plates and cards for not less than 30 days. When verification is used in lieu of notarization, the issuing agent or its employee shall verify a person's identity by using at least one form of government-issued photo identification. A copy of the form of identification used shall be maintained by the issuing agent for a period of three years from the date of the verification. (h) Penalties.-- Any person who falsely verifies a signature under subsection (g.1) or a vehicle identification number under subsection (e)(2) or who verifies a vehicle identification number without being authorized as provided in subsection (e)(2) commits a summary offense punishable by a fine of $300.

(a) General rule.-- Any person who has been denied a driver's license, whose driver's license has been canceled, whose commercial driver's license designation has been removed or whose operating privilege has been recalled, suspended, revoked or disqualified by the department shall have the right to appeal to the court vested with jurisdiction of such appeals by or pursuant to Title 42 (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure). The appellant shall serve a copy of the petition for appeal, together with a copy of the notice of the action from which the appeal has been taken, upon the department's legal office. (b) Supersedeas.-- (1) (i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii), filing and service of a petition for appeal from a suspension or revocation shall operate as a supersedeas until final determination of the matter by the court vested with the jurisdiction of such appeals.

(iii) Further review by another court shall not operate as a supersedeas unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise. (2) In the case of a disqualification of the commercial operating privilege, the driver may petition to the court of common pleas of his county of residence, which court may grant a supersedeas ex parte upon a showing of reasonable likelihood of successful prosecution of the appeal. (c) Proceedings of court.-- The court shall set the matter for hearing upon 60 days' written notice to the department and determine whether: (1) the petitioner's driver's license should be denied or canceled; (2) the petitioner's operating privilege should be suspended, revoked or recalled; or (3) the petitioner's endorsement or commercial driver's license designation should be removed.

      "text": "§ 1581. Driver's License Compact. The Driver's License Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: Article I Findings and Declaration of Policy (a) The party states find that: (1) The safety of their streets and highways is materially affected by the degree of compliance with State and local ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles. (2) Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence that the violator engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of persons and property. (3) The continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated. (b) It is the policy of each of the party states to: (1) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles. (2) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states. Article II Definitions As used in this compact: (a) \"State\" means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) \"Home state\" means the state which has issued and has the power to suspend or revoke the use of the license or permit to operate a motor vehicle. (c) \"Conviction\" means a conviction of any offense related to the use or operation of a motor vehicle which is prohibited by state law, municipal ordinance or administrative rule or regulation or a forfeiture of bail, bond or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense and which conviction or forfeiture is required to be reported to the licensing authority. Article III Reports of Conviction The licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee. Such report shall clearly identify the person convicted, describe the violation specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated, identify the court in which action was taken, indicate whether a plea of guilty or not guilty was entered or the conviction was a result of the forfeiture of bail, bond or other security and shall include any special findings made in connection therewith. Article IV Effect of Conviction (a) The licensing authority in the home state, for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to Article III of this compact, as it would if such conduct had occurred in the home state in the case of convictions for: (1) manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle; (2) driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug or under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle; (3) any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used; or (4) failure to stop and render aid in the event of a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another. (b) As to other convictions, reported pursuant to Article III, the licensing authority in the home state shall give such effect to the conduct as is provided by the laws of the home state. (c) If the laws of a party state do not provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the words employed in subdivision (a) of this article, such party state shall construe the denominations and descriptions appearing in subdivision (a) of this article as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a substantially similar nature and the laws of such party state shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to ensure that full force and effect is given to this article. Article V Applications for New Licenses Upon application for a license to drive, the licensing authority in a party state shall ascertain whether the applicant has ever held or is the holder of a license to drive issued by any other party state. The licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue a license to drive to the applicant if: (1) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such suspension period has not terminated. (2) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of one year from the date the license was revoked such person may make application for a new license if permitted by law. The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways. (3) The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license. Article VI Applicability of Other Laws Except as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state. Article VII Compact Administrator and Interchange of Information (a) The head of the licensing authority of each party state shall be the administrator of this compact for his state. The administrators, acting jointly, shall have the power to formulate all necessary and proper procedures for the exchange of information under this compact. (b) The administrator of each party state shall furnish to the administrator of each other party state any information or documents reasonably necessary to facilitate the administration of this compact. Article VIII Entry into Force and Withdrawal (a) This compact shall enter into force and become effective as to any state when it has enacted the same into law. (b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until six months after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect the validity or applicability by the licensing authorities of states remaining party to the compact of any report of conviction occurring prior to the withdrawal. Article IX Construction and Severability This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters. Effective Date. Section 10 of Act 149 of 1996 provided that, in recognition of the technical and administrative limitations under which the Department of Transportation is currently operating, the effective date of section 1581 Art. IV(b) shall be suspended until the repeal of section 10. Section 11(2) of Act 149 provided that the addition of section 1581 Art. IV(b) shall take effect on the date of the repeal of section 10 of Act 149. Cross References. Section 1581 is referred to in sections 1532, 1543, 3804 of this title.",

The invoice must contain the following notice in print of no less than ten-point type: The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as enacted by the General Assembly, only require that you purchase liability and first-party medical benefit coverages.

Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses, but not for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages unless the injuries suffered fall within the definition of \"serious injury,\" as set forth in the policy, or unless one of several other exceptions noted in the policy applies. B. \"Full Tort\" Option--This form of insurance allows you to maintain an unrestricted right for yourself and other members of your household to seek financial compensation for injuries caused by other drivers. Under this form of insurance, you and other household members covered under this policy may seek recovery for all medical and other out-of-pocket expenses and may also seek financial compensation for pain and suffering or other nonmonetary damages as a result of injuries caused by other drivers. If you wish to change the tort option that currently applies to your policy, you must notify your agent, broker or company and request and complete the appropriate form. (c) Notice of premium discounts.-- Except where the commissioner has determined that an insurer may omit a discount because the discount is duplicative of other discounts or is specifically reflected in the insurer's experience, at the time of application for original coverage and every renewal thereafter, an insurer must provide to an insured a notice stating that discounts are available for drivers who meet the requirements of sections 1799 (relating to restraint system), 1799.1 (relating to antitheft devices) and 1799.2 (relating to driver improvement course discounts). (d) Additional information.-- Upon an oral or written request, an insurer subject to this chapter shall provide to the requestor information on the requestor's cost to purchase from the insurer the minimum requested automobile insurance coverages under either of the two tort options described in subsection (b).

(c) First party medical claims.-- No surcharge, rate penalty or driver record point assignment shall be made as a result of an insurer paying a first party medical claim. (d) Notice to insured.-- If an insurer makes a determination to impose a surcharge, rate penalty or driver record point assignment, the insurer shall inform the named insured of the determination and shall specify the manner in which the surcharge, rate penalty or driver record point assignment was made and clearly identify the amount of the surcharge or rate penalty on the premium notice for as long as the surcharge or rate penalty is in effect. (e) Adjustment of cap.-- The Insurance Department, at least once every three years, shall adjust the $650 cap or limit relative to changes in the components of the Consumer Price Index (Urban) to measure seasonally adjusted changes in medical care and automobile maintenance and repair costs and shall make such adjustments to the cap or limit as shall be necessary to maintain the same rate of change in the cap or limit as has occurred in the Consumer Price Index (Urban). Such adjustments may be rounded off to the nearest $50 figure. (f) Notice of refusal to write.-- If requested by the applicant, an agent for an insurer shall submit an application for automobile insurance to the insurer or provide the applicant written notice of the reasons for refusal to write on a form supplied by the insurer and approved by the commissioner. An applicant receiving a notice of reasons under this subsection may obtain review by the commissioner pursuant to the Automobile Insurance Policy Act.

These rates shall apply to all policies issued or renewed on and after July 1, 1990. (b) Rate reductions.-- The rates charged by insurers under the filing required by subsection (a) shall be reduced from current rates as follows: (1) For an insured electing the limited tort option under section 1705 (relating to election of tort options), the total premium charged for any selection of coverages and coverage limits shall be reduced by at least 22% from the total premium for the same selection of coverages and coverage limits in effect on December 1, 1989. (2) For an insured bound by the full tort option under section 1705, the total premium charged for any selection of coverages and coverage limits shall be reduced by at least 10% from the total premium for the same selection of coverages and coverage limits in effect on December 1, 1989. (3) An insurer aggrieved by the rate reductions mandated by this subsection may seek relief from the commissioner, which relief may be granted when the commissioner deems necessary in extraordinary circumstances. (c) Approval and disapproval of certain filings.-- Any initial filing submitted by an insurer pursuant to subsection (a), which reduces rates for all insureds from rates in effect December 1, 1989, in amounts specified in subsection (b), shall become effective immediately for policies issued or renewed on and after July 1, 1990, upon receipt by the department and shall be deemed to comply with the act of June 11, 1947 (P.L.538, No.246), known as The Casualty and Surety Rate Regulatory Act, and with Chapter 20 (relating to motor vehicle insurance rate review procedures). Any filing so deemed may subsequently be disapproved, effective upon seven days' written notice by the commissioner stating in what respect the filing or part thereof fails to meet the requirements of this chapter or other applicable law. If a deemed filing is so disapproved within 90 days after receipt by the commissioner, the commissioner may order the insurer to pay refunds to all insureds charged inappropriate rates under the filing. The ability to order refunds shall be in addition to other penalties authorized by law. (d) Immediate rate freeze.-- In order to provide stability during the period of transition leading up to the effective date of the amendments to this chapter and to assure fair and equitable treatment of insurers and insureds, it is in the best interest of the Commonwealth to temporarily suspend the adoption of new private passenger motor vehicle rates. Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, all private passenger motor vehicle rates in effect on December 1, 1989, may not be changed so as to be effective prior to July 1, 1990. Any rate requests filed with the commissioner to be effective on or after December 1, 1989, whether or not such requests were approved by the commissioner or by operation of law prior to, on or after December 1, 1989, are hereby disapproved as being in conflict with this chapter. (e) Rate freeze after implementation of tort option elections.-- No insurer nor the Assigned Risk Plan may increase any private passenger motor vehicle rates between July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1991. (f) Rate increase justification.-- All rates charged by an insurer during the period between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, may not be increased over the rates in effect pursuant to subsections (b) and (e) by an amount greater than that indicated by an increase in the Consumer Price Index (URBAN), the cost of medical care services, the cost of automobile repairs or other indices of cost increases affecting automobile insurance adopted by the commissioner by publication of notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. (g) Calculation of rates.-- In all rate filings subsequent to the initial filing required by subsection (a), insurers shall allocate expenses, losses and income according to the coverages which generate such expenses, losses and income, provided that each insurer shall provide its limited tort electors with premium savings that equal, in the aggregate, reductions in the insurer's losses created by limited tort electors under the system of tort options established in section 1705. (h) Coverage reductions.-- Insurers shall reduce the premium for insureds who elect to reduce or eliminate first party benefits, uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage required prior to the effective date of this section by the cost of such coverage.

(a) Speedometers authorized.-- The rate of speed of any vehicle may be timed on any highway by a police officer using a motor vehicle equipped with a speedometer. In ascertaining the speed of a vehicle by the use of a speedometer, the speed shall be timed for a distance of not less than three-tenths of a mile. (b) Testing of speedometers.-- The department may appoint stations for testing speedometers and may prescribe regulations as to the manner in which the test shall be made. Speedometers shall have been tested for accuracy within a period of one year prior to the alleged violation and immediately upon change of tire size. A certificate from the station showing that the test was made, the date of the test and the degree of accuracy of the speedometer shall be competent and prima facie evidence of those facts in every proceeding in which a violation of this title is charged. (c) Mechanical, electrical and electronic devices authorized.-- (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rate of speed of any vehicle may be timed on any highway by a police officer using a mechanical or electrical speed timing device. (2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), electronic devices such as radio-microwave devices, commonly referred to as electronic speed meters or radar, may be used only as part of an automated speed enforcement system or by members of the Pennsylvania State Police. (3) Electronic devices which calculate speed by measuring elapsed time between measured road surface points by using two sensors and devices which measure and calculate the average speed of a vehicle between any two points may be used by any police officer. (4) No person may be convicted upon evidence obtained through the use of devices authorized by paragraphs (2) and (3) unless the speed recorded is six or more miles per hour in excess of the legal speed limit. Furthermore, no person may be convicted upon evidence obtained through the use of devices authorized by paragraph (3) in an area where the legal speed limit is less than 55 miles per hour if the speed recorded is less than ten miles per hour in excess of the legal speed limit. This paragraph shall not apply to evidence obtained through the use of devices authorized by paragraph (2) or (3) within a school zone or an active work zone. (5) Light detection and ranging devices, commonly referred to as LIDAR, may be used only as part of an automated speed enforcement system or by members of the Pennsylvania State Police.

(a) County supervision.-- Notwithstanding the length of any maximum term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to sections 3803 (relating to grading) and 3804 (relating to penalties), and notwithstanding the provisions of section 17 of the act of August 6, 1941 (P.L.861, No.323), referred to as the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole Law, the sentencing judge may grant parole under the supervision of the county parole system to any offender serving a sentence for a violation of section 3802 (relating to driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance) and, if applicable, serving any concurrent sentence of imprisonment for any misdemeanor offense arising from the same criminal episode as the violation of section 3802. The power of the sentencing judge to grant parole shall apply only to those offenders whose sentences are being served in a county prison pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9762 (relating to sentencing proceeding; place of confinement) or section 3804(d).

(2) The following shall be conditions of parole: (i) If the offender is not determined under the procedures set forth in section 3814 to be addicted to alcohol or another substance, the offender must refrain from: (A) the use of illegal controlled substances; and (B) the abuse of prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs or any other substances. (ii) If the offender is determined under the procedures set forth in section 3814 to be addicted to alcohol or another substance, the offender must do all of the following: (A) Refrain from: (I) the use of alcohol or illegal controlled substances; and (II) the abuse of prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs or any other substances.

(4) Upon notification under paragraph (3), the parole officer shall report the offender's actions to the parole authority and to the department for compliance with section 1553(e) (relating to occupational limited license). The parole authority shall schedule a revocation hearing to consider recommendations of the parole officer and the treatment program. (5) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent a treatment program from refusing to accept an offender if the program administrator deems the offender to be inappropriate for admission to the program. A treatment program shall retain the right to immediately discharge into the custody of the assigned parole officer an offender who fails to comply with program rules and treatment expectations or refuses to constructively engage in the treatment process. (d) Enforcement.-- (1) This subsection applies to an offender ordered to participate in a treatment program under subsection (b)(2)(ii) who: (i) fails to comply with program rules and treatment expectations; (ii) refuses to constructively engage in the treatment process; or (iii) terminates participation in the treatment program without authorization.

Under such circumstances, parole or reparole of the offender shall be at the parole authority's discretion. (e) Follow-up.-- After an offender has completed the treatment program under subsection (c), the parole officer shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the offender does not abuse alcohol, use illegal controlled substances or abuse prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs or any other such substances. These reasonable steps include requiring chemical testing and periodic reassessment of the offender by the treatment program.

Notation of the odometer reading shall be included on any certificate of inspection or other document as specified in department regulations. (c) Unsafe school buses.-- School buses found to be unsafe and placed out of service by an enforcement agency shall be reported by the enforcement agency to the school authorities.

The requirement that the inspection official record financial responsibility information shall not be construed to require the inspection official to verify the information submitted.

(ii) The declaration page of an insurance policy. (iii) A certificate of financial responsibility. (iv) A valid binder of insurance issued by an insurance company licensed to sell motor vehicle liability insurance in Pennsylvania.

(4) If handwritten proof of financial responsibility is acceptable proof of insurance in the state where the vehicle is registered, the certified inspection mechanic may accept such handwritten proof, provided the certified inspection mechanic receives written confirmation from the applicable state, insurance company or insurance agency that handwritten proof is acceptable in that state. This paragraph is applicable only to vehicles registered in a state other than this Commonwealth. (e) Penalty.-- An inspection official who fails to complete the official State Inspection record under subsection (d) or who issues a certificate of inspection with reason to know that there has been a violation of section 7122(4) (relating to altered, forged or counterfeit documents and plates) commits a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $100.

(a) Authority of police officers and qualified department employees.-- A police officer or qualified department employee is authorized to require the driver of a vehicle or combination to stop and submit the vehicle or combination to be measured and weighed. Weighing may be done by using either portable or stationary scales, provided that when portable scales more than one inch in height are used, sufficient ramp blocks shall be made available to allow the vehicle or combination to mount the scales safely. The weighing shall be conducted by qualified personnel who have been trained in the use of weighing equipment in a training program approved by an agency of the Commonwealth. The personnel performing the weighing on all highways and interstates in this Commonwealth shall inform the drivers of the vehicle of the right to readjust or rearrange the load under section 4982(c) (relating to reducing or readjusting loads of vehicles). The driver or owner, if present, of a vehicle or combination may, at the time of weighing, witness in an orderly fashion the weighing procedure. If the driver wishes to witness the procedure from outside the cab of the vehicle, he shall be required to turn off the engine, put the transmission in gear and set the emergency brake before leaving the cab. A police officer or qualified department employee may require that a vehicle or combination be driven to the nearest stationary scales if the scales are within two miles. (b) Scales on freeways.-- The Department of Transportation, in cooperation with the Pennsylvania State Police, shall operate on freeways at points which it deems necessary scales and other equipment for detecting violations of the size and weight limitations prescribed by this chapter. The department may also contract with persons or local authorities to use their scales. (c) Tolerance when weighing axles.-- A 3% tolerance per axle shall be permitted when a vehicle is weighed on stationary or portable scales. This tolerance shall not apply on any interstate highway to vehicles weighed on stationary scales. (d) Reweighing at request of driver or owner.-- Whenever scales operated by other than the department indicate that a vehicle, wheel, axle or pair of axles is overweight, the driver or owner may elect to have the vehicle reweighed on the nearest available scales which have been certified by the Department of Agriculture. The lower reading of the two scales shall determine whether charges shall be filed under this section. (e) Certification of accuracy of portable scales.-- (1) Portable scales shall be calibrated for the purpose of certification of accuracy by the Department of General Services. A certificate from the Department of General Services showing that portable scales were calibrated and found to be accurate shall be competent and prima facie evidence of those facts in every proceeding in which a violation of this chapter is charged. (2) Portable scales shall be calibrated as follows: (i) Annually. (ii) Following any event that could affect the accuracy of the portable scale or following repairs or failures. If a portable scale is calibrated under this subparagraph, the portable scale shall not need to be calibrated for a period of one year. (f) Certification of qualified personnel.-- The competency of a witness to testify concerning the weighing of a vehicle may be established by a certificate from an agency of the Commonwealth showing that the person was trained in the use of weighing equipment in a training program approved by a Commonwealth agency. This certification shall be admissible as competent and prima facie evidence that the person is qualified and trained in the use of weighing equipment in such a training program.

(c.1) Computation of electric vehicle road user charge.-- (1) The electric vehicle road user charge for an electric vehicle shall be as follows: (i) $200 upon initial registration in 2025 or upon renewal of registration submitted to the Department of Transportation for a registration that expires in 2025.

(2) On January 1, 2027, and each January 1 thereafter, the electric vehicle road user charge shall be fixed annually by the Department of Transportation based upon the electric vehicle road user charge in the prior year as adjusted to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the United States for all items as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the previous 12-month period. The electric vehicle road user charge as adjusted shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.

Owners or registrants who elect this option may enroll in a paper form prescribed and furnished by the Department of Transportation instead of electronically. (2) The charges under paragraph (1) shall not include a Federal tax, fee, levy or charge, and an owner or registrant of an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle shall be responsible for paying any tax, fee, levy or charge imposed by the Congress of the United States after the effective date of this paragraph. (e) Concurrent registration.-- The registration of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles shall not be valid unless the owner or registrant enrolls in a payment option under subsection (d). (f) Penalty.-- Failure to pay the electric vehicle road user charge within 30 days of the enrollment date established by the Department of Transportation shall result in a prohibition on renewal of the electric vehicle's or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle's registration.

(5) An exempt entity that refuses to permit the department or an agent appointed by the department in writing to examine the books, records, papers or other equipment associated with the operation of an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle as permitted under paragraph (3) commits a summary offense and shall pay a fine of $500 for each electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle owned or operated by the exempt entity. (m) Refunds.-- A person may be entitled to a refund of the electric vehicle road user charge paid for a vehicle that would otherwise have been exempt under section 9004. A person entitled to a refund of the electric vehicle road use fee shall apply for an annual refund in a manner similar to the refund process used for liquid fuels, fuels and alternative fuels under section 9017. (n) Rental vehicles.-- The electric vehicle road user charge under this section shall be considered a rental vehicle licensing and title fee imposed by the Commonwealth under this title for the purposes of section 1603-A of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform Code of 1971.
