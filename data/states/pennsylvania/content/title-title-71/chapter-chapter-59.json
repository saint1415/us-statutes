Forfeitures under this subsection or under any other provision of law may not be applied to increase the benefits that any member would otherwise receive under this part.\n\n(ii) In accordance with section 16(b) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and notwithstanding this paragraph, the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act, or 42 Pa.C.S. § 3352 (relating to pension rights), the accumulated mandatory participant contributions and accumulated voluntary contributions standing to the credit of a participant shall not be forfeited but shall be available for payment of fines and restitution as provided by law. In accordance with section 16(b) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, amounts in the trust that have been ordered to be distributed to an alternate payee as the result of an equitable distribution of marital property as part of an approved domestic relations order entered before the date of the order or action in a court or other tribunal resulting in a forfeiture of a participant's interest in the trust shall not be subject to the provisions of the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act or 42 Pa.C.S. § 3352. Any accumulated employer defined contributions forfeited as a result of this paragraph or other law shall be retained by the board and notwithstanding sections 5812(2) (relating to powers and duties of board), 5815 (relating to expenses) and 5902(c) (relating to administrative duties of the board) used for the payment of administrative fees, costs and expenses of the plan.\n\n(3) Rights under this part shall be subject to attachment in favor of an alternate payee as set forth in an approved domestic relations order.\n\n(4) Effective with distributions made on or after January 1, 1993, and notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan by way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this paragraph, a \"distributee\" includes a member, a participant, a member's surviving spouse, a participant's surviving spouse, a member's former spouse who is an alternate payee under an approved domestic relations order, a participant's former spouse who is an alternate payee under an approved domestic relations order and anyone else authorized under the IRC and the plan terms approved by the board to have an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan by way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"eligible rollover distribution\" has the meaning given such term by IRC § 402(f)(2)(A), and \"eligible retirement plan\" has the meaning given such term by IRC § 402(c)(8)(B), except that a qualified trust shall be considered an eligible retirement plan only if it accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution; however, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an \"individual retirement account\" or an \"individual retirement annuity\" as those terms are defined in IRC § 408(a) and (b).\n\n(b) Authorized payments from fund and trust.--\n\n(1) The board shall be authorized to pay from the fund and the trust in the case of a member or participant who is terminating service, the amount determined after certification by the head of the department that the member or participant is so obligated, and after review and approval by the department or agency's legal representative or upon receipt of an assignment from the member or participant in the amount so certified, except that no payment shall be made from the individual investment account of a participant until the participant otherwise applies for and receives a distribution and shall not exceed the amount of the distribution.\n\n(2) In the case of a participant whose former spouse is an alternate payee of an equitable distribution of marital assets under an approved domestic relations order, a lump sum of the alternate payee's interest in the participant's vested accumulated total defined contributions. This paragraph shall apply without regard to whether the participant has not terminated, is terminating or has terminated State service.\n\n(Oct. 7, 1975, P.L.348, No.101, eff. imd.; Oct. 5, 1980, P.L.693, No.142, eff. 60 days; Apr. 29, 1994, P.L.159, No.29; Dec. 20, 1995, P.L.689, No.77, eff. imd.; Dec. 28, 2015, P.L.529, No.93, eff. imd.; June 12, 2017, P.L.11, No.5, eff. imd.; Oct. 29, 2020, P.L.775, No.94, eff. imd.)\n\n2020 Amendment.Act 94 amended subsec.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the exclusive remedy of any member, participant or alternate payee aggrieved by a decision of the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, shall be the right to an adjudication by the board under 2 Pa.C.S.

These orders may be approved notwithstanding any other provision of this part or the plan that would require a distribution of accumulated employer defined contributions in the form of an annuity or to require the purchase of an annuity.\n\n(d) Obligation discharged.--Only the requirements of this part and any regulations promulgated hereunder shall be used to govern the approval or disapproval of a domestic relations order. Therefore, if the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, acts in accordance with the provisions of this part and any promulgated regulations in approving or disapproving a domestic relations order, then the obligations of the system or the plan with respect to such approval or disapproval shall be discharged.\n\n(Apr. 29, 1994, P.L.159, No.29, eff. 60 days; June 12, 2017, P.L.11, No.5, eff. imd.)\n\nCross References.Section 5953.1 is referred to in sections 5102, 5812, 5953.5 of this title.",
