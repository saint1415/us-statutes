The balance of the present value of the maximum single life annuity adjusted in accordance with section 5702(b) shall be paid in the form of an annuity with a guaranteed total payment, a single life annuity, or a joint and survivor annuity or any combination thereof but subject to the restrictions of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) under this option.\n\n(a.1) Additional lump sum withdrawal.--The following shall apply:\n\n(1) If a member has an effective date of retirement after December 31, 2018, and has elected to have the full amount allowed under subsection (a)(4)(iii) paid in a lump sum, or is not eligible to have any money paid under subsection (a)(4)(iii), then the member may elect to receive an additional amount payable in a lump sum at the same time as the payment elected under subsection (a)(4)(iii), if any.\n\n(2) The additional amount payable in a lump sum may not exceed an amount equal to total accumulated deductions standing to the credit of the member on the effective date of retirement related to service credited as Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 or Class A-6.\n\n(3) If a member elects to be paid an additional lump sum amount under this subsection, then the maximum single life annuity calculated under section 5702 and payable under subsection (a) shall be reduced by the additional amount withdrawn divided by the cost of a dollar annuity on the effective date of retirement computed on the basis of the annual interest rate adopted for that fiscal year by the board for the calculation of the employer normal contribution rate under section 5508(b) (relating to actuarial cost method) and the mortality tables adopted by the board for the determination of actuarially equivalent benefits under this part. The reduction in the maximum single life annuity under this paragraph shall apply before the election and calculation of any reduced annuities payable under subsection (a).\n\n(b) Present value of joint coverage annuity.--In calculating an annuity payable to a member of the joint coverage group, the present value of such adjusted annuity shall be determined by taking into account prospectively the reduction applicable upon the attainment of the age at which full social security benefits are payable.\n\n(Oct. 7, 1975, P.L.348, No.101, eff. imd.; June 13, 1985, P.L.40, No.19, eff. imd.; Apr. 29, 1994, P.L.159, No.29, eff.

An annuitant who is credited with an additional 10% of Class A and Class C service as provided in section 5302(c) (relating to credited State service) and who returns to State service shall forfeit such credited service and shall have his frozen present value adjusted as if his 10% retirement incentive had not been applied to his account. In the event that the cost-of-living increase enacted December 18, 1979 occurred during the period of such State or school employment, the frozen present value shall be increased, on or after the member attains superannuation age, by the percent applicable had he not returned to service.\n\n(2) This subsection shall not apply in the case of any annuitant who:\n\n(i) may render services to the Commonwealth in the capacity of an independent contractor; or\n\n(ii) is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year and who may render service to the Commonwealth:\n\n(A) as a member of an independent board or commission or as a member of a departmental administrative or advisory board or commission when such members of independent or departmental boards or commissions are compensated on a per diem basis for not more than 150 days per calendar year; or\n\n(B) as a member of an independent board or commission requiring appointment by the Governor, with advice and consent of the Senate, where the annual salary payable to the member does not exceed $35,000 and where the member has been an annuitant for at least six months immediately preceding the appointment.\n\n(a.1) Return to State service during emergency.--When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public, an annuitant who is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year may be returned to State service for a period not to exceed 95 days in any calendar year without loss of his annuity. In computing the number of days an annuitant has returned to State service, any amount of time less than one-half of a day shall be counted as one-half of a day. For agencies, boards and commissions under the Governor's jurisdiction, the approval of the Governor that an emergency exists shall be required before an annuitant may be returned to State service.\n\n(a.2) Return of benefits.--In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 5705 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to State service or entering school service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member or school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid.\n\n(a.3) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.--In the event that a former State employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount so received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board, but not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave, with the repayment period not to exceed five years or such longer time as may be agreed to between the board and the member.\n\n(a.4) Return to service as a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge.--Notwithstanding the provisions of the act of September 30, 1983 (P.L.160, No.39), known as the Public Official Compensation Law, 42 Pa.C.S.

or\n\n(ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value eliminated,\n\nunless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity.\n\n(3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement. The interest for each year shall be calculated based upon the annual interest rate adopted for that fiscal year by the board for the calculation of the normal contribution rate pursuant to section 5508(b) (relating to actuarial cost method).\n\n(Oct. 7, 1975, P.L.348, No.101, eff. imd.; July 12, 1981, P.L.261, No.87, eff. imd.; Mar. 4, 1982, P.L.141, No.45, eff. imd.; Aug. 5, 1991, P.L.183, No.23, eff. imd.; Apr. 29, 1994, P.L.159, No.29; Dec. 20, 1995, P.L.689, No.77, eff. 60 days; May 17, 2001, P.L.26, No.9, eff.
