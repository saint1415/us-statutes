(a) General rule.-- (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3) and (4), the right of a person to any benefit or right accrued or accruing under the provisions of this part and the moneys in the fund and the trust are hereby exempt from any State or municipal tax, levy and sale, garnishment, attachment, spouse's election, the provisions of Article XIII.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code, or any other process whatsoever, and no participant or beneficiary, successor payee or alternate payee of a participant shall have the ability to commute, sell, assign, alienate, anticipate, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, commutate or otherwise transfer or convey any benefit or interest in an individual investment account or rights to receive or direct distributions under this part or under agreements entered into under this part except as provided in this part, and in the case of either a member or a participant except for a set-off by the Commonwealth in the case provided in this paragraph, and shall be unassignable except to the Commonwealth in the case of a member or participant who is terminating State service and has been determined to be obligated to the Commonwealth for the repayment of money owed on account of his employment. (2) (i) Rights under this part shall be subject to forfeiture as provided by the act of July 8, 1978 (P.L.752, No.140), known as the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act, and by or pursuant to section 16(b) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. Forfeitures under this subsection or under any other provision of law may not be applied to increase the benefits that any member would otherwise receive under this part. (ii) In accordance with section 16(b) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and notwithstanding this paragraph, the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act, or 42 Pa.C.S. § 3352 (relating to pension rights), the accumulated mandatory participant contributions and accumulated voluntary contributions standing to the credit of a participant shall not be forfeited but shall be available for payment of fines and restitution as provided by law. In accordance with section 16(b) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, amounts in the trust that have been ordered to be distributed to an alternate payee as the result of an equitable distribution of marital property as part of an approved domestic relations order entered before the date of the order or action in a court or other tribunal resulting in a forfeiture of a participant's interest in the trust shall not be subject to the provisions of the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act or 42 Pa.C.S. § 3352. Any accumulated employer defined contributions forfeited as a result of this paragraph or other law shall be retained by the board and notwithstanding sections 5812(2) (relating to powers and duties of board), 5815 (relating to expenses) and 5902(c) (relating to administrative duties of the board) used for the payment of administrative fees, costs and expenses of the plan. (3) Rights under this part shall be subject to attachment in favor of an alternate payee as set forth in an approved domestic relations order. (4) Effective with distributions made on or after January 1, 1993, and notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan by way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this paragraph, a \"distributee\" includes a member, a participant, a member's surviving spouse, a participant's surviving spouse, a member's former spouse who is an alternate payee under an approved domestic relations order, a participant's former spouse who is an alternate payee under an approved domestic relations order and anyone else authorized under the IRC and the plan terms approved by the board to have an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan by way of a direct rollover. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"eligible rollover distribution\" has the meaning given such term by IRC § 402(f)(2)(A), and \"eligible retirement plan\" has the meaning given such term by IRC § 402(c)(8)(B), except that a qualified trust shall be considered an eligible retirement plan only if it accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution; however, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an \"individual retirement account\" or an \"individual retirement annuity\" as those terms are defined in IRC § 408(a) and (b). (b) Authorized payments from fund and trust.-- (1) The board shall be authorized to pay from the fund and the trust in the case of a member or participant who is terminating service, the amount determined after certification by the head of the department that the member or participant is so obligated, and after review and approval by the department or agency's legal representative or upon receipt of an assignment from the member or participant in the amount so certified, except that no payment shall be made from the individual investment account of a participant until the participant otherwise applies for and receives a distribution and shall not exceed the amount of the distribution. (2) In the case of a participant whose former spouse is an alternate payee of an equitable distribution of marital assets under an approved domestic relations order, a lump sum of the alternate payee's interest in the participant's vested accumulated total defined contributions. This paragraph shall apply without regard to whether the participant has not terminated, is terminating or has terminated State service.

If a member elects to receive this previous State service credit, The Pennsylvania State University shall make employer contributions equal to the amount that would have been contributed had employer contributions been made to the system concurrently with the rendering of the service, plus valuation interest to the day of the crediting of the service. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the amount due as member contributions and interest for an employee who is employed by the Applied Research Laboratory on June 3, 1984, who elects to purchase this credit with the State Employees' Retirement System shall not exceed the amount of contributions and interest certified as having been made to the pension plan administered by the Applied Research Laboratory during his employment with the Applied Research Laboratory.

The additional contributions paid by The Pennsylvania State University shall not be considered compensation for purposes of this part. (d) Transfer of certain pension service credit.-- (1) Any person who was an employee of any county in this Commonwealth on the personal staff of an appellate court judge prior to September 9, 1985, and who had that employment transferred to the Commonwealth pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 3703 (relating to local chamber facilities) shall be a member of the system for all service rendered as an employee of the Commonwealth on the personal staff of an appellate court judge subsequent to the date of the transfer unless specifically prohibited pursuant to section 5301(c) (relating to mandatory and optional membership in the system and participation in the plan). The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service credit in that county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous county employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer, by the member, county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's county or municipal pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the county or municipal pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by December 31, 1987, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by December 31, 1987. If the amount transferred to the system by the member of a county or municipal pension plan or retirement system is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service in accordance with county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system benefit provisions, multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members. The Public Employee Retirement Study Commission shall determine the appropriate amount of employer contributions to be transferred to the system by the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems. (2) If the member died prior to the effective date of this subsection, the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1). In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by December 31, 1987. If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before January 1, 1988, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by March 31, 1988. If the member dies after December 31, 1987, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), neither the member or his estate shall receive credit for the prior service. (e) Transfer and purchase of certain pension service credit; Philadelphia Regional Port Authority.-- (1) Any employee of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority who becomes a State employee, as defined in section 5102 (relating to definitions), and an active member of the system shall be eligible to obtain retirement credit for prior uncredited service with the Philadelphia Port Corporation, a Pennsylvania not-for-profit corporation (\"predecessor corporation\"), provided that the Commonwealth does not incur any liability for the funding of the annuities attributable to the prior, uncredited \"predecessor corporation\" service, the cost of which shall be determined according to paragraph (2). (2) The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service in the \"predecessor corporation\" transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, the provisions of section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer by the member or the \"predecessor corporation\" to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the member's pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by June 30, 1992, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the \"predecessor corporation\" pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by June 30, 1992. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall pay as pick-up contributions the difference between the amount credited to the member's account and the amount otherwise due under section 5504. Such additional contributions paid by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall not be considered compensation for the purposes of this part. If the amount transferred to the system by the member is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members so long as the amount to be transferred is equal to or less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee. In the event that the amount required to be transferred is greater than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee shall be transferred to the system, and the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system the additional funds needed to satisfy the requirements of the calculation in this paragraph. If the amount required to be transferred is less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority may retain the amount not needed for transfer. (3) If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before July 1, 1992, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or may request that the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by September 30, 1992. If the member dies after June 30, 1992, without making the transfer or without requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), neither the member nor his estate shall receive credit for the prior service. (4) Any person who became employed by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority between July 10, 1989, and passage of this act and who becomes a State employee, as defined in section 5102, and an active member of the system shall be eligible to obtain retirement credit for service from the date of employment with the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, provided that the contributions are made in accordance with sections 5501, 5504, 5505.1 and 5506. (f) Transfer of certain pension service credit; Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network.-- (1) An active member who is an employee of the Office of Attorney General and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network on December 31, 1992, shall be eligible to obtain State service credit for service with the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network for the period December 1, 1988, to July 31, 1991, upon payment of the required contributions by the member and Office of Attorney General and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network if the provisions of this subsection are satisfied. (2) The employee shall elect to receive the credit by filing an application with the board while an active member no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act. (3) Contributions to be paid by an active member for credit for New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be sufficient to provide an amount equal to the regular and additional accumulated deductions which would have been standing to the credit of the member for such service had regular and additional member contributions been made to the board with full coverage as a Class A member during the period of New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and had these regular and additional accumulated deductions been credited with statutory interest up to the date of purchase. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account. The amount of members' contributions so determined by the board shall be the obligation of the member who requested credit for New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and in no event shall such amount be an obligation of the Office of Attorney General and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network or the State of New Jersey Retirement System.

Contributions paid by the Office of Attorney General shall be made out of Regional Information Sharing Systems Program grants and Federal funds received from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, United States Department of Justice, and in no event shall the contributions be the obligation of any other fund of the Commonwealth. The contributions shall not be considered compensation for purposes of this part. The full actuarial cost of the increased benefit attributable to the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be the difference between subparagraphs (i) and (ii) less the member's contribution: (i) the present value of a standard single life annuity, beginning at the earliest possible superannuation age, calculated assuming a 6.5% future salary increase, a 9% interest rate and standard postretirement mortality, assuming credit for the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service to be purchased; and (ii) the present value of a standard single life annuity, beginning at the earliest possible superannuation age, calculated assuming a 6.5% future salary increase, a 9% interest rate, standard postretirement mortality, excluding credit for the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service to be purchased. (5) The earliest possible superannuation age shall be the age at which the member becomes first eligible for superannuation retirement assuming continued full-time service and credit for the amount of service which the member has elected to purchase or the current attained age of the member, whichever is later. (6) The payment shall be made in lump sum by either the Office of Attorney General or the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network within 90 days of certification by the board of the required contribution amount and shall be credited to the State accumulation account.

(8) In no event shall New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service be creditable if the member has received, is entitled to receive, eligible to receive now or in the future or is receiving retirement benefits for such service or has retirement credit or has now or acquires in the future retirement credit under a retirement system administered and wholly or partially paid for by any other governmental agency or by any private employer or a retirement program approved by the employer in accordance with section 5301(a)(12). In the event that State service credit is granted for New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and the member subsequently receives credit for such service that is prohibited by this paragraph, the State service credited shall be canceled and any member contributions made pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be refunded to the member. (9) In the event the member is or was an annuitant, any annuity paid or payable during the period of such service with the New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network shall be canceled retroactive to the date the member began service with the New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network, any such annuity payments made to the member shall be repaid by the member, and the provisions of section 5706 (relating to termination of annuities) shall apply if applicable. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account. The amount of annuity repayments so determined by the board shall be the obligation of the member who requested credit for New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service, and in no event shall such amount be an obligation of the Office of Attorney General and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network.

Additionally, all creditable State service and nonstate service reinstated or purchased while an employee of the Juvenile Court Judges' Commission shall be canceled.

(a) General rule.-- County employees who are transferred to State employment pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 1905 (relating to county-level court administrators) may elect to convert their county service in the retirement system or pension plan in which they were contributors immediately prior to the transfer to State employment. (b) Time for making election.-- The election to convert county service to State service must be made by filing written notice with the board within 90 days after the transfer to State employment. An election to convert service shall be effective when filed with the board but shall not be effective before the date of transfer to State employment. An election to convert county service to State service shall be irrevocable. (c) Effect of failure to make election.-- Failure to elect to convert county service to State service within the election period set forth in subsection (b) shall result in the county service not being converted to State service. Transferred employees who do not elect to convert county service to State service shall not have the opportunity to make a subsequent conversion election should they later obtain different employment in the unified judicial system or other State employment eligible for membership in the system. (d) Effect of election.-- An election to convert county service to State service shall convert all county service in the retirement system or pension plan in which the transferred employee was a member immediately before the transfer to State employment, even if not performed as a judicial system employee of the county. The election shall not convert service in other retirement systems or pension plans that is not credited in the county plan from which the member is transferred.

(a) General rule.-- (1) An action in tort alleging a wrong done by a declarant or his agent or employee in connection with a portion of any convertible or withdrawable real estate or other portion of the planned community which the declarant has the responsibility to maintain may not be brought against the association or against a unit owner other than a declarant. (2) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (1): (i) An action in tort alleging a wrong done by the association or by an agent or employee of the association, or on behalf of the association, must be brought against the association. (ii) A unit owner shall not be subject to suit or, except as otherwise provided by subsection (b), be otherwise directly or indirectly held accountable for the acts of the association or its agents or employees on behalf of the association. (3) If the tort or breach of contract occurred during any period of declarant control under section 5303(c) (relating to executive board members and officers), the declarant is liable to the association for all unreimbursed losses suffered by the association as a result of that tort or breach of contract, including costs and reasonable attorney fees. If a claim for a tort or breach of contract is made after the period of declarant control, the association shall have no right against the declarant under this paragraph unless the association shall have given the declarant all of the following: (i) Notice of the existence of the claim promptly after the date on which a member of the executive board who is not a designee of the declarant learns of the existence of the claim. (ii) An opportunity to defend against the claim on behalf of the association but at the declarant's expense. (4) A unit owner is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this subsection because he is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association. Any statute of limitation affecting the association's right of action under this section is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates. (b) Lien of judgment.-- Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a judgment for money against the association if and when entered of record against the name of the association in the office of the clerk of the court of common pleas of the county where the planned community is located shall also constitute a lien against each unit for a pro rata share of the amount of that judgment, including interest thereon, based on the common expense liability allocated to that unit under section 5208 (relating to allocation of votes and common expense liabilities). No other property of a unit owner is subject to the claims of creditors of the association. (c) Indexing judgment.-- A judgment against the association must be indexed in the name of the planned community. (d) Applicability of section.-- The provisions of this section shall apply to all associations without regard to whether the association is organized as a corporation or as an unincorporated association.

The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall consist of the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b), and the accrued liability contribution rate as defined in subsection (c). The actuarially required contribution rate on behalf of all active members shall be modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in subsection (f). (b) Employer normal contribution rate.-- The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined after each actuarial valuation on the basis of an annual interest rate and such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the board in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. The employer normal contribution rate shall be determined as follows: (1) From the effective date of this paragraph through fiscal year 2021-2022, as a level percentage of the compensation of the average new active member, which percentage, if contributed on the basis of his prospective compensation through his entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to him in excess of that portion funded by his prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (2) For fiscal year 2022-2023 and each fiscal year thereafter, as a level percentage of the compensation of all active members, which percentage, if contributed from the start of their employment on the basis of their prospective compensation through their entire period of active State service, would be sufficient to fund the liability for any prospective benefit payable to them in excess of that portion funded by their prospective member contributions, excluding shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions. In no case shall the employer normal contribution rate in the aggregate or for each class of service separately be less than zero. (c) Accrued liability contribution rate.-- (1) For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2003, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits, except for the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708 (relating to supplemental annuities), 5708.1 (relating to additional supplemental annuities), 5708.2 (relating to further additional supplemental annuities), 5708.3 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1994), 5708.4 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment), 5708.5 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 1998), 5708.6 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2002), 5708.7 (relating to supplemental annuities commencing 2003) and 5708.8 (relating to special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002), in excess of the total assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all investment gains and losses over a five-year period), excluding the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members on December 31, 2001, and excluding contributions to be transferred by county retirement systems or pension plans pursuant to section 5507(c) (relating to contributions to the system by the Commonwealth and other employers). The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002, except that, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2002, but before July 1, 2003, such additional liability shall be funded over a period of ten years from the first day of July, coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. The amount of each annual accrued liability contribution for such additional legislative liabilities shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the first annual payment. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, the outstanding balance of the increase in accrued liability due to the change in benefits enacted in 2001 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2002, and the outstanding balance of the net actuarial loss incurred in calendar year 2002 shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions over a period that ends 30 years after July 1, 2003. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, and ending June 30, 2010, if the accrued liability is increased by legislation enacted subsequent to June 30, 2003, but before January 1, 2009, such additional liability shall be funded in equal dollar annual contributions over a period of ten years from the first day of July coincident with or next following the effective date of the increase. (3) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as the rate of total compensation of all active members which shall be certified by the actuary as sufficient to fund in equal dollar installments over a period of 30 years from July 1, 2010, the present value of the liabilities for all prospective benefits calculated as of the immediately prior valuation date, including the supplemental benefits as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8, but excluding the benefits payable from the retirement benefit plan established pursuant to section 5941 (relating to benefits completion plan), in excess of the actuarially calculated assets in the fund (calculated recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses each year in level annual installments over five years), including the balance in the supplemental annuity account, and the present value of employer normal contributions determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer will receive for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), and of member contributions payable with respect to all active members, inactive members on leave without pay, vestees and special vestees on December 31, 2009. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (4) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the accrued liability contribution rate shall be computed as provided for under this section, except that the rate shall be computed as a rate of total compensation of all active members and active participants for the applicable period and the accrued liability shall be determined and the rate shall be computed without regard to the portion of any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h) for which an annual setoff has not been credited or recognized in a prior fiscal year. If the accrued liability is changed by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2016, such change in liability shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. In addition to any employer defined contributions made to the trust, the Commonwealth and other employers of participants shall make the accrued liability contributions to the fund certified by the board. (d) Special provisions on calculating contributions.-- In calculating the contributions required by subsections (a), (b) and (c), the active members of Class C shall be considered to be members of Class A. In addition, the actuary shall determine the Commonwealth or other employer contributions required for active members of Class C and officers of the Pennsylvania State Police and enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board who are members of Class A to finance their benefits in excess of those to which other members of Class A are entitled. Such additional contributions shall be determined separately for officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police and for enforcement officers and investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. Such contributions payable on behalf of officers and employees of the Pennsylvania State Police shall include the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of May 12, 1943 (P.L.259, No.120), referred to as the Foreign Casualty Insurance Premium Tax Allocation Law, and on behalf of enforcement officers or investigators of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the amounts received by the system under the provisions of the act of April 12, 1951 (P.L.90, No.21), known as the Liquor Code. (e) Supplemental annuity contribution rate.-- (1) For the period July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4 and 5708.5 shall be paid over a period of ten years from July 1, 2002. The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2002 provided for in section 5708.6 shall be as provided in section 5708.6(f). The funding for the supplemental annuities commencing 2003 provided for in section 5708.7 shall be as provided in section 5708.7(f). The funding for the special supplemental postretirement adjustment of 2002 under section 5708.8 shall be as provided in section 5708.8(g). The amount of each annual supplemental annuities contribution shall be equal to the amount of such contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2002. (2) For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2010, contributions from the Commonwealth and other employers whose employees are members of the system required to provide for the payment of supplemental annuities as provided in sections 5708, 5708.1, 5708.2, 5708.3, 5708.4, 5708.5, 5708.6, 5708.7 and 5708.8 shall be paid as part of the accrued liability contribution rate as provided for in subsection (c)(3), and there shall not be a separate supplemental annuity contribution rate attributable to those supplemental annuities. In the event that supplemental annuities are increased by legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 2009, the additional liability for the increase in benefits shall be funded in equal dollar installments as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of ten years from the first day of July following the valuation date coincident with or next following the date such legislation is enacted. (f) Experience adjustment factor.-- (1) For each fiscal year after the establishment of the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, any increase or decrease in the unfunded accrued liability and any increase or decrease in the liabilities and funding for supplemental annuities, due to actual experience differing from assumed experience (recognizing all realized and unrealized investment gains and losses over a five-year period), changes in contributions caused by the final contribution rate being different from the actuarially required contribution rate, State employees making shared-risk member contributions or having shared-gain adjustments to their regular member contributions, payment of additional accrued liability contributions under section 5507(g), changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in the terms and conditions of the benefits provided by the system by judicial, administrative or other processes other than legislation, including, but not limited to, reinterpretation of the provisions of this part, shall be amortized in equal dollar annual contributions as a percentage of compensation of all active members and active participants over a period of 30 years beginning with the July 1 succeeding the actuarial valuation determining said increases or decreases. The experience adjustment factor calculated under this paragraph shall be determined without regard to any advance payment of accrued liability contributions made by the Commonwealth or any eligible employer under section 5507(h). (2) The actuarially required contribution rate shall be the sum of the normal contribution rate, the accrued liability contribution rate and the supplemental annuity contribution rate, modified by the experience adjustment factor as calculated in paragraph (1). (g) Determination of liability for special vestee.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or other law, the total additional accrued actuarial liability resulting from eligibility of special vestees for benefits upon the attainment of superannuation age shall be determined by the actuary as part of the first annual valuation made after June 30, 1997. The resulting additional accrued actuarial liability shall be paid by The Pennsylvania State University to the board in one lump sum payment within 90 days of the board's certification of the amount to The Pennsylvania State University. (h) Temporary application of collared contribution rate.-- The collared contribution rate for each fiscal year shall be determined by comparing the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation to the prior year's final contribution rate. If, for any of the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2011, July 1, 2012, and on or after July 1, 2013, the actuarially required contribution rate calculated without regard for costs added by legislation is more than 3%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, of the total compensation of all active members greater than the prior year's final contribution rate, then the collared contribution rate shall be applied and be equal to the prior year's final contribution rate increased by the respective percentage above of total compensation of all active members. Otherwise, and for all subsequent fiscal years, the collared contribution rate shall not apply. In no case shall the collared contribution rate be less than 4% of total compensation of all active members. (i) Final contribution rate.-- For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010, the final contribution rate shall be 5% of total compensation of all active members. For each subsequent fiscal year for which the collared contribution rate is applicable, the final contribution rate shall be the collared contribution rate plus the costs added by legislation. For all other fiscal years, the final contribution rate shall be the actuarially required contribution rate, provided that the final contribution rate shall not be less than the employer normal contribution rate, as defined in subsection (b).

(a) Amount of annuity.-- A member who has made application for a disability annuity and has been found to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of section 5905(c)(1) (relating to duties of the board regarding applications and elections of members and participants) shall receive a disability annuity payable from the effective date of disability as determined by the board and continued until a subsequent determination by the board that the annuitant is no longer entitled to a disability annuity. If the sum of the products of the number of years and fractional part of a year of credited service in each class and the appropriate class of service multiplier is greater than 16.667, the disability annuity shall be a single life annuity that is equal to the sum of the standard single life annuities determined separately for each class of service multiplied by the appropriate class of service multiplier, otherwise each standard single life annuity shall be multiplied by the lesser of the following ratios: MY*/Y or 16.667/Y Where Y = total number of years of credited service; Y* = total years of credited service if the member were to continue as a State employee until attaining superannuation age as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, or if the member has attained superannuation age, as applicable to that class of service at the time of disability, then the number of years of credited service and M = the class of service multiplier as applicable to that class of service at the effective date of disability. A member of Class C shall receive, in addition, any annuity to which he may be eligible under section 5702(a)(3) (relating to maximum single life annuity). The member shall be entitled to the election of a joint and survivor annuity on that portion of the disability annuity to which he is entitled under section 5702. (b) Benefit attributable to social security integration credit.-- If the member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and has social security integration credits as provided in section 5305 (relating to social security integration credits), he may elect to withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions or if he has five or more eligibility points to his credit and does not withdraw his social security integration accumulated deductions he may execute an application to be filed with the board to receive, in addition to his disability annuity, an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702(a)(2). (c) Reduction on account of earned income.-- Subsequent to January 1, 1972, payments on account of disability shall be reduced by that amount by which the earned income of the annuitant, as reported in accordance with section 5908(b) (relating to rights and duties of annuitants), for the preceding calendar year together with the disability annuity payments provided in this section other than subsection (b), for the year, exceeds the product of: (1) the last year's salary of the annuitant as a member of the system; and (2) the ratio of the current monthly payment to the monthly payment at the effective date of disability; Provided, That the annuitant shall not receive less than his member's annuity or the amount to which he may be entitled under section 5702 whichever is greater. (d) Reduction on account of ineligibility.-- Payment of that portion of the disability annuity in excess of the annuity to which the annuitant was entitled at the effective date of disability calculated in accordance with section 5702 shall cease if the annuitant is no longer eligible under the provisions of sections 5905(c)(2) or 5908(b) or (c). (e) Termination of State service.-- Upon termination of disability annuity payments in excess of an annuity calculated in accordance with section 5702, a disability annuitant who does not return to State service may file an application with the board for an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of the shared-risk accumulated deductions plus the regular and additional accumulated deductions standing to his credit at the effective date of disability over one-third of the total disability annuity payments received. If the annuitant on the date of termination of service was eligible for an annuity as provided in section 5308(a) or (b) (relating to eligibility for annuities), he may file an application with the board for an election of an optional modification of his annuity.

(f) Supplement for service connected disability.-- (1) If a member has been found to be eligible for a disability annuity and if the disability has been found to be a service connected disability and if the member is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits, such member shall receive a supplement equal to the amount determined under paragraph (2) less the sum of the annuity as determined under subsection (a) and any payments paid or payable on account of such disability under the act of June 2, 1915 (P.L.736, No.338), known as the Workers' Compensation Act, the act of June 21, 1939 (P.L.566, No.284), known as The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act, and the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.). Such supplement shall continue as long as he is determined to be disabled and is receiving workers' compensation payments for other than medical benefits on account of his service connected disability in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act or The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act. If the member has received a lump sum workers' compensation payment in lieu of future weekly compensation payments, the length in weeks and calculation of the service connected disability supplement shall be determined by dividing the lump sum payment by the average weekly wage as determined by the Workers' Compensation Board. (2) For a member who does not have Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be 70% of the member's final average salary. For a member who has Class A-5 or Class A-6 service, the amount to be used to determine eligibility for the supplement under paragraph (1) shall be calculated according to the following formula: A = .7[(Y W MULTIPLIED BY FAS W )+(Y P MULTIPLIED BY FAS P )] Y T Y T (3) The following apply to the formula in paragraph (2): (i) A equals the amount used to determine the supplement; (ii) Y T equals total years of credited service; (iii) Y W equals years of credited service that are not Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (iv) FAS W equals final average salary calculated for credited service other than Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; (v) Y P equals years of service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service; and (vi) FAS P equals final average salary calculated for service credited as Class A-5 or Class A-6 service. (g) Limitation regarding annual benefit under IRC § 415.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this part to the contrary, no benefit shall be payable to the extent that such benefit exceeds any limitation under IRC § 415 as in effect with respect to governmental plans as such term is defined in IRC § 414(d) on the date the benefit payment becomes effective, provided however, that any increase in any limitation under IRC § 415 shall be applicable to all current and future annuitants and survivor annuitants.

(2) This subsection shall not apply in the case of any annuitant who: (i) may render services to the Commonwealth in the capacity of an independent contractor; or (ii) is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year and who may render service to the Commonwealth: (A) as a member of an independent board or commission or as a member of a departmental administrative or advisory board or commission when such members of independent or departmental boards or commissions are compensated on a per diem basis for not more than 150 days per calendar year; or (B) as a member of an independent board or commission requiring appointment by the Governor, with advice and consent of the Senate, where the annual salary payable to the member does not exceed $35,000 and where the member has been an annuitant for at least six months immediately preceding the appointment. (a.1) Return to State service during emergency.-- When, in the judgment of the employer, an emergency creates an increase in the work load such that there is serious impairment of service to the public, an annuitant who is over normal retirement age or who has been an annuitant for more than one year may be returned to State service for a period not to exceed 95 days in any calendar year without loss of his annuity. In computing the number of days an annuitant has returned to State service, any amount of time less than one-half of a day shall be counted as one-half of a day. For agencies, boards and commissions under the Governor's jurisdiction, the approval of the Governor that an emergency exists shall be required before an annuitant may be returned to State service. (a.2) Return of benefits.-- In the event an annuitant whose annuity from the system ceases pursuant to this section receives any annuity payment, including a lump sum payment pursuant to section 5705 (relating to member's options) on or after the date of his return to State service or entering school service, the annuitant shall return to the board the amount so received from the system plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member or school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions to the system in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board. The salary deduction amortization plans agreed to by the member and the board may include a deferral of payment amounts and statutory interest until the termination of school service or State service as the board in its sole discretion decides to allow. The board may limit salary deduction amortization plans to such terms as the board in its sole discretion determines. In the case of a school employee who is an active member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System, the agreed upon salary deductions shall be remitted to the Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which shall certify and transfer to the board the amounts paid. (a.3) Return of benefits paid during USERRA leave.-- In the event that a former State employee is reemployed from USERRA leave who had received any payments or annuity from the system during the USERRA leave, the employee shall return to the board the amount so received plus statutory interest. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or in the case of an active member may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board, but not longer than a period that starts with the date of reemployment and continuing for up to three times the length of the member's immediate past period of USERRA leave, with the repayment period not to exceed five years or such longer time as may be agreed to between the board and the member. (a.4) Return to service as a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of the act of September 30, 1983 (P.L.160, No.39), known as the Public Official Compensation Law, 42 Pa.C.S. (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure) or any other provision of law or rule of court providing for or allowing a member of the judiciary to return to service as a senior judge, senior justice, senior magisterial district judge or in any administrative, fact finding, adjudicative, appellate or other capacity with any court or tribunal or in any other capacity for which compensation is received and to receive such compensation, whether paid on a per diem, hourly, salaried or other basis, in addition to any annuity payable under this part, any such member of the judiciary who returns to State service shall be subject to the provision of this section and section 5301 (relating to mandatory and optional membership) unless that member of the judiciary is over normal retirement age or has been an annuitant for more than one year. (a.5) No contributions or credited service.-- The service of an annuitant whose annuity does not cease upon his return to State or school service shall not be subject to member contributions or eligible for qualification as creditable State service and shall not be eligible for participation in the plan, mandatory pickup participant contributions, voluntary contributions or employer defined contributions. (b) Subsequent discontinuance of service.-- Upon subsequent discontinuance of service, such terminating State employee other than a former annuitant who had the effect of his frozen present value eliminated in accordance with subsection (c) or a former disability annuitant shall be entitled to an annuity which is actuarially equivalent to the present value as determined under subsection (a) to which shall be added, if the service after reemployment was as a member of the system, the present value of a maximum single life annuity based on years of service credited subsequent to reentry in the system and his final average salary computed by reference to his compensation as a member of the system or as a member of the Public School Employees' Retirement System during his entire period of State and school service. (c) Elimination of the effect of frozen present value.-- (1) An annuitant who returns to State service as an active member of the system and earns three eligibility points as a member of the system by performing credited State service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, or an annuitant who enters school service other than as a Class DC participant and: (i) is a multiple service member; or (ii) who elects multiple service membership, and earns three eligibility points by performing credited State service as a member of the system or credited school service following the most recent period of receipt of an annuity under this part, and who had the present value of his annuity frozen in accordance with subsection (a), shall qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value resulting from all previous periods of retirement eliminated, provided that all lump sum payments under Option 4 or under section 5705(a.1) and annuity payments payable during previous periods of retirement plus interest as set forth in paragraph (3) shall be returned to the fund in the form of an actuarial adjustment to his subsequent benefits or in such form as the board may otherwise direct. (2) Upon subsequent discontinuance of service and the filing of an application for an annuity, a former annuitant who qualifies to have the effect of a frozen present value eliminated under this subsection shall be entitled to receive the higher of either: (i) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the freezing of the former annuitant's account pursuant to subsection (a) had not occurred, adjusted by crediting Class A State service as Class AA service as provided for in section 5306(a.1) (relating to classes of service) and further adjusted according to paragraph (3), provided that a former annuitant of the system or a former annuitant of the Public School Employees' Retirement System who retired under a provision of law granting additional service credit if termination of State or school service or retirement occurred during a specific period of time shall not be permitted to retain the additional service credit under the prior law when the annuity is computed for his most recent retirement; or (ii) an annuity (prior to optional modification) calculated as if the former annuitant did not qualify to have the effect of the frozen present value eliminated, unless the former annuitant notifies the board in writing by the later of the date the application for annuity is filed or the effective date of retirement that the former annuitant wishes to receive the lower annuity. (3) In addition to any other adjustment to the present value of the maximum single life annuity that a member may be entitled to receive that occurs as a result of any other provision of law, the present value of the maximum single life annuity shall be reduced by all amounts paid or payable to him during all previous periods of retirement plus interest on these amounts until the date of subsequent retirement. The interest for each year shall be calculated based upon the annual interest rate adopted for that fiscal year by the board for the calculation of the normal contribution rate pursuant to section 5508(b) (relating to actuarial cost method).

(2) Requires the system to provide no more than the total amount of benefits than the member would otherwise receive (determined on the basis of actuarial value) unless increased benefits are paid to the member or alternate payee based upon cost-of-living increases or increases based on other than actuarial value. (3) Specifies the amount or percentage of the member's benefits to be paid by the system to each such alternate payee or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined. (4) Specifies the retirement option to be selected by the member upon retirement or states that the member may select any retirement option offered by this part upon retirement.

(a.1) Certification regarding participants.-- A domestic relations order pertaining to a participant shall be certified as an approved domestic relations order by the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, only if the order meets all of the following: (1) Does not require the plan to provide a type or form of benefit or an option applicable to members of the system or participants in the plan. (2) Does not require the segregation of the alternate payee's share of the participant's individual investment account into a subaccount or newly established individual account titled in the name of the alternate payee. (3) Does not require the plan to recover or distribute any funds that were distributed to the participant or at the participant's direction prior to the approval of the domestic relations order by the secretary of the board or his designated representative. (4) Requires the plan to pay to the alternate payee no more than the lesser of the vested amount of the participant's individual investment account specified by the domestic relations order or the vested amount of the participant's individual investment account as of the date of the transfer of the alternate payee's share to the alternate payee. (5) States that the plan shall not be required to recoup or make good for losses in value to the participant's individual investment account incurred between the date of the valuation of the account used for equitable distribution purposes and the date of distribution to the alternate payee. (6) Specifies the amount or percentage of the participant's individual investment account to be paid to the alternate payee and the date upon which the valuation is based.

(8) Does not grant an alternate payee the rights, privileges or options available to a participant. (9) Requires the participant to execute an authorization allowing each alternate payee to monitor the participant's compliance with the terms of the domestic relations order through access to information concerning the participant maintained by the plan. An authorization granted under this section shall be construed as an authorization for the alternate payee to receive information concerning the participant that relates to the administration, calculation and payment of the alternate payee's share of the participant's account and not as an authorization to exercise the rights afforded to participants or obtain information that is not related to the administration, calculation and payment of the alternate payee's share of the participant's individual investment account. (10) Requires the immediate distribution of the alternate payee's share of the participant's individual investment account, which may be made by direct payment, eligible rollover or trustee-to-trustee transfer to another eligible plan or qualified account owned by the alternate payee. (11) In the case of a participant who is currently receiving distributions from the plan as of the date the domestic relations order is approved by the secretary of the board or his designated representative, may not order the board to pay the alternate payee more than the vested balance available in the participant's individual investment account as of the date the order is approved or require that distributions continue to the alternate payee after the death of the participant and final settlement of the participant's individual investment account. (b) Determination by secretary.-- Within a reasonable period after receipt of a domestic relations order, the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, shall determine whether the order is an approved domestic relations order and notify the member or participant and each alternate payee of this determination. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the exclusive remedy of any member, participant or alternate payee aggrieved by a decision of the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, shall be the right to an adjudication by the board under 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 Subch. A (relating to practice and procedure) with appeal therefrom to the Commonwealth Court under 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 7 (relating to judicial review) and 42 Pa.C.S. § 763(a)(1) (relating to direct appeals from government agencies). (c) Other orders.-- The requirements for approval identified in subsections (a) and (a.1) shall not apply to any domestic relations order which is an order for support as the term is defined at 23 Pa.C.S. § 4302 (relating to definitions) or an order for the enforcement of arrearages as provided in 23 Pa.C.S. § 3703 (relating to enforcement of arrearages). These orders shall be approved to the extent that they do not attach moneys in excess of the limits on attachments as established by the laws of the United States and this Commonwealth, require distributions of benefits in a manner that would violate the laws of the United States, any other state or this Commonwealth or require the distribution of funds for support or enforcement of arrearages against a participant who is not receiving distributions from the plan at the time the order is entered. These orders may be approved notwithstanding any other provision of this part or the plan that would require a distribution of accumulated employer defined contributions in the form of an annuity or to require the purchase of an annuity. (d) Obligation discharged.-- Only the requirements of this part and any regulations promulgated hereunder shall be used to govern the approval or disapproval of a domestic relations order. Therefore, if the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, acts in accordance with the provisions of this part and any promulgated regulations in approving or disapproving a domestic relations order, then the obligations of the system or the plan with respect to such approval or disapproval shall be discharged.

(a) Exclusive source of rights and benefits.-- Regardless of any other provision of law, pension and benefit rights of State employees shall be determined solely by this part or any amendment thereto or the plan document established by the board; and no collective bargaining agreement nor any arbitration award between the Commonwealth and other employers and the Commonwealth's and other employer's employees or their collective bargaining representatives shall be construed to change any of the provisions herein, to require the board to administer pension or retirement benefits not set forth in this part or not established by the board in the plan document, to require the board to modify, amend or change any of the terms and provisions of the plan document, or to otherwise require action by any other government body pertaining to pension or retirement benefits or rights of State employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any pension or retirement benefits or rights previously so established by or as a result of an arbitration award shall remain in effect after the expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement between the State employees so affected and the Commonwealth until the expiration of each of the collective bargaining agreements in effect on January 1, 2011, at which time the classes of membership and resulting member contribution rates and contributions for creditable nonstate service, eligibility for vesting, withdrawal and superannuation annuities, optional modification of annuities and other terms and conditions related to class of membership shall be as determined by this part for employees covered by those and successor collective bargaining agreements. For purposes of administering this part, for those State employees who are members of each such collective bargaining unit, the date January 1, 2011, contained in this part, except in this section, shall be replaced with the date of the day immediately following the expiration of each such collective bargaining agreement. The provisions of this part insofar as they are the same as those of existing law are intended as a continuation of such laws and not as new enactments. The provisions of this part shall not affect any act done, liability incurred, right accrued or vested, or any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted to enforce any right or penalty or to punish any offense under the authority of any repealed laws. (b) (Reserved). (c) Officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police.-- (1) Notwithstanding a provision of subsection (a) or section 12.1 of the act of November 23, 2010 (P.L.1269, No.120), regarding the continued effectiveness of pension or retirement benefits or rights previously established by or as a result of a binding arbitration award issued before July 1, 1989, under the act of June 24, 1968 (P.L.237, No.111), referred to as the Policemen and Firemen Collective Bargaining Act, and implemented by the board, the eligibility for and calculation of pension or retirement benefits or rights under the binding arbitration award of a State employee who first becomes a State police officer on or after January 1, 2019, and before the effective date of section 5306.6 (relating to election to purchase nonintervening military service) who does not make the election under section 5306.6, shall be determined using only service performed and compensation and eligibility points earned as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police or while on USERRA leave from service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police and provided that service credit and eligibility points for service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police shall be adjusted for any other concurrent service as a State employee. (2) Any service other than service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police performed by a State employee eligible for a benefit under the binding arbitration under paragraph (1) shall be used to determine benefits as provided in this part in addition to any benefit an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police is eligible to receive under the binding arbitration award as set forth in this subsection. (3) The following shall apply: (i) The eligibility for and calculation of pension or retirement benefits or rights under the binding arbitration award of a State employee who first becomes a State police officer on or after January 1, 2019, and before the effective date of section 5306.6 and who makes the election under section 5306.6, or who first becomes a State police officer on or after the effective date of section 5306.6, shall be determined using only service performed and compensation and eligibility points earned: (A) as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police; (B) while on USERRA leave from service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police; or (C) from creditable nonstate service purchased under section 5304(c)(2) (relating to creditable nonstate service) while an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police. (ii) Service credit and eligibility points for service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police shall be adjusted for any other concurrent service as a State employee. (iii) Any service, other than the following, purchased or performed by a State employee eligible for a benefit under the binding arbitration award shall be used to determine benefits as provided under this part in addition to any benefit an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police is eligible to receive under the binding arbitration award as provided under this subsection: (A) Creditable nonstate service purchased under section 5304(c)(2) while an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police. (B) Service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police. (4) A State employee who meets either of the following and who terminates State service on or after January 1, 2019, shall be eligible to receive a maximum single life annuity before optional modification under section 5705 (relating to member's options) equal to the maximum single life annuity that the State employee is eligible to receive under this part attributable to all credited service, compensation and eligibility points: (i) First becomes a State police officer on or after January 1, 2019, and before the effective date of section 5306.6 and who did not make the election under section 5306.6 who does not have 20 or more eligibility points as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police or from USERRA leave from service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police. (ii) First becomes a State police officer on or after January 1, 2019, and who made the election under section 5306.6, or who first becomes a State police officer on or after the effective date of section 5306.6 who does not have 20 or more eligibility points as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police or from USERRA leave from service as an officer or member of the Pennsylvania State Police or from creditable nonstate service purchased under section 5304(c)(2). (5) Except as otherwise provided under this part, service as a State police officer credited in the system shall not operate to prevent any State employee from being a participant in the plan for any State service that is not service as a Class A-5 exempt employee that would otherwise result in participation in the plan. Any benefit resulting from participation in the plan shall be in addition to any benefit a State police officer may be eligible to receive as a member of the system. (6) As used in this subsection, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this paragraph unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Binding arbitration award.\" A binding arbitration award issued before July 1, 1989, under the Policemen and Firemen Collective Bargaining Act, and implemented by the board. (7) For the determination of the entire annuity under this subsection and any applicable binding arbitration award, any salary or compensation for service as a Class A-5 exempt employee by a State employee who first became a member of the system on or after January 1, 2019, shall not include remuneration received in any pay period for voluntary overtime service or duty that exceeds 10% of the State employee's base salary or wages in that pay period. (d) Adverse inference.-- Nothing in this part shall be construed to mean that the limitations on benefits or other requirements under IRC § 401(a) or other applicable provisions of the IRC which are applicable to participants in the plan do not apply to the participants or to members of the system and the benefits payable under this part.

(a) General.-- Shared-risk member contributions shall be made to the fund on behalf of each member of Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 or Class A-6 for current service credited in each such class of service as provided under this section, except for any period of current service in which the making of the contributions has ceased solely by reason of any provision of this part relating to the limitations under IRC § 401(a)(17) or 415. Shared-risk member contributions shall be credited to the members' savings account. A shared-gain adjustment to regular member contributions for Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-6 shall be made as provided under this section. (a.1) Exception for certain members who elected under section 5306.5.-- Notwithstanding subsection (a), shared-risk member contributions and shared-gain adjustments to regular member contributions for Class A-5 and Class A-6 service shall not be made for any member who elected Class A-5 or Class A-6 membership under section 5306.5 (relating to election by active members to become a Class A-5 member, Class A-6 member or plan participant) who were members of a class of service other than Class A-3 or Class A-4 before making the election. (b) Determination of shared-risk contribution rate for Class A-3 and Class A-4 service.-- The shared-risk contribution for Class A-3 and Class A-4 service shall be determined as follows: (1) For the period from the effective date of this section until June 30, 2014, the shared-risk contribution rate for Class A-3 and Class A-4 shall be zero. (2) For the period from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2017, if the annual interest rate adopted by the board for use during the period from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, for the calculation of the normal contribution rate is more than 1% greater than the actual rate of return, net of fees, of the investments of the fund based on market value over the period, the shared-risk contribution rate shall be .5%. In all other situations, the shared-risk contribution rate shall be zero. (3) For each subsequent three-year period, if the shared-gain adjustment to regular member contributions is zero, the shared-risk contribution rate shall be increased by .5% if the annual interest rate adopted by the board for use during the previous ten-year period for the calculation of the normal contribution rate is more than 1% greater than the actual rate of return, net of fees, of the investments of the fund based on market value over the period. The shared-risk contribution rate shall be decreased by .5% if the annual interest rate adopted by the board for use during the previous ten-year period for the calculation of the normal contribution rate is equal to or less than the actual rate of return, net of fees, of the investments of the fund based on market value over that period. (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), the shared-risk contribution rate shall not be less than zero and shall not be more than the experience adjustment factor resulting from investment gains or losses during the determination period in effect on the first day when the new rate would be applied, determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer receives for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h) (relating to contributions to the system by the Commonwealth and other employers), and expressed as a percentage of member compensation, and shall not be more than 2%. For the determination of the shared-risk contribution rate to be effective July 1, 2017, the determination period shall be January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2016. For the determination of the shared-risk contribution rate to be effective July 1, 2020, the determination period shall be January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2019. (5) The shared-risk contribution rate and the factors entering into its calculation shall be certified by the actuary as part of the annual valuations and the actuarial investigation and evaluation of the system conducted every five years under section 5902(j) (relating to administrative duties of the board). (6) In the event that the annual interest rate adopted by the board for the calculation is changed during the period used to determine the shared-risk contribution rate, the board, with the advice of the actuary, shall determine the applicable rate during the entire period, expressed as an annual rate. (7) For any fiscal year in which the actual contributions, plus any annual setoff for that fiscal year resulting from advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), by the Commonwealth or an employer are lower than the actuarially required contributions, the prospective shared-risk contribution rate for those employees whose employers are not making the actuarially required contributions shall be zero and shall not subsequently be increased, except as otherwise provided in this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the actuarially required contribution shall be no less than the normal cost plus the cost to fully amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability calculated using actuarial methods and assumptions that are consistent with generally accepted actuarial standards and generally accepted accounting principles, including professional actuarial standards of practice. (8) If the actuary certifies that the accrued liability contributions calculated in accordance with the actuarial cost method provided in section 5508(b) (relating to actuarial cost method) and without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer receives for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), as adjusted by the experience adjustment factor, are zero or less, then the shared-risk contribution rate for the next fiscal year shall be zero and shall not subsequently be increased, except as otherwise provided in this section. (9) The shared-risk contribution rate for Class A-5 or Class A-6 service performed by State employees who were members of Class A-3 or Class A-4 and who elected to be members of Class A-5 or Class A-6 under section 5306.5 shall be determined under this subsection and not subsection (e). (c) Determination of shared-gain adjustment to regular member contributions for Class A-3 and Class A-4 service.-- The regular member contributions for Class A-3 and Class A-4 service shall be determined as follows: (1) For the period from the effective date of this section until June 30, 2017, the regular member contributions for Class A-3 and Class A-4 service shall be determined as otherwise provided in this part. (2) For the period from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2020, if the shared-risk contribution rate for Class A-3 and Class A-4 service is zero and the annual interest rate adopted by the board for use during the period from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016, for the calculation of the normal contribution rate is more than 1% lower than the actual rate of return, net of fees, of the investments of the fund based on market value over the period, then the regular member contribution rate of each member for Class A-3 and Class A-4 service shall be reduced by .5%. In all other situations, the regular member contributions shall be determined as otherwise provided in this part. (3) For each subsequent three-year period, if the shared-risk contribution rate for Class A-3 and Class A-4 is zero, the regular member contribution rate shall be decreased by .5% if the annual interest rate adopted by the board for use during the previous ten-year period for the calculation of the normal contribution rate is more than 1% lower than the actual rate of return, net of fees, of the investments of the fund based on market value over the period. The regular member contribution rate shall be increased by .5% if the annual interest rate adopted by the board for use during the previous ten-year period for the calculation of the normal contribution rate is equal to or greater than the actual rate of return, net of fees, of the investments of the fund based on market value over that period. (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), the regular member contribution rate may not be greater than the product of the basic contribution rate and the class of service multiplier; and the amount of the adjustment to a lower regular member contribution rate may not be greater than the reduction in the actuarially required contribution rate by the experience adjustment factor resulting from investment gains or losses during the determination period in effect on the first day when the new rate would be applied, determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer receives for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), and expressed as a percentage of member compensation. In no event may the adjustment to the regular member contribution rate be more than 2%. For the determination of the regular member contribution rate to be effective July 1, 2020, the determination period shall be January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2019. (5) The shared-gain adjustment to the regular member contribution rate and the factors entering into its calculation shall be certified by the actuary as part of the annual valuations and the actuarial investigation and evaluation of the system conducted every five years under section 5902(j). (6) If the annual interest rate adopted by the board for the calculation is changed during the period used to determine the shared-gain adjustment to the regular member contribution rate, the board, with the advice of the actuary, shall determine the applicable rate during the entire period, expressed as an annual rate. (7) The shared-gain adjustment to the regular member contribution rate for Class A-5 or Class A-6 service performed by State employees who were members of Class A-3 or Class A-4 and who elected to be members of Class A-5 or Class A-6 under section 5306.5 shall be determined under this subsection and not subsection (f). (d) Calculation of regular member contribution rate.-- For purposes of this section, the regular member contribution rate for each member is the product of the basic contribution rate and the class of service multiplier used to determine the regular member contributions for each member. (e) Determination of shared-risk contribution rate for Class A-5 and Class A-6 service.-- The shared-risk contribution for Class A-5 or Class A-6 service shall be determined as follows: (1) For the period from the effective date of this section until June 30, 2023, the shared-risk contribution rate shall be zero.

In all other situations, the shared-risk contribution rate shall be zero. (3) For each subsequent three-year period, if the shared-gain adjustment to regular member contributions is zero, the shared-risk contribution rate shall be increased by .75% if the annual interest rate adopted by the board for use during the previous ten-year period for the calculation of the normal contribution rate is more than 1% greater than the actual rate of return, net of fees, of the investments of the fund based on market value over the period. The shared-risk contribution rate shall be decreased by .75% if the annual interest rate adopted by the board for use during the previous ten-year period for the calculation of the normal contribution rate is equal to or less than the actual rate of return, net of fees, of the investments of the fund based on market value over that period. (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), the shared-risk contribution rate may not be less than zero and may not be more than the experience adjustment factor resulting from investment gains or losses during the determination period in effect on the first day when the new rate would be applied, determined without regard to any setoff the Commonwealth or any eligible employer receives for advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), and expressed as a percentage of member compensation, and shall not be more than 3%.

(6) In the event that the annual interest rate adopted by the board for the calculation is changed during the period used to determine the shared-risk contribution rate, the board, with the advice of the actuary, shall determine the applicable rate during the entire period, expressed as an annual rate. (7) For any fiscal year in which the actual contributions, plus any annual setoff for that fiscal year resulting from advance payment of accrued liability contributions under section 5507(h), by the Commonwealth or an employer are lower than the actuarially required contributions, the prospective shared-risk contribution rate for those employees whose employers are not making the actuarially required contributions shall be zero and shall not subsequently be increased, except as otherwise provided in this section.

These orders shall be approved to the extent that they do not attach moneys in excess of the limits on attachments as established by the laws of the United States and this Commonwealth, require distributions of benefits in a manner that would violate the laws of the United States, any other state or this Commonwealth or require the distribution of funds for support or enforcement of arrearages against a participant who is not receiving distributions from the plan at the time the order is entered. These orders may be approved notwithstanding any other provision of this part or the plan that would require a distribution of accumulated employer defined contributions in the form of an annuity or to require the purchase of an annuity. (d) Obligation discharged.-- Only the requirements of this part and any regulations promulgated hereunder shall be used to govern the approval or disapproval of a domestic relations order. Therefore, if the secretary of the board, or his designated representative, acts in accordance with the provisions of this part and any promulgated regulations in approving or disapproving a domestic relations order, then the obligations of the system or the plan with respect to such approval or disapproval shall be discharged.
