References to the ECU in a contract, security or instrument without such a definition of the ECU shall be presumed, rebuttable by proof of the contrary intention of the parties, to be references to the currency basket that is from time to time used as the unit of account of the European Community.\n\n(d) Effect of agreements.--This section shall not alter or impair and shall be subject to any agreements between parties with specific reference to the introduction of the euro.\n\n(e) Application.--Notwithstanding the provisions of Title 13 (relating to commercial code) or any other law of this Commonwealth, this section shall apply to all contracts, securities and instruments, including contracts with respect to commercial transactions, and shall not be deemed to be displaced by any other law of this Commonwealth.\n\n(f) No application to other currency alteration.--In circumstances of currency alteration other than the introduction of the euro, this section shall not be interpreted as creating any negative inference or negative presumption regarding the validity or enforceability of contracts, securities or instruments denominated in whole or part in a currency affected by that alteration.\n\n(g) Definitions.--As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection:\n\n\"ECU\" or \"European currency unit.\" The currency basket that is from time to time used as the unit of account of the European Community, as defined in European Council Regulation No.3320/94.\n\n\"Euro.\" The currency of participating member states of the European Union that adopt a single currency in accordance with the Treaty on European Union signed February 7, 1992.\n\n\"Introduction of the euro.\" Includes, but is not limited to, the implementation from time to time of economic and monetary union in member states of the European Union in accordance with the Treaty on European Union signed February 7, 1992.",
