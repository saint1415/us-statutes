      "text": "The following interpleader compact is hereby approved, ratified, adopted and entered into by this Commonwealth as a party to take effect between this Commonwealth and any other state of the United States of America when entered into in accordance with the terms of the compact by the other state and not disapproved by the Governor under paragraph (c) of Article 7 of the compact:\n\nThe Interpleader Compact\n\nThe contracting states solemnly agree:\n\nArticle 1. Purpose.--The aims of this compact are to promote comity and judicial cooperation among the states party thereto; and to relieve from undue risk and uncertainty, a person who may be subject to double or multiple liability because of the existence of adverse claimants, one or more of whom in the absence of this compact may not be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudicating court, when such person makes all reasonable efforts to secure judicial determination and discharge of his liability.\n\nArticle 2. Definitions.--For the purpose of this compact the following definitions shall apply:\n\n(a) A state shall mean (1) a state of the United States or any territory or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia acting under Article 1, section 10, clause 3, of the Constitution of the United States in entering this compact with an American or a foreign jurisdiction, or (2) a state of the community of nations and any component governmental unit of such a state which under the laws thereof may validly become party to this compact.\n\n(b) A person shall include any entity capable of suing or being sued in the state in which the interpleader is pending.\n\n(c) Interpleader shall mean a judicial procedure by which two or more persons who have adverse claims against a third person may be required to litigate these claims in one proceeding.\n\nArticle 3. Service of process.--(a) Service of process sufficient to acquire personal jurisdiction may be made within a state party to this compact, by a person who institutes an interpleader proceeding or interpleader part of a proceeding in another state, party to this compact, provided that such service shall fulfill the requirements for service of process of the state in which the service is made and provided further that such service shall meet the minimum standards for service of the jurisdiction where the proceeding is pending.\n\n(b) No such service of process shall be valid unless either: (1) The subject matter of the proceeding is specific real property or tangible personal property situated within the state in which the proceeding is pending; or (2) One or more of the claimants shall be either a permanent resident or domiciliary of the state in which the proceeding is pending; or (3) A significant portion of the transaction out of which the proceeding shall have arisen shall have taken place in the state in which the proceeding is pending; or (4) One of the claimants shall have initiated the action.\n\nArticle 4. Scope of interpleader unaffected.--Nothing in this compact shall be construed to change any requirement or limitation on the scope of interpleader of the state in which the interpleader proceeding is pending except in relation to acquisition of personal jurisdiction.\n\nArticle 5. Finality of judgment.--No judgment obtained against any person in any proceeding to which he had become a party by reason of service of process effected pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be subject to attack on the ground that the adjudicating court did not have personal jurisdiction over such person.\n\nArticle 6. Enactment.--(a) This compact shall enter into force and effect as to a state one year from the date it has taken whatever action may be necessary pursuant to its required processes to make this compact part of the laws of such state and the appropriate authority of such state shall have deposited a duly authenticated copy of its statute, proclamation, order, or similar official pronouncement having the force of law and embodying this compact as law with the appropriate officer or agency of each of the states party thereto. In the statute, proclamation, order, or similar act by which a state adopts this compact, it shall specify the officer or agency with whom the documents referred to in this article shall be deposited.\n\n(b) Unless the statute, proclamation, order, or similar act by which a state adopts this compact shall specify otherwise, and name the states with which the state intends to compact, such adoption shall apply to all other states then party to or who may subsequently become party to this compact. In the event that a state shall enter this compact with some states but not with others, the deposit of documents required by paragraph (a) of this article shall be effected only with those states to which the adopting state specifies an intention to be bound.\n\nArticle 7. Withdrawal.--(a) This compact shall continue in force and remain binding on a party state until such state shall withdraw therefrom. To be valid and effective, any withdrawal must be preceded by a formal notice in writing of one year from the appropriate authority of that state. Such notice shall be communicated to the same officer or agency in each party state with which the notice of adoption was deposited pursuant to Article 6 of this compact. In the event that a state wishes to withdraw with respect to one or more states, but wishes to remain a party to this compact with other states party thereto, its notice of withdrawal shall be communicated only to those states with respect to which withdrawal is contemplated.\n\n(b) Withdrawal shall not be effective as to service of process accomplished pursuant to this compact prior to the actual date of withdrawal.\n\n(c) Any state receiving a notice of adoption from another state may by action of its executive head within a year from the receipt of such notice in the manner provided for withdrawal in paragraph (a) of this article specify its intention not to be bound to the state depositing such notice and such adoption thereupon shall not be binding upon the state so acting.\n\nArticle 8. Severability and construction.--The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, or in the case of a component governmental unit, to the constitution of the state of which it is a part, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby; provided that if this compact shall be held invalid or contrary to the constitution of any government participating therein the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining governments and in full force and effect as to the government affected as to all severable matters. It is the intent that the provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed.",

Its purpose is to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations, and is to be liberally construed and administered.\n\n(b) Effect of alternative remedy.--The General Assembly finds and determines that the principle rendering declaratory relief unavailable in circumstances where an action at law or in equity or a special statutory remedy is available has unreasonably limited the availability of declaratory relief and such principle is hereby abolished. The availability of declaratory relief shall not be limited by the provisions of 1 Pa.C.S. § 1504 (relating to statutory remedy preferred over common law) and the remedy provided by this subchapter shall be additional and cumulative to all other available remedies except as provided in subsection (c). Where another remedy is available the election of the declaratory judgment remedy rather than another available remedy shall not affect the substantive rights of the parties, and the court may pursuant to general rules change venue, require additional pleadings, fix the order of discovery and proof, and take such other action as may be required in the interest of justice.\n\n(c) Exceptions.--Relief shall not be available under this subchapter with respect to any:\n\n(1) Action wherein a divorce or annulment of marriage is sought except as provided by 23 Pa.C.S. § 3306 (relating to proceedings to determine marital status).\n\n(2) Proceeding within the exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal other than a court.\n\n(3) Proceeding involving an appeal from an order of a tribunal.\n\n(Dec. 19, 1990, P.L.1240, No.206, eff. 90 days)\n\n1990 Amendment.Act 206 amended subsec.

A certificate by the Secretary of State of such other state that an officer suing for collection of such a tax is duly authorized to collect the same shall be conclusive proof of such authority.\n\n(b) Interest and penalties.--For the purposes of this section the words \"tax\" and \"taxes\" shall include interest and penalties due under any state taxing statute or local ordinance or resolution. Liability for such interest or penalties, or both, shall be recognized and enforced by the courts of this Commonwealth to the same extent that the laws of such other state permit the enforcement in its courts of liability due under a taxing statute of this Commonwealth or ordinance of any political subdivision thereof.",
