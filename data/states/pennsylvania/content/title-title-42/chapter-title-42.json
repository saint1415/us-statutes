The department may require the person to be examined by a physician, a certified registered nurse practitioner, a physician assistant or a licensed psychologist designated by the department or may require the person to undergo an examination by a physician, a certified registered nurse practitioner, a physician assistant or a licensed psychologist of the person's choice.

This subsection does not bar a lessee in default on an obligation arising from the rental-purchase agreement from asserting a violation of this chapter in an original action or as a defense or counterclaim to an action brought by the lessor to collect amounts owed by the lessee under the rental-purchase agreement.

(a) General rule.-- After a petition has been filed alleging delinquency based on conduct which is designated a crime or public offense under the laws, including local ordinances, of this Commonwealth, the court before hearing the petition on its merits may rule that this chapter is not applicable and that the offense should be prosecuted, and transfer the offense, where appropriate, to the division or a judge of the court assigned to conduct criminal proceedings, for prosecution of the offense if all of the following exist: (1) The child was 14 or more years of age at the time of the alleged conduct. (2) A hearing on whether the transfer should be made is held in conformity with this chapter. (3) Notice in writing of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing is given to the child and his parents, guardian, or other custodian at least three days before the hearing. (4) The court finds: (i) that there is a prima facie case that the child committed the delinquent act alleged; (ii) that the delinquent act would be considered a felony if committed by an adult; (iii) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the public interest is served by the transfer of the case for criminal prosecution.

(b) Chapter inapplicable following transfer.-- The transfer terminates the applicability of this chapter over the child with respect to the delinquent acts alleged in the petition. (c) Transfer at request of child.-- The child may request that the case be transferred for prosecution in which event the court may order this chapter not applicable. (d) Effect of transfer from criminal proceedings.-- No hearing shall be conducted where this chapter becomes applicable because of a previous determination by the court in a criminal proceeding. (e) Murder and other excluded acts.-- Where the petition alleges conduct which if proven would constitute murder, or any of the offenses excluded by paragraph (2)(ii) or (iii) of the definition of \"delinquent act\" in section 6302 (relating to definitions), the court shall require the offense to be prosecuted under the criminal law and procedures, except where the case has been transferred pursuant to section 6322 (relating to transfer from criminal proceedings) from the division or a judge of the court assigned to conduct criminal proceedings. (f) Transfer action interlocutory.-- The decision of the court to transfer or not to transfer the case shall be interlocutory. (g) Burden of proof.-- The burden of establishing by a preponderance of evidence that the public interest is served by the transfer of the case to criminal court and that a child is not amenable to treatment, supervision or rehabilitation as a juvenile shall rest with the Commonwealth unless the following apply: (1) (i) a deadly weapon as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2301 (relating to definitions) was used and the child was 14 years of age at the time of the offense; or (ii) the child was 15 years of age or older at the time of the offense and was previously adjudicated delinquent of a crime that would be considered a felony if committed by an adult; and (2) there is a prima facie case that the child committed a delinquent act which, if committed by an adult, would be classified as rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated assault as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1) or (2) (relating to aggravated assault), robbery as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3701(a)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) (relating to robbery), robbery of motor vehicle, aggravated indecent assault, kidnapping, voluntary manslaughter, an attempt, conspiracy or solicitation to commit any of these crimes or an attempt to commit murder as specified in paragraph (2)(ii) of the definition of \"delinquent act\" in section 6302.

Only the attorneys for the defendant and for the Commonwealth, the court reporter, the judge, persons necessary to operate the equipment and any person whose presence would contribute to the welfare and well-being of the child victim or child material witness, including persons designated under section 5983 (relating to rights and services), may be present in the room with the child during his testimony. The court shall permit the defendant to observe and hear the testimony of the child victim or child material witness but shall ensure that the child cannot hear or see the defendant. The court shall make certain that the defendant and defense counsel have adequate opportunity to communicate for the purposes of providing an effective defense. Examination and cross-examination of the child victim or child material witness shall proceed in the same manner as normally permitted. (a.1) Determination.-- Before the court orders the child victim or the child material witness to testify by a contemporaneous alternative method, the court must determine, based on evidence presented to it, that testifying either in an open forum in the presence and full view of the finder of fact or in the defendant's presence will result in the child victim or child material witness suffering serious emotional distress that would substantially impair the child victim's or child material witness's ability to reasonably communicate. In making this determination, the court may do all of the following: (1) Observe and question the child victim or child material witness, either inside or outside the courtroom. (2) Hear testimony of a parent or custodian or any other person, such as a person who has dealt with the child victim or child material witness in a medical or therapeutic setting.

(3) Is in need of involuntary treatment due to a mental abnormality or personality disorder which results in serious difficulty in controlling sexually violent behavior that makes the person likely to engage in an act of sexual violence. (b) Procedures for initiating court-ordered involuntary commitment.-- (1) Where, pursuant to the provisions of section 6358(f) (relating to assessment of delinquent children by the State Sexual Offenders Assessment Board), the court determines that a prima facie case has been presented that the child is in need of involuntary treatment under the provisions of this chapter, the court shall order that a petition be filed by the county solicitor or a designee before the court having jurisdiction of the person pursuant to Chapter 63 (relating to juvenile matters). (2) The petition shall be in writing in a form adopted by the department and shall set forth the facts constituting reasonable grounds to believe the individual is within the criteria for court-ordered involuntary treatment as set forth in subsection (a). The petition shall include the assessment of the person by the board as required in section 6358. (3) The court shall set a date for the hearing which shall be held within 30 days of the filing of the petition pursuant to paragraph (1) and direct the person to appear for the hearing. A copy of the petition and notice of the hearing date shall be served on the person, the attorney who represented the person at the most recent dispositional review hearing pursuant to section 6358(e) and the county solicitor or a designee.

(2) The person shall have the right to confront and cross-examine all witnesses and to present evidence on the person's own behalf. (3) The hearing shall be public. (4) A stenographic or other sufficient record shall be made. (5) The hearing shall be conducted by the court. (6) A decision shall be rendered within five days after the conclusion of the hearing. (d) Determination and order.-- Upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the person has a mental abnormality or personality disorder which results in serious difficulty in controlling sexually violent behavior that makes the person likely to engage in an act of sexual violence, an order shall be entered directing the immediate commitment of the person for involuntary inpatient treatment to a facility designated by the department. The order shall be in writing and shall be consistent with the protection of the public safety and the appropriate control, care and treatment of the person. An appeal shall not stay the execution of the order. If the court does not order the person to be committed for involuntary inpatient treatment by the department, the court shall order the director of the facility operated by the department pursuant to section 6406(a) to destroy the facility's copy of the petition and the assessment.

As used in this paragraph, \"negligent acts\" shall not include acts or conduct which constitutes a crime, actual fraud, actual malice or willful misconduct. (b) Acts which may impose liability.-- The following acts by a local agency or any of its employees may result in the imposition of liability on a local agency: (1) Vehicle liability.-- The operation of any motor vehicle in the possession or control of the local agency, provided that the local agency shall not be liable to any plaintiff that claims liability under this subsection if the plaintiff was, during the course of the alleged negligence, in flight or fleeing apprehension or resisting arrest by a police officer or knowingly aided a group, one or more of whose members were in flight or fleeing apprehension or resisting arrest by a police officer. As used in this paragraph, \"motor vehicle\" means any vehicle which is self-propelled and any attachment thereto, including vehicles operated by rail, through water or in the air. (2) Care, custody or control of personal property.-- The care, custody or control of personal property of others in the possession or control of the local agency. The only losses for which damages shall be recoverable under this paragraph are those property losses suffered with respect to the personal property in the possession or control of the local agency.

(5) Utility service facilities.-- A dangerous condition of the facilities of steam, sewer, water, gas or electric systems owned by the local agency and located within rights-of-way, except that the claimant to recover must establish that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred and that the local agency had actual notice or could reasonably be charged with notice under the circumstances of the dangerous condition at a sufficient time prior to the event to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.

(ii) A dangerous condition of streets owned or under the jurisdiction of Commonwealth agencies, if all of the following conditions are met: (A) The local agency has entered into a written contract with a Commonwealth agency for the maintenance and repair by the local agency of such streets and the contract either: (I) had not expired or been otherwise terminated prior to the occurrence of the injury; or (II) if expired, contained a provision that expressly established local agency responsibility beyond the term of the contract for injuries arising out of the local agency's work. (B) The injury and dangerous condition were directly caused by the negligent performance of its duties under such contract. (C) The claimant must establish that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred and that the local agency had actual notice or could reasonably be charged with notice under the circumstances of the dangerous condition at a sufficient time prior to the event to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition. (7) Sidewalks.-- A dangerous condition of sidewalks within the rights-of-way of streets owned by the local agency, except that the claimant to recover must establish that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred and that the local agency had actual notice or could reasonably be charged with notice under the circumstances of the dangerous condition at a sufficient time prior to the event to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition. When a local agency is liable for damages under this paragraph by reason of its power and authority to require installation and repair of sidewalks under the care, custody and control of other persons, the local agency shall be secondarily liable only and such other persons shall be primarily liable. (8) Care, custody or control of animals.-- The care, custody or control of animals in the possession or control of a local agency, including but not limited to police dogs and horses. Damages shall not be recoverable under this paragraph on account of any injury caused by wild animals, including but not limited to bears and deer, except as otherwise provided by statute.

(a) Prisoner filing requirements.-- (1) A prisoner seeking to bring prison conditions litigation without the prepayment of fees or security due to indigency must submit a request to the court to proceed without the prepayment of fees. The request must include a certified copy of the prisoner's prison account statement, which shall be provided by the prison, for the six-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal. The request shall include a statement of any other assets of the prisoner. (2) The court shall deny in forma pauperis status to any prisoner where: (i) the request is not accompanied by a certified copy as provided in paragraph (1); (ii) the average monthly deposits or average highest monthly balance for the six-month period preceding the filing of the action exceeds the amount of the filing fee; or (iii) other grounds exist for the denial of in forma pauperis status pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. (b) Partial filing fees.-- (1) The court may grant in forma pauperis status to excuse the prisoner from paying the full filing fee prior to the initiation of the action or appeal. Where in forma pauperis status is granted, the court shall order the prisoner to pay the full amount of the filing fee and shall assess and, when funds exist, collect a full or partial payment of the filing fee which shall be the greater of the following: (i) The average monthly deposits to the prisoner's account. (ii) The average highest monthly balance in the prisoner's account for the six-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal requiring the payment of a fee. (2) The court shall send a copy of the assessment order to the prisoner, the parties to the action and the prison having custody of the prisoner. The court may also direct upon condition of maintaining the action that the prisoner make a written request to the prison officials to deduct payments required by the court. (3) The court may modify the assessment order for cause. (c) Payment of filing fees.-- Following payment of an initial partial filing fee, the prisoner shall make monthly payments of 20% of the preceding month's income credited to the prisoner's account. The prison having custody of the prisoner shall deduct payments from the prisoner's account when the prisoner's account balance exceeds $10 until the filing fees are paid in full. The prison shall forward to the prothonotary the deducted payments upon deduction, on a monthly basis, or upon complete payment of the full filing fee if the court so directs. The Department of Corrections and county prison systems shall develop written guidelines regarding the priority of payment, which shall be consistent with law. (d) Implementation of filing fee assessments.-- (1) A prisoner shall not be prohibited from filing prison conditions litigation because the prisoner has no assets or other means to pay the filing fee. This paragraph shall not prevent the court from dismissing or otherwise disposing of prison conditions litigation pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law. (2) No sooner than 60 days after notice of the denial in forma pauperis status or the assessment of partial filing fees, the prothonotary shall enter a judgment of non pros in the action or strike the appeal if the fees remain unpaid. The action or appeal may be reinstated by the court for good cause shown. (e) Dismissal of litigation.-- Notwithstanding any filing fee which has been paid, the court shall dismiss prison conditions litigation at any time, including prior to service on the defendant, if the court determines any of the following: (1) The allegation of indigency is untrue. (2) The prison conditions litigation is frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or the defendant is entitled to assert a valid affirmative defense, including immunity, which, if asserted, would preclude the relief. The court may reinstate the prison conditions litigation where the dismissal is based upon an untrue allegation of indigency and the prisoner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the untrue information was not known to the prisoner. (f) Abusive litigation.-- If the prisoner has previously filed prison conditions litigation and: (1) three or more of these prior civil actions have been dismissed pursuant to subsection (e)(2); or (2) the prisoner has previously filed prison conditions litigation against a person named as a defendant in the instant action or a person serving in the same official capacity as a named defendant and a court made a finding that the prior action was filed in bad faith or that the prisoner knowingly presented false evidence or testimony at a hearing or trial; the court may dismiss the action. The court shall not, however, dismiss a request for preliminary injunctive relief or a temporary restraining order which makes a credible allegation that the prisoner is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury.

(b) Prisoner release orders.-- The court shall enter a prisoner release order only if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that crowding is the primary cause of the violation. The government party with jurisdiction over the prison subject to the prisoner release order or the prosecution or custody of persons who may be released from prison as a result of a prisoner release order shall have standing to intervene in any related proceeding and to oppose the imposition or continuation of the order and to seek termination of the order. No prisoner release order shall be entered unless: (1) a court previously entered an order for less intrusive relief which has failed to remedy the violation sought to be remedied.

The contractor shall also require the subcontractor to make similar payments to his subcontractors. (7) The department shall have the right to engage the services of any architect or consulting or supervising engineer or engineers whom it may deem necessary for the proper designing of or inspection or supervision of projects constructed, altered or enlarged by the department under this section in accordance with the selection procedures of section 905. (8) Changes in scope in the plans or specifications, or both, may be made after their approval only with the consent of the Governor and all of the Commonwealth agencies and State-related institutions whose approval of the original plans or specifications, or both, was necessary under this section.

The agency's decision to discuss such matters in executive session shall not serve to adversely affect the due process rights granted by law, including those granted by Title 2 (relating to administrative law and procedure). The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any meeting involving the appointment or selection of any person to fill a vacancy in any elected office. (2) To hold information, strategy and negotiation sessions related to the negotiation or arbitration of a collective bargaining agreement or, in the absence of a collective bargaining unit, related to labor relations and arbitration. (3) To consider the purchase or lease of real property up to the time an option to purchase or lease the real property is obtained or up to the time an agreement to purchase or lease such property is obtained if the agreement is obtained directly without an option. (4) To consult with its attorney or other professional advisor regarding information or strategy in connection with litigation or with issues on which identifiable complaints are expected to be filed. (5) To review and discuss agency business which, if conducted in public, would violate a lawful privilege or lead to the disclosure of information or confidentiality protected by law, including matters related to the initiation and conduct of investigations of possible or certain violations of the law and quasi-judicial deliberations. (6) For duly constituted committees of a board or council of trustees of a State-owned, State-aided or State-related college or university or community college or of the Board of Governors of the State System of Higher Education to discuss matters of academic admission or standings. (7) To discuss, plan or review matters and records that are deemed necessary for emergency preparedness, protection of public safety and security of all property in a manner that if disclosed would be reasonably likely to jeopardize or threaten public safety or preparedness or public protection. (b) Procedure.-- The executive session may be held during an open meeting or at the conclusion of an open meeting or may be announced for a future time. The reason for holding the executive session must be announced at the open meeting occurring immediately prior or subsequent to the executive session. If the executive session is not announced for a future specific time, members of the agency shall be notified 24 hours in advance of the time of the convening of the meeting specifying the date, time, location and purpose of the executive session. (c) Limitation.-- Official action on discussions held pursuant to subsection (a) shall be taken at an open meeting. Nothing in this section or section 707 (relating to exceptions to open meetings) shall be construed to require that any meeting be closed to the public, nor shall any executive session be used as a subterfuge to defeat the purposes of section 704 (relating to open meetings).

(II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of senior passengers. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of senior passengers for all local transportation organizations.

(3) For the 2007-2008 fiscal year, no local transportation organization shall receive total financial assistance under this subsection that would be more than 50% higher than the amount it receives under paragraph (2)(i). For each subsequent fiscal year, the increase in the total financial assistance provided to each local transportation organization shall not exceed 20% of the prior year allocation. (c.1) Minimum.-- No local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance under this section in an amount less than the amount received in the previous fiscal year. (d) Local match requirements.-- (1) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, except as provided under paragraph (2), financial assistance provided under this section shall be matched by local or private cash funding in an amount not less than the greater of: (i) 15% of the amount of the financial assistance being provided; or (ii) the amount required under former section 1311(d) (relating to use of funds distributed) for fiscal year 2006-2007. (2) Beginning in fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, if the local matching funds provided are less than 15% of the amount of financial assistance received, the local transportation organization's required local matching funds shall increase annually in order to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). The local matching funds shall be increased annually by a minimum of 5% above the amount of local matching funds provided in the previous fiscal year unless a lesser amount is necessary to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). (3) Eligible local matching funds shall consist only of cash contributions provided by one or more municipalities or counties. The amount of the match and the time period during which the match must continue to be available shall be specified in the financial assistance agreement. Funding provided by local and private entities, including advertising or naming rights, may qualify as local matching funds to the extent they provide for the cost of transit service that is open to the public. The following shall not be considered local matching funds: (i) Any form of transit operating revenue or other forms of transit income provided by the local transportation organization. (ii) Funds used to replace fares. (4) A municipality in a metropolitan area which is a member of a local transportation organization is authorized to provide annual financial assistance from current revenues to the local transportation organization of which it is a member or enter into a long-term agreement for payment of money to assist in defraying the costs of operation, maintenance and debt service of the local transportation organization or of a particular public transportation project of a local transportation organization. The obligation of a municipality under an agreement pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered to be a part of the indebtedness of the municipality, nor shall the obligation be deemed to impair the status of any indebtedness of the municipality which would otherwise be considered self-sustaining. (e) Performance reviews.-- (1) The department may conduct performance reviews of an award recipient under this section to determine the effectiveness of the financial assistance. Reviews shall be conducted at regular intervals as established by the department in consultation with the management of the award recipient. After completion of a review, the department shall issue a report that: (i) highlights exceptional performance and identifies any problems that need to be resolved; (ii) assesses performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of the financial assistance; (iii) makes recommendations on follow-up actions required to remedy any problem identified; and (iv) provides an action plan documenting who should perform the recommended actions and a time frame within which they should be performed. (2) The department shall deliver the report to the Governor, to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the Senate and to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives. The department's regulations shall contain a description of the impact on both the amount of, and future eligibility for, financial assistance under this chapter based upon the degree to which the local transportation organization complies with the recommendations in the report. The department shall develop a list of best practices revealed by the reports issued under this subsection and shall post them on the department's Internet website. (f) Performance criteria.-- Criteria used for the reviews conducted under subsection (e) shall consist of passengers per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per revenue vehicle hour, operating revenue per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per passenger and other items as the department may establish. The department's regulations shall set forth the minimum system performance criteria based upon comparison of the award recipient to its past performance and to its peers that an award recipient must satisfy. (g) Failure to satisfy minimum performance criteria.-- (1) If a performance review conducted under subsection (e) reveals that the performance of an award recipient's transportation system has decreased compared to performance determined through a prior review, the department may, upon the written request of an award recipient, waive any requirement for a reduction in the amount of financial assistance to be awarded under this section for a reasonable time period to allow the award recipient to bring the system back to the required performance level. The award recipient shall provide written justification for providing a time period longer than two years. In order to obtain the waiver for the period requested, the award recipient must do all of the following: (i) Develop an action plan to improve system performance that contains key measurable milestones. The action plan must be acceptable to the department and must be approved by the department in writing. (ii) Submit quarterly progress reports on the action plan to the department. (2) The department shall review and evaluate the award recipient's progress to determine if the system has improved. If the system has improved, the award recipient will remain eligible for full formula funding as determined under subsection (c). If the system has not improved by the end of the waiver period, the waiver will be withdrawn. Expenses incurred by the award recipient as a result of the failure of the award recipient's system to meet the minimum performance criteria shall be borne by the award recipient. (h) Adjustments to minimum performance criteria.-- Upon written request of an award recipient, the department may adjust the minimum performance criteria described in subsection (g) in a given year if the performance of the award recipient's system is adversely affected by circumstances which are beyond the award recipient's control. Examples are labor strikes, infrastructure failures and natural disasters. The request must include the award recipient's reasons for seeking the adjustment. Cross References.

Within 30 days of the date specified in section 1905(a) (relating to county-level court administrators), each employing county shall provide, in writing, to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, all leave information requested by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania for those individuals designated in section 1905(a). The payment to be made by each employing county shall be determined based upon an actuarial evaluation performed by an actuary appointed by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania from a list of three actuaries to be submitted by the Secretary of the Budget within 30 days of the effective date of this subchapter. The actuarial evaluation shall be based upon assumptions determined by the actuary to be appropriate under the circumstances to arrive at a fair and reasonable determination of an actuarially equivalent value of the accrued sick leave and annual leave transferred and credited under section 2394. The actuary shall submit the actuarial evaluation to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts within 60 days of the receipt of all information necessary to prepare such evaluation. If any employing county fails to provide the information required by this section, the county shall be subject to a penalty of $100 per day for each transferred employee until the required information is provided. Such penalties shall be paid into the fund. (b) Notice of payment due and payment method.-- Following receipt of the actuarial evaluation required by subsection (a), the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts shall notify in writing each employing county of the actuarial value attributable to that county for accrued sick leave and annual leave transferred and credited under section 2394. Each employing county shall be obligated to the Commonwealth for payment of the actuarial value of the accrued sick leave and annual leave transferred and credited under section 2394. Payment shall be made to the Commonwealth by each employing county within 90 days of the date of the written notice from the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts to the employing county, which date is referred to for purposes of this section as the payment due date. Any payment not received from an employing county by the payment due date shall be subject to the imposition of interest from the day following the payment due date at the rate determined by the Secretary of Revenue for interest payments on overdue taxes or the refund of taxes as provided in sections 806 and 806.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code, and any subsequent amendments to those sections, plus 2% until paid in full. (c) Recoupment of employing county arrearages.-- If an employing county fails to submit a payment by the payment due date established under subsection (b), the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts shall withhold and withdraw such payment, plus applicable interest, if any, from moneys next due to be paid to the employing county in the form of grants, subsidies or other payments to counties which are made by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts. Any moneys withheld or withdrawn under this subsection or received under subsection (b) shall be transferred to and deposited in the fund created under subsection (d) and credited to the employing county's financial obligation under this subchapter. (d) Establishment of fund.-- There is hereby created a special nonlapsing fund in the State Treasury to be known as the Unified Judicial System Transferred County-Level Administrator Leave Fund. All moneys received from employing counties under this section and all investment income earned on those moneys shall be deposited in the fund. All moneys placed in the fund and the investment income it accrues are hereby appropriated on a continuing basis to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, upon requisition by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania, to be applied solely to the cost of leave payments made under section 2396(c) (relating to leave following transfer). The requisition authority granted with regard to the fund is in addition to the requisition authority contained in section 1501 of The Fiscal Code. (e) Fund deficiency.-- If money in the fund is not adequate to provide for full payment of the counties' share of leave payments, the amount necessary to fully fund the counties' share of leave payments shall become an obligation of the unified judicial system. (f) Fund surplus.-- When all leave payments for transferred administrators required to be made under this subchapter have been made, any surplus remaining in the fund shall be transferred to and is hereby appropriated to the General Fund.

      "text": "§ 3112. Traffic-control signals. (a) General rule.-- Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: (1) Green indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn except that vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited. (ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113 (relating to pedestrian-control signals), pedestrians facing any green signal may proceed across the roadway within a crosswalk. (2) Steady yellow indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green indication is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113, pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. (3) Steady red indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, or if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subparagraph (ii). (ii) Unless signing is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way highway onto a one-way highway after stopping as required by subparagraph (i). Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. (b) Places other than intersections.-- In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. (c) Inoperable or malfunctioning signal.-- If a traffic-control signal is out of operation or is not functioning properly, including, but not limited to, a signal that uses inductive loop sensors or other automated technology to detect the presence of vehicles that fails to detect a vehicle, vehicular traffic facing a: (1) Green or yellow signal may proceed with caution as indicated in subsection (a)(1) and (2). (2) Red or completely unlighted signal shall stop in the same manner as at a stop sign, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign as provided in section 3323 (relating to stop signs and yield signs).

It provides employment for and incomes of hundreds of thousands of the people of this Commonwealth and, in turn, millions of persons in the United States.

(a) General rule.-- This subpart applies to all cooperatives created within this Commonwealth after the effective date of this subpart, but, if such a cooperative contains only units restricted to nonresidential use, it is subject only to sections 4106 (relating to applicability of local ordinances, regulations and building codes) and 4107 (relating to eminent domain) unless the declaration provides that the entire subpart is applicable. (b) Existing cooperatives.-- Except as provided in subsection (c), sections 4106, 4107, 4203 (relating to construction and validity of declaration and bylaws), 4219 (relating to master associations), 4220 (relating to merger or consolidation of cooperatives), 4302(a)(1) through (6) and (11) through (17) (relating to powers of association), 4311 (relating to tort and contract liability), 4315 (relating to lien for assessments), 4317 (relating to association records), 4319 (relating to termination of cooperative interest), 4409 (relating to resales of cooperative interests) and 4415 (relating to effect of violations on rights of action), and section 4103 (relating to definitions) to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subpart and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. By compliance with the requirements of section 4201 (relating to creation of cooperative ownership), a cooperative created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart may be made subject to all of the provisions of this subpart, effective as of the date of recordation of the document or documents specified in section 4201, without in any way terminating the cooperative status of the property or in any way affecting any lien or encumbrance on the property, if the terms of such document or documents have been approved by all the persons whose actions would have been required to effect the termination of the cooperative pursuant to its governing documents in effect at the time such approval is given, provided, however, that such action shall not increase the obligations or responsibilities of a declarant, as such and not as a proprietary lessee, without the joinder of the declarant in the document or documents required by section 4201. (b.1) Retroactivity.-- (1) Sections 4103, 4108 (relating to supplemental general principles of law applicable), 4112 (relating to obligation of good faith), 4216 (relating to amendment of declaration), 4217(g) (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), 4302(a)(8)(i) and (9), 4303(a), (b) and (c) (relating to executive board members and officers), 4307 (relating to upkeep of cooperative), 4314 (relating to assessments for common expenses) and 4316 (relating to other liens affecting cooperative), to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. (2) Section 4303(d), to the extent necessary in construing that subsection, applies to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but the subsection applies only with respect to events and circumstances occurring 180 days after the effective date of this subsection and does not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those cooperatives. (c) Units restricted to nonresidential use.-- If a cooperative created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains only units restricted to nonresidential use, it is subject only to sections 4106 and 4107 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that cooperative from the date such amended declaration is recorded as required for a declaration under section 4201. (d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart. (2) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made pursuant to this subpart. An amendment to the declaration or bylaws authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the declaration and bylaws being amended. If any such amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this subpart, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in this subpart also apply to that person. (e) Cooperative interests outside Commonwealth.-- This subpart does not apply to cooperative interests located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions (sections 4401 through 4408) apply to all cooperative interests offered within this Commonwealth for which either the contract for disposition is executed by any party within this Commonwealth or the disposition is effectuated within this Commonwealth unless exempt under section 4401(b) (relating to applicability; waiver). (f) Liens and security interests.-- The enactment of this subpart shall not affect any lien upon a cooperative or any lien upon or security interest in any property of the association or in any cooperative interest if such lien or security interest shall have been perfected prior to the effective date of this subpart.

(b) Permanent copy substituted for original.-- Upon the granting of a petition transferring custody of any historical documents, the officer from whose custody it was removed shall substitute in his files a certified permanent copy of such document, which shall be of the same force and effect as the original document. (c) Petition for return of document.-- The appropriate county officer may at any time, without cause, petition the court for the return of any historical document, the custody of which had been previously transferred to any person pursuant to subsection (a). (d) Order for return on motion of court.-- The court, after having taken jurisdiction of the transfer of any historical document, may, without cause, and upon its own motion, order the person having such temporary custody to return such document to the appropriate office wherein it had been originally filed. (e) Definition.-- As used in this section \"historical document\" means any document formerly belonging to a decedent or any other person, which document is more than 50 years old and which is in the custody of a register of wills, the recorder of deeds, the clerk of any court or the prothonotary, except documents relating to adoption, divorce or custody.",

(b) Transfer of declarant responsibility.-- A declarant may transfer responsibility for preparation of all or a part of the public offering statement to a successor declarant (section 4304) or to a person in the business of selling cooperative interests who intends to offer cooperative interests in the cooperative for his own account. In the event of any such transfer, the transferor shall provide the transferee with any information necessary to enable the transferee to fulfill the requirements of subsection (a). (c) Offering cooperative interest for own account.-- Any declarant or successor declarant or other person in the business of selling cooperative interests who offers a cooperative interest for his own account to a purchaser shall deliver a public offering statement in the manner prescribed in section 4408(a) (relating to purchaser's right to cancel).

      "text": "§ 4412. Cooperatives containing conversion buildings. (a) Notice of conversion.-- The declarant of every cooperative containing one or more conversion buildings shall give each of the residential tenants and subtenants, if any, lawfully in possession of a unit or units in a conversion building a conversion notice no later than one year before the declarant will require residential tenants and residential subtenants to vacate, subject to revocation of such notice in accordance with subsection (k). The conversion notice must set forth generally the rights of residential tenants and residential subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the residential tenant and residential subtenant at the address of the unit and not more than one other mailing address provided by a residential tenant. Every notice shall be accompanied by a public offering statement concerning the proposed sale of cooperative interests within such conversion building or buildings. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), no such residential tenant or residential subtenant in a conversion building may be required to vacate the unit he leases earlier than one year after the conversion notice date, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a period occurring in whole or in part after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during that period. Failure to give notice to a residential tenant or residential subtenant entitled to such notice pursuant to this subsection is a defense to an action for possession against such residential tenant or residential subtenant. (b) Offer to tenant to purchase cooperative interest.-- For six months after the conversion notice date, the declarant shall offer to convey the cooperative interest for each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use in a conversion building to the tenant who leases that unit. If the tenant fails to purchase the cooperative interest during that six-month period, the offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in that cooperative interest during the following six months at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection shall not apply to any cooperative interest in a conversion building if the unit which is part of that cooperative interest was, immediately prior to the conversion notice date, restricted or devoted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of which unit, after the creation of the cooperative, will not substantially conform to the boundaries of such unit on the conversion notice date. (c) Effect of wrongful conveyance.-- If a declarant, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a cooperative interest to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, that conveyance extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that cooperative interest if the deed states that the declarant has complied with subsection (b), but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of subsection (b). (d) Notice to vacate.-- If a conversion notice specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, the conversion notice also constitutes a notice of termination of the tenant's lease, subject to revocation in accordance with subsection (k) and a notice to quit specified by section 501 of the act of April 6, 1951 (P.L.69, No.20), known as The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951. (e) Improper lease termination prohibited.-- (1) Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease in violation of its terms. (2) Nothing in this section or in any lease shall prohibit a residential tenant, after receiving notice pursuant to subsection (a), from terminating any lease without any liability for such termination provided such tenant gives the building owner at least 90 days' written notice of the intent to terminate the lease. (3) The declarant and, if different, the owner shall not engage in any activity of any nature which would coerce any residential tenant of a conversion building into terminating any lease, including, but not limited to, stampeding, harassing tenants or withholding normal services or repairs. (f) Units leased to senior citizens and blind and disabled persons.-- (1) For the purpose of this subsection, an eligible tenant or subtenant shall be a natural person who, on the conversion notice date, lawfully occupies the unit as his principal residence and is 62 years of age or older or is disabled. For the purpose of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to be \"disabled\" if, on the conversion notice date, he is totally and permanently unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impediment, including, but not limited to, blindness. (2) Within 60 days after the conversion notice date, any tenant or subtenant in possession of a unit who believes that he is an eligible tenant or subtenant shall so notify the declarant and shall provide the declarant with proof of his eligibility. Any eligible tenant or subtenant who has established his eligibility shall be entitled to remain in possession of his unit for two years following the conversion notice date, notwithstanding any prior termination date in his lease, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other occupants' peaceful enjoyment of the cooperative, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a time period after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during the time period between the original lease termination date and the expiration of this two-year period, except as is provided in paragraph (3). (3) The monthly rental payable by the tenant during the time period between the later to occur of the original lease termination date or the first anniversary of the conversion notice date and the expiration of the two-year period described in paragraph (2) sentence shall be the same monthly rental as was payable for the month immediately preceding the original lease termination date, except that, at the landlord's option, such monthly rental may be increased by the lesser of 5% of such monthly rental or the same percentage increase as the percentage increase, if any, in the cost of living in the United States during the six-month time period commencing on the first day of the first full calendar month after the conversion notice date. (4) Failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection is a defense to an action for possession. (g) Tenant meetings.-- With respect to any cooperative containing a conversion building with one or more units then occupied for residential use, at least 30 days before the conversion notice date, the declarant shall hold a tenant meeting open to the public in the municipality where the conversion is proposed at a place and time convenient to the persons who may be directly affected by the conversion. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given to tenants and subtenants in lawful possession of their units in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice and to the general public by a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the cooperative is located, except that no notice to the general public need be given with respect to conversion buildings in cooperatives as to which the provisions of section 4401(b) (relating to applicability; waiver) are applicable. At such meeting, representatives of the declarant shall briefly describe the following and may, but shall not be required to, discuss other matters: (1) The rights and obligations of tenants and subtenants pursuant to this section. (2) Improvements, if any, then planned to be made to the cooperative. (3) The anticipated approximate range of initial cooperative interest sales prices, but specific sales prices need not be provided. (4) The anticipated approximate range of estimated monthly common expense liabilities for various types of cooperative interests but specific per cooperative interest estimates need not be provided. (h) Waiver of right to purchase.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this subpart prohibiting waiver of rights, any tenant or subtenant may waive his right to purchase a cooperative interest pursuant to subsection (b) if the waiver is in writing, is acknowledged and is given in consideration of: (1) a written extension of the term of that tenant's tenancy and right of occupancy under this subpart beyond the time period required by subsection (a) or (f) as applicable; (2) the tenant entering into an agreement to purchase another cooperative interest in the cooperative; or (3) the tenant or subtenant making alternative living arrangements. (i) Alteration of term of tenancy.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (a) or (f), the terms of the tenancy of a tenant or subtenant may be altered with the express written consent of that tenant or subtenant, and such altered terms shall then be the terms of tenancy referred to in this section. (j) Limitation to tenants in occupancy.-- The provisions of this section shall apply only with respect to conversion buildings in which one or more residential tenants or residential subtenants is in lawful occupancy on the conversion notice date, and the only tenants who are entitled to exercise the rights granted under this section are residential tenants or residential subtenants: (1) who are in lawful occupancy of a conversion building on the conversion notice date; or (2) who commence their tenancy after the conversion notice date without having been notified in writing at or prior to the commencement of their tenancy that the property is then a cooperative and that they are not entitled to the rights granted under this section. Such rights continue only so long as the lawful occupancy of the tenant or subtenant continues. (k) Revocation of conversion notice.-- A declarant may subsequently revoke a conversion notice if the declarant has expressly reserved the right of revocation in the conversion notice and if the notice of revocation: (1) is given prior to the conveyance of any unit in the cooperative occurring after the conversion notice date other than a cooperative interest or cooperative interests conveyed to a successor declarant or as a result of a foreclosure of a mortgage on a cooperative interest or a deed in lieu thereof; (2) is given in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice; and (3) is given to all persons who were entitled to receive the conversion notice and who continue to be in lawful occupancy at the time such notice of revocation is given. The giving of a notice of revocation revokes all rights granted under this section, but does not revoke the rights granted to residential tenants under subsection (a) or (f), and such rights shall be deemed to have been incorporated in each residential tenant's lease.

(2) Any model or description of the physical characteristics of the cooperative, including plans and specifications of or for improvements, if incorporated by reference in a public offering statement or other written statement or document signed by the seller and relied upon by the buyer in accordance with this subsection creates an express warranty that the cooperative will conform substantially to the model or description. (3) Any description of the quantity or extent of the real estate comprising the cooperative if incorporated by reference in a public offering statement or other written statement or document signed by the seller and relied upon by the buyer in accordance with this subsection, including, but not limited to, plats or surveys, creates an express warranty that the cooperative will conform to the description, subject to customary tolerances. (4) A provision that a buyer of a cooperative interest may put a unit which is part of that cooperative interest only to a specified use is an express warranty that the specified use is lawful. (b) Formal words unnecessary.-- Neither formal words, such as \"warranty\" or \"guarantee,\" nor a specific intention to make a warranty are necessary to create an express warranty of quality, but a statement purporting to be merely an opinion or commendation of the real estate or its value does not create a warranty. (c) Transfer of warranty.-- Any conveyance of a cooperative interest transfers to the purchaser all express warranties of quality made by previous sellers. (d) Limitation of actions.-- No action to enforce the warranty created by this section shall be commenced later than six years after the date of the writing which creates the warranty under subsection (a).",

(a) Definition.-- As used in this section, \"structural defects\" means those defects in components constituting any unit or common element which reduce the stability or safety of the structure below accepted standards or restrict the normal intended use of all or part of the structure and which require repair, renovation, restoration or replacement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make the warrantor responsible for any items of maintenance relating to the units or common elements. (b) General rule.-- A declarant warrants against structural defects in each of the units for two years from the date each is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser and all of the common elements for two years. Any conveyance of a cooperative interest during the two-year warranty period shall be deemed to transfer to the purchaser all of the warranties created under this section. The two years shall begin as to each of the common elements whenever the common element has been completed or, if later: (1) as to any common element in real estate that may be added to the cooperative, at the time the first cooperative interest for a unit in such real estate is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; (2) as to any common element for which a development right to convert such common element to units or limited common elements has been reserved, at the time the first cooperative interest for a converted unit out of such common element is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; and (3) as to any common element within any other portion of the cooperative, at the time the first cooperative interest in the cooperative is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. (c) Scope and applicability of warranties.-- A declarant of a cooperative containing one or more conversion buildings warrants: (1) against structural defects in components installed in each of the conversion buildings by the declarant or in work done or improvements made by the declarant in each of the conversion buildings; (2) that all units and common elements in each conversion building have been inspected for visible structural and mechanical defects and for other visible conditions that adversely affect the health or safety of residential occupants as required by section 4406(a)(1)(i) (relating to public offering statement; cooperatives containing conversion buildings), except that no such inspection is required of any unit the tenant or other lawful occupant of which does not permit such inspection to be conducted; and (3) that any such defects and other visible conditions found have been repaired. The warranties set forth in subsection (b) shall be applicable to any units and common elements that are located within a building containing or comprising one or more units that is not a conversion building. Otherwise, such declarant may offer the units, common elements or both in any conversion building in an \"as is\" condition. If any building containing or comprising units is a conversion building, then the warranty provisions of this subsection shall also apply to all common elements in the cooperative that are located outside of any conversion building and that are not located in a building containing one or more units that is not a conversion building. The declarant of a cooperative containing any conversion buildings may also give a more extensive warranty in writing. The times at which the warranties required by this subsection commence and the duration of such warranties shall be as provided in subsection (b). (d) Exclusion or modification of warranty.-- Except with respect to a purchaser of a unit for residential use, the warranty against structural defects: (1) may be excluded or modified by agreement of the parties; and (2) is excluded by expression of disclaimer, such as \"as is,\" \"with all faults\" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties. (e) Limitation of action.-- No action to enforce the warranty created by this section shall be commenced later than six years after the warranty begins, provided, however, that the limitation period affecting a right of action by the association under this section shall be six years after the warranty begins or two years after the unit owners elect an executive board under section 4303(f) (relating to executive board members and officers), whichever is later.

The attorneys for the Commonwealth may with the approval of the supervising judge disclose matters occurring before the investigating grand jury including transcripts of testimony to local, State, other state or Federal law enforcement or investigating agencies to assist them in investigating crimes under their investigative jurisdiction. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, operator of a recording device, or any typist who transcribes recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

(a) General rule.-- An employer shall not deprive an employee of his employment, seniority position or benefits, or threaten or otherwise coerce him with respect thereto, because the employee receives a summons, responds thereto, serves as a juror or attends court for prospective jury service. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the employer to compensate the employee for employment time lost because of such jury service. (b) Penalty.-- Any employer who violates subsection (a) commits a summary offense. (c) Civil remedy available.-- If an employer penalizes an employee in violation of subsection (a) the employee may bring a civil action for recovery of wages and benefits lost as a result of the violation and for an order requiring the reinstatement of the employee. Damages recoverable shall not exceed wages and benefits actually lost. If he prevails, the employee shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee fixed by the court. (d) Exception.-- Subsection (a) shall not apply to any employer in any retail or service industry employing fewer than 15 persons or any employer in any manufacturing industry employing fewer than 40 persons.

Failure to obtain a permit prior to the operation or movement of such a vehicle, combination or load shall subject the owner, lessee and operator of the vehicle or combination to the institution of summary criminal proceedings by citation for any violations of this part. (b) Limitations on local regulation.-- The maximum size and weight of vehicles specified in this chapter shall govern throughout this Commonwealth and local authorities shall have no power or authority to alter these limitations except as express authority may be granted in this title. (c) Permit authorizing prohibited movement.-- If an overweight or oversize movement cannot be made in any other feasible manner, the permit may authorize the movement to be made in contravention to any provision of this title provided that: (1) the department or local authority determines that the movement is in the public interest; and (2) the movement is escorted by certified escort vehicles as defined under section 3108 (relating to drivers of certified escort vehicles) or the Pennsylvania State Police and the following shall apply: (i) The department, in consultation with the Pennsylvania State Police, shall determine whether a Pennsylvania State Police escort is necessary. (ii) If it is jointly determined by the Pennsylvania State Police and the department that the movement must be escorted by the Pennsylvania State Police, the permittee shall bear the total costs of escorting the movement. (d) Responsibility of local authorities.-- Local authorities: (1) that have adopted an ordinance under this chapter; or (2) that establish or enforce size or weight limitations which differ from those provided for in this chapter; have the burden and responsibility to properly administer, adhere to and enforce compliance with the requirements of this chapter and the regulations of the department. Failure of a local authority to properly administer, adhere to or enforce the substantive requirements of this chapter and the department's regulations shall subject the local authority to penalties set forth under section 4907 (relating to penalty for violation of chapter).

(a) Restrictions based on condition of highway or bridge.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge only when they determine by conducting an engineering and traffic study as provided for in department regulations that the highway or bridge may be damaged or destroyed unless use by vehicles is prohibited or the permissible size or weight of vehicles is reduced. (2) School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (2.1) Government-owned vehicles, vehicles of local government agency contractors providing material for maintenance and department contractors engaged in or providing material for construction or maintenance shall be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways, except bridges, imposed under this subsection in accordance with department regulations. The following types of documents shall constitute evidence that a vehicle is traveling to or from a site in accordance with this paragraph: (i) A bill of lading. (ii) A shipping order. (iii) A service order or other document that indicates the address of the site and purpose of the trip. (3) The department may issue a statement of policy, which shall take effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, adopting an appropriate methodology to provide letters of local determination that identify particular vehicles, routes or uses as local in nature. (4) The methodology under paragraph (3) may allow for exemptions from 67 Pa. Code Ch. 189 (relating to hauling in excess of posted weight limit) related to the at-risk industry of logging or other forest products experiencing a 20% decline in Statewide employment between March 2002 and March 2011, as determined by the Department of Labor and Industry. (5) The exemptions and related requirements under paragraph (4) may remain in existence only until December 31, 2028. Exemptions for local delivery or pickup may not include traffic going to or coming from a site at which minerals, natural gas or natural resources are developed, harvested or extracted, notwithstanding whether the site is located at a residence, a commercial site or on farmland. Delivery or pickup of logs or other forest products to or from permanent processing mills located on or reachable only through posted highways shall be considered local delivery or pickup. Delivery or pickup of coal to or from permanent coal reprocessing or preparation plants located on or reachable only through posted highways and not on the same posted highway as a site at which coal is extracted shall be considered local delivery or pickup. (b) Restrictions based on traffic conditions.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge whenever they determine that hazardous traffic conditions or other safety factors require such a prohibition or restriction. School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (c) Permits and security.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities may issue permits for movement of vehicles of size and weight in excess of restrictions promulgated under subsections (a) and (b) with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdiction and may require such agreement or security as they deem necessary to cover the cost of repairs and restoration necessitated by the permitted movement of vehicles. In reference to subsection (a), the Commonwealth and local authorities shall not refuse to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction if there is no reasonable alternate route available. For purposes of this section, \"reasonable alternate route\" shall mean a route meeting the criteria set forth in department regulations relating to traffic and engineering studies. (2) The department may establish the types of permits to be issued and agreements to be entered into, subject to the following: (i) Permits may be for long-term or short-term use of the posted highways. (ii) The department may require multiple vehicles traveling to or from a single destination to operate pursuant to a single permit. (iii) The department may establish a permit type allowing the posting authority to determine that damage to the posted highway covered by the permit will be minimal. This type of permit may include categories based on the number and kinds of loads expected, including a category providing that use of the posted highway under a single minimum-use permit of less than 700 loads per year shall not require an agreement or security. The department may alter the 700 loads per year minimum-use threshold if it determines the structural capacity of the State highways can accept a higher or lower amount of over-posted weight traffic. The department may express the threshold as a loads-per-day, loads-per-week or loads-per-month number. (iv) The department may restrict use of de minimis and minimum-use permits during thaw periods as determined by the department. (v) The department shall exclude hauling related to unconventional oil and gas development from minimum-use status based on its disproportionate and qualitatively different impact upon highways and bridges. (3) The department shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. During the two years immediately following the effective date of this section, the department may promulgate temporary regulations, which shall expire no later than three years following the effective date of this paragraph or upon promulgation of final regulations, whichever occurs first. Temporary regulations promulgated by the department under this paragraph shall not be subject to any of the following: (i) Sections 201, 202 and 203 of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law. (ii) The Act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as the Regulatory Review Act. (d) Designation of alternate routes.-- (1) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsections (a) and (b), the Commonwealth may designate alternate routes for vehicles in excess of specified weights or sizes. Such alternate routes may utilize portions of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. (2) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsection (c), when refusing to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an alternate route study. The elements of an engineering and traffic study conducted to designate an alternate route pursuant to this section shall consist of the same elements found in department regulations. (e) Erection of signs.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities shall erect or cause to be erected and maintained restriction signs designating the restrictions within 25 feet of each end of a bridge or portion of highway restricted as provided in subsection (a) or (b). In the case of a restriction on a bridge or on a highway which does not begin or end at an intersection with an unrestricted highway, the Commonwealth or local authorities shall also place an advance informational sign at the intersection nearest each end of the restricted bridge or portion of highway which would allow drivers to avoid the restricted bridge or portion of highway. No person shall be convicted of violating subsection (a) or (b) unless the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the direction the person was driving was posted as required in this subsection. However, failure to post the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the opposite direction or failure to post any advance informational sign shall not constitute a defense to a violation of this section. (f) Actions to be in accordance with department regulations.-- All actions taken under authority of this section shall be taken in accordance with department regulations. (f.1) Local ordinances superseded.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, local authorities are prohibited from enacting or enforcing ordinances inconsistent with the provisions contained in this section.

(c) Acquisition of part of common facilities.-- If part of the common facilities is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the award attributable to the interest of the association in the common facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining common facilities among the unit owners in proportion to the common expense liability attributable to the units before the taking, but any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common facility shall be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that limited common facility was allocated at the time of acquisition or in any manner as provided in the declaration. (d) Acquisition of part of controlled facilities.-- If, as part of a unit acquired by eminent domain, controlled facilities are taken which benefit other units, that portion of the award attributable to the interest of the other units in the controlled facilities taken shall be paid to the association.

If a member elects to receive this previous State service credit, The Pennsylvania State University shall make employer contributions equal to the amount that would have been contributed had employer contributions been made to the system concurrently with the rendering of the service, plus valuation interest to the day of the crediting of the service. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the amount due as member contributions and interest for an employee who is employed by the Applied Research Laboratory on June 3, 1984, who elects to purchase this credit with the State Employees' Retirement System shall not exceed the amount of contributions and interest certified as having been made to the pension plan administered by the Applied Research Laboratory during his employment with the Applied Research Laboratory. The Pennsylvania State University shall pay as member contributions the difference between this amount and the amount otherwise due under sections 5504 and 5506. The additional contributions paid by The Pennsylvania State University shall not be considered compensation for purposes of this part. (d) Transfer of certain pension service credit.-- (1) Any person who was an employee of any county in this Commonwealth on the personal staff of an appellate court judge prior to September 9, 1985, and who had that employment transferred to the Commonwealth pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 3703 (relating to local chamber facilities) shall be a member of the system for all service rendered as an employee of the Commonwealth on the personal staff of an appellate court judge subsequent to the date of the transfer unless specifically prohibited pursuant to section 5301(c) (relating to mandatory and optional membership in the system and participation in the plan). The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service credit in that county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous county employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer, by the member, county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's county or municipal pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the county or municipal pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by December 31, 1987, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by December 31, 1987. If the amount transferred to the system by the member of a county or municipal pension plan or retirement system is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service in accordance with county or other municipal pension plan or retirement system benefit provisions, multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members. The Public Employee Retirement Study Commission shall determine the appropriate amount of employer contributions to be transferred to the system by the county or other municipal pension plans or retirement systems. (2) If the member died prior to the effective date of this subsection, the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1). In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by December 31, 1987. If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before January 1, 1988, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or request that the county or other municipal pension or retirement system make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by March 31, 1988. If the member dies after December 31, 1987, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (1), neither the member or his estate shall receive credit for the prior service. (e) Transfer and purchase of certain pension service credit; Philadelphia Regional Port Authority.-- (1) Any employee of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority who becomes a State employee, as defined in section 5102 (relating to definitions), and an active member of the system shall be eligible to obtain retirement credit for prior uncredited service with the Philadelphia Port Corporation, a Pennsylvania not-for-profit corporation (\"predecessor corporation\"), provided that the Commonwealth does not incur any liability for the funding of the annuities attributable to the prior, uncredited \"predecessor corporation\" service, the cost of which shall be determined according to paragraph (2). (2) The employee shall be entitled to have any prior service in the \"predecessor corporation\" transferred to the system and deemed to be State service for all purposes under this part. However, for those employees who were in continuous employment which commenced prior to July 22, 1983, the provisions of section 5505.1 shall not apply. The transfer of prior service credit to the system shall occur upon the transfer by the member or the \"predecessor corporation\" to the system of the amount of accumulated member contributions, pick-up contributions and credited interest standing in the employee's pension plan or retirement system account as of the date that these funds are transferred to the system. In the event that these funds have been refunded to the member, the transfer of service credit shall occur when the member transfers an amount equal to either the refund which the member received from the member's pension plan or retirement system or the amount due under section 5504, if less. In the case of a transfer by the member, the transfer shall occur by June 30, 1992, in order for the member to receive credit for the prior service. In the case of a transfer by the \"predecessor corporation\" pension plan or retirement system, the transfer shall also occur by June 30, 1992. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5504, the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall pay as pick-up contributions the difference between the amount credited to the member's account and the amount otherwise due under section 5504. Such additional contributions paid by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall not be considered compensation for the purposes of this part. If the amount transferred to the system by the member is greater than the amount that would have accumulated in the member's account if the employee had been a member of the system, all excess funds shall be returned to the employee within 90 days of the date on which such funds are credited to the member's account in the system. Within 60 days of receipt of written notice that an employee has elected to transfer credits under the provisions of this subsection, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system an amount, excluding contributions due under section 5504(a), equal to the liability of the prior service multiplied by the ratio of system actuarial value of assets for active members to the system actuarial accrued liability for active members so long as the amount to be transferred is equal to or less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee. In the event that the amount required to be transferred is greater than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee shall be transferred to the system, and the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority shall be required to transfer to the system the additional funds needed to satisfy the requirements of the calculation in this paragraph. If the amount required to be transferred is less than the total employer contributions made on behalf of the employee, the pension plan or retirement system in which the employee was enrolled prior to the creation of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority may retain the amount not needed for transfer. (3) If the member dies on or after the effective date of this subsection and before July 1, 1992, without making the transfer or requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), the personal representative for the estate of the member may make any transfer or may request that the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority make any transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service. In order to receive credit for the prior service, the transfer must be made by September 30, 1992. If the member dies after June 30, 1992, without making the transfer or without requesting the transfer necessary to receive credit for the prior service authorized in paragraph (2), neither the member nor his estate shall receive credit for the prior service. (4) Any person who became employed by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority between July 10, 1989, and passage of this act and who becomes a State employee, as defined in section 5102, and an active member of the system shall be eligible to obtain retirement credit for service from the date of employment with the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, provided that the contributions are made in accordance with sections 5501, 5504, 5505.1 and 5506.

(2) The employee shall elect to receive the credit by filing an application with the board while an active member no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act. (3) Contributions to be paid by an active member for credit for New Jersey State Police and the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Crime Law Enforcement Network service shall be sufficient to provide an amount equal to the regular and additional accumulated deductions which would have been standing to the credit of the member for such service had regular and additional member contributions been made to the board with full coverage as a Class A member during the period of New Jersey State Police and Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network service and had these regular and additional accumulated deductions been credited with statutory interest up to the date of purchase. The amount payable shall be certified in each case by the board in accordance with methods approved by the actuary and shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days or, in the case of an active member, may be amortized with statutory interest through salary deductions in amounts agreed upon by the member and the board and shall be credited to the members' savings account.

Contributions paid by the Office of Attorney General shall be made out of Regional Information Sharing Systems Program grants and Federal funds received from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, United States Department of Justice, and in no event shall the contributions be the obligation of any other fund of the Commonwealth. The contributions shall not be considered compensation for purposes of this part.

(a) General rule.-- In order to operate a limousine service within a city of the first class, the limousine service must have a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority under section 5741.1 (relating to power of authority). The authority may grant a certificate of public convenience to provide limousine service if the authority determines that the applicant is capable of providing safe, adequate, lawful and dependable service to the public. The authority may by regulation define categories of limousine service. The authority may separately grant certificates of public convenience for each category of limousine service and specify the rights associated with the certificates of public convenience by category of limousine service. (a.1) Advance reservation limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service within a city of the first class may transport persons and their baggage upon advance reservation: (1) between points in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued; (2) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point in this Commonwealth; (3) from any point in this Commonwealth to any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate issued; and (4) from any point in the city of the first class for which its certificate is issued to any point outside this Commonwealth as part of a continuous trip. (a.2) Other limousine service.-- A vehicle authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide nonexclusive, scheduled limousine service may transport persons and their baggage to or from any airport, railroad station or hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class without advance reservation in accordance with rules and regulations established by the authority. (a.3) Commission limousine certificate holders.-- A vehicle which is not authorized by a certificate of public convenience issued by the authority to provide limousine service in a city of the first class but which is operated by the holder of a certificate of public convenience from the commission authorizing limousine service elsewhere in this Commonwealth may transport persons and their baggage: (1) to a city of the first class upon advance reservation and in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience; and (2) from any point in a city of the first class to any point in this Commonwealth beyond the city of the first class upon advance reservation in accordance with the service authorized under its certificate of public convenience, excluding service from any airport, railroad station and hotel located in whole or in part in a city of the first class. (b) Enforcement.-- (1) The provisions of this subchapter and the rules and regulations promulgated by the authority pursuant to this subchapter shall be enforced within cities of the first class by authority personnel. (2) The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission may initiate actions before the authority. (c) Restrictions.-- (1) Certificates issued pursuant to this subchapter shall be nontransferable unless a transfer is approved by the authority. (2) A limousine service provider operating pursuant to an authority-issued certificate of public convenience and a filed tariff permitting the limousine service provider to charge mileage-based rates on the effective date of this paragraph shall be permitted to continue to charge mileage-based rates and to be regulated in the same manner as traditional limousine service providers. (d) Penalties involving certified limousines.-- Operating a certificated limousine in violation of this subchapter and authority regulations with regard to limousine service in a city of the first class or authorizing or permitting such operation is a nontraffic summary offense. Offenders may also be subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745 (relating to civil penalties). (e) Unauthorized vehicles.-- Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a limousine or giving the appearance of offering limousine service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience, is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each subsequent offense. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as a limousine without a certificate of public convenience are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5745. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund. (f) Confiscation and impoundment of vehicles.-- (1) In addition to penalties provided for in subsections (d) and (e), the authority is empowered to confiscate and impound vehicles and equipment which are utilized to provide limousine service without a proper certificate of public convenience in a city of the first class or which are in violation of regulations of the authority. Upon satisfaction of all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner or operator of the confiscated vehicle and equipment and payment of the authority's costs associated with confiscation and impoundment, the vehicle and equipment shall be returned to its registered owner or registered lienholder. (2) (i) If an owner or operator does not satisfy all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed within 45 days of the date of impoundment, the authority may publicly auction all confiscated property. (ii) The authority shall, at least 30 days before the date of the public auction, provide notice by regular mail to the registered owner and any registered lienholder of the public auction of confiscated vehicles and equipment. The notice required under this subparagraph may be provided within the period of 45 days of the date of impoundment. (3) The authority shall apply the proceeds from the sale of all confiscated property in the following order: (i) To the costs of the authority associated with the confiscation, impoundment and auction. (ii) To all penalties imposed and all outstanding fines assessed against the owner and operator of the confiscated property.

(v) When not claimed by any registered lienholder or registered owner within one year of the auction date, remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the fund.

(a) General rule.-- If a defendant in a criminal prosecution fails to appear for any scheduled court proceeding, the defendant's bail may be revoked and notice of revocation shall serve as notice of intent to forfeit the bail of the defendant. The notice or order of revocation shall be served by the office of the clerk to the defendant, surety or bail bondsman and insurer who has issued the qualifying power of attorney for the bail bondsman by certified mail, return receipt requested. (b) Payment.-- The following shall apply: (1) Ninety days from the date of the service of the notice of revocation or order of revocation, the revocation shall become a judgment of forfeiture, payment of which shall be immediately required by the defendant or surety. Failure of a bail bondsman to make a timely payment of a forfeiture judgment shall result in the district attorney or county solicitor commencing proceedings to suspend or nonrenew the license of the bail bondsman otherwise consistent with section 5746 (relating to suspension or revocation of authority to conduct business in a county). (2) Payment of forfeited undertaking shall be made directly to the office of the clerk not later than the close of business on the 91st day following the service of the notice of revocation. If the defendant has been recovered and placed into custody through the efforts of the bail bondsman or proof has been provided to the court that the defendant was discovered by the bail bondsman to be in custody in another jurisdiction prior to the 91st day, no payment of the forfeited undertaking shall be required. If the defendant is placed into custody or discovered to be in custody, the court shall set aside the bail revocation and may release the defendant with the reinstitution of bail pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. The bail bondsman shall not be continued by the court as surety on reinstated bail unless a written consent is signed by the bail bondsman agreeing to such extension of suretyship. (3) Failure to render payment of the forfeited undertaking by close of business on the 91st day shall bar any right of remission to collect funds pursuant to the forfeited undertaking. (4) The office of the clerk shall provide a summary quarterly statement of all overdue forfeited undertakings which have not been paid by each bail bondsman and insurer. The bail bondsman or insurer shall be afforded 30 days from the date of the statement to render payment of the forfeited undertakings. Failure to render payment by close of business on the 31st day shall result in suspension of the ability to conduct business of both the bail bondsman and the insurer in that judicial district until such time as payment is rendered in full. The bail bondsman may be subject to formal suspension or nonrenewal proceedings pursuant to section 5746. In addition, the insurer may be subjected to further administrative penalties, to be determined by the department, consistent with the act of July 22, 1974 (P.L.589, No.205), known as the Unfair Insurance Practices Act, or other applicable law. (5) If the defendant is recovered after the 91st day following the forfeiture, a surety may petition the court in which the revocation and forfeiture occurred to remit all or a portion of the funds collected in exchange for the absence of the defendant. The court shall remit payment as follows: (i) If the defendant is recovered between the 91st day and six months after the order of revocation or forfeiture, the surety shall recover the full value of the forfeited amount of the bond, less an administrative fee in the amount of $250. (ii) If the defendant is recovered between six months and one year after the order of revocation or forfeiture, the surety shall recover 80% of the value of the forfeited amount of the bond. (iii) If the defendant is recovered between one and two years after the order of revocation or forfeiture, the surety shall recover 50% of the value of the forfeited amount of the bond. (6) No third-party surety shall be responsible to render payment on a forfeited undertaking if the revocation of bail is sought for failure of the defendant to comply with the conditions of the defendant's release other than appearance. Any violation of performance conditions by a defendant shall be deemed as a violation of a court order, subject to a conviction for indirect contempt of court for violating a court order instituting terms and conditions of release of the defendant and all associated penalties.

(ii) Any funds received as a civil penalty under this paragraph must be retained and be used by the district attorney to provide victim services. (3) If the third-party surety is a bail bondsman and has been penalized under paragraph (2) for three or more violations in a two-year period, the attorney for the Commonwealth may commence an action to revoke the bail bondsman's ability to conduct business under section 5745 or 5746. (4) A civil penalty may not be assessed and a license suspension or revocation may not be imposed against a third-party surety for any of the following: (i) Failure to report a known violation under subsection (a), if the third-party surety provides evidence that the violation was reported to a law enforcement agency under subsection (b). (ii) Lack of knowledge of the bail conditions, if the third-party surety provides evidence that the third-party surety attempted to obtain information about the bail conditions which went unanswered or refused or that the bail conditions were altered subsequent to the defendant's release and the third-party surety lacked information about the amended conditions. (iii) Willful disregard to the safety of a witness, victim or the general public, if: (A) the third-party surety provides evidence that the third-party surety reviewed the bail conditions with the defendant within 24 hours of release and during instances of contact between the third-party surety and the defendant; and (B) if the defendant indicated a willingness to commit a violation under subsection (a), the third-party surety reported the risk to the attorney for the Commonwealth or the law enforcement agency, if the attorney for the Commonwealth is unavailable.

The regulations may divide the area into zones and, within the zones, specify the land uses permitted and regulate and restrict the height to which structures may be erected or objects of natural growth may be allowed to grow. A municipality which includes an airport hazard area created by the location of a public airport is required to adopt, administer and enforce zoning ordinances pursuant to this subchapter if the existing comprehensive zoning ordinance for the municipality does not provide for the land uses permitted and regulate and restrict the height to which structures may be erected or objects of natural growth may be allowed to grow in an airport hazard area. (b) Joint airport zoning board.-- Where any airport hazard area appertaining to an airport is located outside the territorial limits of the municipality encompassing the airport, all of the municipalities involved may, by ordinance or resolution, create a joint airport zoning board which shall have the same power to adopt, administer and enforce airport zoning regulations applicable to the airport hazard area in question as that vested by subsection (a) in the municipality within which the area is located. Each joint airport zoning board shall have as members two representatives appointed by each municipality participating in its creation and, in addition, a chairman elected by a majority of the members so appointed. (c) Definition.-- As used in this section the word \"airport\" does not include facilities designated as heliports and which can be used only by rotary wing aircraft, nor airports which are private airports.

An increase beyond that amount shall require a written amendment to the existing rental facility agreement signed by the parties to the rental facility agreement or the parties' successors or assigns. (c) Rental facility agreement.-- (1) A rental facility agreement shall take effect and be enforceable if, at the time it is executed, it is signed by the airport owner and at least 80% of the vehicle rental companies which utilized airport property and which together provided at least 90% of the motor vehicle rentals utilizing airport property in the most recently completed calendar year. (2) The terms of a rental facility agreement may be interpreted and enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction through the imposition of a mandatory or prohibitive injunction.

(d) Limitations.-- (1) Notwithstanding the authorization for the use of the proceeds of the customer facility charge under subsection (g) and except as provided in paragraph (2), until a rental facility agreement is executed, the proceeds of the customer facility charge may be used only for planning, design, feasibility studies and other preliminary expenses necessary for the uses authorized in subsection (g). (2) If a rental facility agreement is not executed within two years following the date a vehicle rental company is required to begin collecting the customer facility charge, a city may continue to impose and collect the customer facility charge authorized under this section after notice to the vehicle rental companies. The city may use the proceeds of the customer facility charge in the manner authorized by subsection (g) except that any expenses imposed on vehicle rental companies may not exceed the proceeds of the customer facility charge.

(2) With any Federal agency that, if the Federal agency contributes funds to support any projects needed for the implementation of this subchapter, the Commonwealth will not alter or limit the rights and powers of the airport owner in a manner which would be inconsistent with the due performance of any agreement between the airport owner and a Federal agency of which the Commonwealth has knowledge.

Except as provided in subsection (f), if the hearing is not held within such time, the child shall be immediately released from detention or shelter care.

(2) Directing the person having the physical custody or control of the child to bring the child to the hearing. (c) Warrant of arrest.-- If it appears from affidavit filed or from sworn testimony before the court that the conduct, condition, or surroundings of the child are endangering his health or welfare or those of others, or that he may abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court or will not be brought before the court notwithstanding the service of the summons, the court may issue a warrant of arrest. (d) Form.-- A summons and warrant of arrest shall be in such form and shall be served as prescribed by general rules. (e) Waiver of service.-- A party, other than the child, may waive service of summons by written stipulation or by voluntary appearance at the hearing.

(f) Limitations on release.-- The child shall not be released from detention or shelter care under authority of subsection (a) if the failure to hold a hearing within ten days after the filing of the petition is the result of delay caused by the child. Delay caused by the child shall include, but not be limited to: (1) Delay caused by the unavailability of the child or his attorney. (2) Delay caused by any continuance granted at the request of the child or his attorney. (3) Delay caused by the unavailability of a witness resulting from conduct by or on behalf of the child. At the conclusion of any court proceeding in which the scheduled hearing is not held, the court shall state on the record whether the failure to hold the hearing resulted from delay caused by the child.

(b) Objection.-- Where the child or the district attorney objects to a consent decree, the court shall proceed to findings, adjudication and disposition. (c) Duration of decree.-- A consent decree shall remain in force for six months unless the child is discharged sooner by probation services with the approval of the court. Upon application of the probation services or other agency supervising the child, made before expiration of the six-month period, a consent decree may be extended by the court for an additional six months. (c.1) Terms and conditions.-- Consistent with the protection of the public interest, the terms and conditions of a consent decree may include payment by the child of reasonable amounts of money as costs, fees or restitution, including a supervision fee and contribution to a restitution fund established by the president judge of the court of common pleas pursuant to section 6352(a)(5) (relating to disposition of delinquent child), and shall, as appropriate to the circumstances of each case, include provisions which provide balanced attention to the protection of the community, accountability for offenses committed and the development of competencies to enable the child to become a responsible and productive member of the community. (d) Reinstatement of petition.-- If prior to discharge by the probation services or expiration of the consent decree, a new petition is filed against the child, or the child otherwise fails to fulfill express terms and conditions of the decree, the petition under which the child was continued under supervision may, in the discretion of the district attorney following consultation with the probation services, be reinstated and the child held accountable as if the consent decree had never been entered. (e) Effect of decree.-- A child who is discharged by the probation services, or who completes a period of supervision without reinstatement of the original petition, shall not again be proceeded against in any court for the same offense alleged in the petition or an offense based upon the same conduct. (f) Expungement of records.-- Upon motion, or sua sponte, including upon receiving notice under section 6304(a.2) (relating to powers and duties of probation officers), the court shall commence expungement proceedings under 18 Pa.C.S. § 9123 (relating to juvenile records) and the Pennsylvania Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure if the court finds: (1) six months have elapsed since the child's successful discharge from consent decree supervision; and (2) no proceeding seeking adjudication or conviction is pending.

(a) General rule.-- If the child is found to be a dependent child the court may make any of the following orders of disposition best suited to the safety, protection and physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child: (1) Permit the child to remain with his parents, guardian, or other custodian, subject to conditions and limitations as the court prescribes, including supervision as directed by the court for the protection of the child. (2) Subject to conditions and limitations as the court prescribes transfer temporary legal custody to any of the following: (i) Any individual resident within or without this Commonwealth, including any relative, who, after study by the probation officer or other person or agency designated by the court, is found by the court to be qualified to receive and care for the child. (ii) An agency or other private organization licensed or otherwise authorized by law to receive and provide care for the child. (iii) A public agency authorized by law to receive and provide care for the child. (2.1) Subject to conditions and limitations as the court prescribes, transfer permanent legal custody to an individual resident in or outside this Commonwealth, including any relative, who, after study by the probation officer or other person or agency designated by the court, is found by the court to be qualified to receive and care for the child. A court order under this paragraph may set forth the temporary visitation rights of the parents. The court shall refer issues related to support and continuing visitation by the parent to the section of the court of common pleas that regularly determines support and visitation. (3) Without making any of the foregoing orders transfer custody of the child to the juvenile court of another state if authorized by and in accordance with section 6363 (relating to ordering foreign supervision). (b) Required preplacement findings.-- Prior to entering any order of disposition under subsection (a) that would remove a dependent child from his home, the court shall enter findings on the record or in the order of court as follows: (1) that continuation of the child in his home would be contrary to the welfare, safety or health of the child; and (2) whether reasonable efforts were made prior to the placement of the child to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, if the child has remained in his home pending such disposition; or (3) if preventive services were not offered due to the necessity for an emergency placement, whether such lack of services was reasonable under the circumstances; or (4) if the court has previously determined pursuant to section 6332 (relating to informal hearing) that reasonable efforts were not made to prevent the initial removal of the child from his home, whether reasonable efforts are under way to make it possible for the child to return home; and (5) if the child has a sibling who is subject to removal from his home, whether reasonable efforts were made prior to the placement of the child to place the siblings together or whether such joint placement is contrary to the safety or well-being of the child or sibling. The court shall not enter findings under paragraph (2), (3) or (4) if the court previously determined that aggravated circumstances exist and no new or additional reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing the child from the home or to preserve and reunify the family are required. (b.1) Visitation for child and sibling.-- If a sibling of a child has been removed from his home and is in a different placement setting than the child, the court shall enter an order that ensures visitation between the child and the child's sibling no less than twice a month, unless a finding is made that visitation is contrary to the safety or well-being of the child or sibling. (c) Limitation on confinement.-- Unless a child found to be dependent is found also to be delinquent he shall not be committed to or confined in an institution or other facility designed or operated for the benefit of delinquent children. (d) County programs.-- Every county of this Commonwealth shall develop programs for children under paragraph (5) or (6) of the definition of \"dependent child\" in section 6302 (relating to definitions). (e) Permanency hearings.-- (1) The court shall conduct a permanency hearing for the purpose of determining or reviewing the permanency plan of the child, the date by which the goal of permanency for the child might be achieved and whether placement continues to be best suited to the safety, protection and physical, mental and moral welfare of the child. In any permanency hearing held with respect to the child, the court shall consult with the child regarding the child's permanency plan, including the child's desired permanency goal, in a manner appropriate to the child's age and maturity. If the court does not consult personally with the child, the court shall ensure that the views of the child regarding the permanency plan have been ascertained to the fullest extent possible and communicated to the court by the guardian ad litem under section 6311 (relating to guardian ad litem for child in court proceedings) or, as appropriate to the circumstances of the case by the child's counsel, the court-appointed special advocate or other person as designated by the court. (2) If the county agency or the child's attorney alleges the existence of aggravated circumstances and the court determines that the child has been adjudicated dependent, the court shall then determine if aggravated circumstances exist. If the court finds from clear and convincing evidence that aggravated circumstances exist, the court shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing the child from the child's parent, guardian or custodian or to preserve and reunify the family shall be made or continue to be made and schedule a hearing as provided in paragraph (3). (3) The court shall conduct permanency hearings as follows: (i) Within six months of: (A) the date of the child's removal from the child's parent, guardian or custodian for placement under section 6324 (relating to taking into custody) or 6332 or pursuant to a transfer of temporary legal custody or other disposition under subsection (a)(2), whichever is the earliest; or (B) each previous permanency hearing until the child is returned to the child's parent, guardian or custodian or removed from the jurisdiction of the court. (ii) Within 30 days of: (A) an adjudication of dependency at which the court determined that aggravated circumstances exist and that reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the child's parent, guardian or custodian or to preserve and reunify the family need not be made or continue to be made; (B) a permanency hearing at which the court determined that aggravated circumstances exist and that reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the child's parent, guardian or custodian or to preserve and reunify the family need not be made or continue to be made and the permanency plan for the child is incomplete or inconsistent with the court's determination; (C) an allegation that aggravated circumstances exist regarding a child who has been adjudicated dependent, filed under section 6334(b) (relating to petition); or (D) a petition alleging that the hearing is necessary to protect the safety or physical, mental or moral welfare of a dependent child. (iii) If the court resumes jurisdiction of the child pursuant to subsection (j), permanency hearings shall be scheduled in accordance with applicable law until court jurisdiction is terminated, but no later than when the child attains 21 years of age. (f) Matters to be determined at permanency hearing.-- At each permanency hearing, a court shall determine all of the following: (1) The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement. (2) The appropriateness, feasibility and extent of compliance with the permanency plan developed for the child. (3) The extent of progress made toward alleviating the circumstances which necessitated the original placement. (4) The appropriateness and feasibility of the current placement goal for the child. (5) The likely date by which the placement goal for the child might be achieved. (5.1) Whether reasonable efforts were made to finalize the permanency plan in effect. (6) Whether the child is safe. (7) If the child has been placed outside the Commonwealth, whether the placement continues to be best suited to the safety, protection and physical, mental and moral welfare of the child. (8) The services needed to assist a child who is 14 years of age or older to make the transition to successful adulthood and whether the services are being provided as required under 67 Pa.C.S. § 7505 (relating to transition plan and services). (8.1) Whether the child continues to meet the definition of \"child\" and has requested that the court continue jurisdiction pursuant to section 6302 if the child is between 18 and 21 years of age. (8.2) If the child is 18 years of age or older, whether a suitable transition plan has been presented in accordance with section 475 of the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(H)) and 67 Pa.C.S. § 7505. (9) If the child has been in placement for at least 15 of the last 22 months or the court has determined that aggravated circumstances exist and that reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the child's parent, guardian or custodian or to preserve and reunify the family need not be made or continue to be made, whether the county agency has filed or sought to join a petition to terminate parental rights and to identify, recruit, process and approve a qualified family to adopt the child unless: (i) the child is being cared for by a relative best suited to the physical, mental and moral welfare of the child; (ii) the county agency has documented a compelling reason for determining that filing a petition to terminate parental rights would not serve the needs and welfare of the child; or (iii) the child's family has not been provided with necessary services to achieve the safe return to the child's parent, guardian or custodian within the time frames set forth in the permanency plan. (10) If a sibling of a child has been removed from his home and is in a different placement setting than the child, whether reasonable efforts have been made to place the child and the sibling of the child together or whether such joint placement is contrary to the safety or well-being of the child or sibling. (11) If the child has a sibling, whether visitation of the child with that sibling is occurring no less than twice a month, unless a finding is made that visitation is contrary to the safety or well-being of the child or sibling. (12) If the child has been placed with a caregiver, whether the child is being provided with regular, ongoing opportunities to participate in age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate activities. In order to make the determination under this paragraph, the county agency shall document the steps it has taken to ensure that: (i) the caregiver is following the reasonable and prudent parent standard; and (ii) the child has regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate activities. The county agency shall consult with the child regarding opportunities to engage in such activities. For children placed in foster care on or before November 19, 1997, the county agency shall file or join a petition for termination of parental rights under this subsection in accordance with section 103(c)(2) of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-89, 111 Stat. 2119). (f.1) Additional determination.-- Based upon the determinations made under subsection (f) and all relevant evidence presented at the hearing, the court shall determine one of the following: (1) If and when the child will be returned to the child's parent, guardian or custodian in cases where the return of the child is best suited to the safety, protection and physical, mental and moral welfare of the child. (2) If and when the child will be placed for adoption, and the county agency will file for termination of parental rights in cases where return to the child's parent, guardian or custodian is not best suited to the safety, protection and physical, mental and moral welfare of the child. (3) If and when the child will be placed with a legal custodian in cases where the return to the child's parent, guardian or custodian or being placed for adoption is not best suited to the safety, protection and physical, mental and moral welfare of the child. (4) If and when the child will be placed with a fit and willing relative in cases where return to the child's parent, guardian or custodian, being placed for adoption or being placed with a legal custodian is not best suited to the safety, protection and physical, mental and moral welfare of the child. (5) If and when the child will be placed in another planned permanent living arrangement which is approved by the court, the following shall apply: (i) The child must be 18 years of age or older. (ii) The county agency shall identify at least two significant connections with supportive adults willing to be involved in the child's life as the child transitions to adulthood, or document that efforts have been made to identify supportive adults. (iii) The county agency shall document: (A) A compelling reason that it would not be best suited to the safety, protection and physical, mental and moral welfare of the child to be returned to the child's parent, guardian or custodian, to be placed for adoption, to be placed with a legal custodian or to be placed with a fit and willing relative. (B) Its intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing, unsuccessful efforts to return the child to the child's parent, guardian or custodian or to be placed for adoption, to be placed with a legal custodian or to be placed with a fit and willing relative. (C) Its efforts to utilize search technology to find biological family members for the child. (iv) The court shall: (A) Ask the child about the desired permanency goal for the child.

(D) Make findings that the significant connections are identified in the permanency plan or that efforts have been made to identify at least two connections with supportive adults, if no one is currently identified.

(a) General rule.-- If the child is found to be a delinquent child the court may make any of the following orders of disposition determined to be consistent with the protection of the public interest and best suited to the child's treatment, supervision, rehabilitation and welfare, which disposition shall, as appropriate to the individual circumstances of the child's case, provide balanced attention to the protection of the community, the imposition of accountability for offenses committed and the development of competencies to enable the child to become a responsible and productive member of the community: (1) Any order authorized by section 6351 (relating to disposition of dependent child). (2) Placing the child on probation under supervision of the probation officer of the court or the court of another state as provided in section 6363 (relating to ordering foreign supervision), under conditions and limitations the court prescribes. (3) Committing the child to an institution, youth development center, camp, or other facility for delinquent children operated under the direction or supervision of the court or other public authority and approved by the Department of Public Welfare. (4) If the child is 12 years of age or older, committing the child to an institution operated by the Department of Public Welfare. (5) Ordering payment by the child of reasonable amounts of money as fines, costs, fees or restitution as deemed appropriate as part of the plan of rehabilitation considering the nature of the acts committed and the earning capacity of the child, including a contribution to a restitution fund. The president judge of the court of common pleas shall establish a restitution fund for the deposit of all contributions to the restitution fund which are received or collected. The president judge of the court of common pleas shall promulgate written guidelines for the administration of the fund. Disbursements from the fund shall be made, subject to the written guidelines and the limitations of this chapter, at the discretion of the president judge and used to reimburse crime victims for financial losses resulting from delinquent acts. For an order made under this subsection, the court shall retain jurisdiction until there has been full compliance with the order or until the delinquent child attains 21 years of age. Any restitution order which remains unpaid at the time the child attains 21 years of age shall continue to be collectible under section 9728 (relating to collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties). (6) An order of the terms of probation may include an appropriate fine considering the nature of the act committed or restitution not in excess of actual damages caused by the child which shall be paid from the earnings of the child received through participation in a constructive program of service or education acceptable to the victim and the court whereby, during the course of such service, the child shall be paid not less than the minimum wage of this Commonwealth. In ordering such service, the court shall take into consideration the age, physical and mental capacity of the child and the service shall be designed to impress upon the child a sense of responsibility for the injuries caused to the person or property of another. The order of the court shall be limited in duration consistent with the limitations in section 6353 (relating to limitation on and change in place of commitment and disposition review hearing) and in the act of May 13, 1915 (P.L.286, No.177), known as the Child Labor Law. The court order shall specify the nature of the work, the number of hours to be spent performing the assigned tasks, and shall further specify that as part of a plan of treatment and rehabilitation that up to 75% of the earnings of the child be used for restitution in order to provide positive reinforcement for the work performed. In selecting from the alternatives set forth in this section, the court shall follow the general principle that the disposition imposed should provide the means through which the provisions of this chapter are executed and enforced consistent with section 6301(b) (relating to purposes) and when confinement is necessary, the court shall impose the minimum amount of confinement that is consistent with the protection of the public and the rehabilitation needs of the child. (b) Limitation on place of commitment.-- A child shall not be committed or transferred to a penal institution or other facility used primarily for the execution of sentences of adults convicted of a crime. (c) Required statement of reasons.-- Prior to entering an order of disposition under subsection (a), the court shall state its disposition and the reasons for its disposition on the record in open court, together with the goals, terms and conditions of that disposition. If the child is to be committed to out-of-home placement, the court shall also state the name of the specific facility or type of facility to which the child will be committed and its findings and conclusions of law that formed the basis of its decision consistent with subsection (a) and section 6301, including the reasons why commitment to that facility or type of facility was determined to be the least restrictive placement that is consistent with the protection of the public and best suited to the child's treatment, supervision, rehabilitation and welfare. (d) Expungement of records.-- Upon motion, or sua sponte, including upon receiving notice under section 6304(a.2) (relating to powers and duties of probation officers), the court shall commence expungement proceedings under 18 Pa.C.S. § 9123 (relating to juvenile records) and the Pennsylvania Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure if the court finds: (1) two years have elapsed since the final discharge of a child from commitment, placement, probation or any other disposition and referral, pursuant to an adjudication of delinquency following a determination by the court that the child committed an offense classified as a misdemeanor, other than a misdemeanor under 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 61 (relating to firearms and other dangerous articles) or a misdemeanor under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3126(a)(2) or (3) (relating to indecent assault), and since the final discharge, the individual has not been convicted of a felony, misdemeanor or adjudicated delinquent and no proceeding is pending seeking a conviction or adjudication; (2) five years have elapsed since the final discharge of a child from commitment, placement, probation or any other disposition and referral, pursuant to an adjudication of delinquency following a determination by the court that the child committed an offense classified as a felony, an offense classified as a misdemeanor under 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 61 or an offense classified as a misdemeanor under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3126(a)(2) or (3), with the exception of an offense precluded from expungement under 18 Pa.C.S. § 9123(a.1), and since the final discharge, the individual has not been convicted of a felony, misdemeanor or adjudicated delinquent and no proceeding is pending seeking the conviction or adjudication; or (3) the attorney for the Commonwealth consents to the expungement, unless the offense committed by the juvenile is precluded from expungement under 18 Pa.C.S. § 9123(a.1).

(a) General rule.-- After a petition has been filed alleging delinquency based on conduct which is designated a crime or public offense under the laws, including local ordinances, of this Commonwealth, the court before hearing the petition on its merits may rule that this chapter is not applicable and that the offense should be prosecuted, and transfer the offense, where appropriate, to the division or a judge of the court assigned to conduct criminal proceedings, for prosecution of the offense if all of the following exist: (1) The child was 14 or more years of age at the time of the alleged conduct. (2) A hearing on whether the transfer should be made is held in conformity with this chapter. (3) Notice in writing of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing is given to the child and his parents, guardian, or other custodian at least three days before the hearing. (4) The court finds: (i) that there is a prima facie case that the child committed the delinquent act alleged; (ii) that the delinquent act would be considered a felony if committed by an adult; (iii) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the public interest is served by the transfer of the case for criminal prosecution. In determining whether the public interest can be served, the court shall consider the following factors: (A) the impact of the offense on the victim or victims; (B) the impact of the offense on the community; (C) the threat to the safety of the public or any individual posed by the child; (D) the nature and circumstances of the offense allegedly committed by the child; (E) the degree of the child's culpability; (F) the adequacy and duration of dispositional alternatives available under this chapter and in the adult criminal justice system; and (G) whether the child is amenable to treatment, supervision or rehabilitation as a juvenile by considering the following factors: (I) age; (II) mental capacity; (III) maturity; (IV) the degree of criminal sophistication exhibited by the child; (V) previous records, if any; (VI) the nature and extent of any prior delinquent history, including the success or failure of any previous attempts by the juvenile court to rehabilitate the child; (VII) whether the child can be rehabilitated prior to the expiration of the juvenile court jurisdiction; (VIII) probation or institutional reports, if any; (IX) any other relevant factors; and (iv) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the child is not committable to an institution for the mentally retarded or mentally ill. (b) Chapter inapplicable following transfer.-- The transfer terminates the applicability of this chapter over the child with respect to the delinquent acts alleged in the petition. (c) Transfer at request of child.-- The child may request that the case be transferred for prosecution in which event the court may order this chapter not applicable. (d) Effect of transfer from criminal proceedings.-- No hearing shall be conducted where this chapter becomes applicable because of a previous determination by the court in a criminal proceeding. (e) Murder and other excluded acts.-- Where the petition alleges conduct which if proven would constitute murder, or any of the offenses excluded by paragraph (2)(ii) or (iii) of the definition of \"delinquent act\" in section 6302 (relating to definitions), the court shall require the offense to be prosecuted under the criminal law and procedures, except where the case has been transferred pursuant to section 6322 (relating to transfer from criminal proceedings) from the division or a judge of the court assigned to conduct criminal proceedings. (f) Transfer action interlocutory.-- The decision of the court to transfer or not to transfer the case shall be interlocutory. (g) Burden of proof.-- The burden of establishing by a preponderance of evidence that the public interest is served by the transfer of the case to criminal court and that a child is not amenable to treatment, supervision or rehabilitation as a juvenile shall rest with the Commonwealth unless the following apply: (1) (i) a deadly weapon as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2301 (relating to definitions) was used and the child was 14 years of age at the time of the offense; or (ii) the child was 15 years of age or older at the time of the offense and was previously adjudicated delinquent of a crime that would be considered a felony if committed by an adult; and (2) there is a prima facie case that the child committed a delinquent act which, if committed by an adult, would be classified as rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated assault as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1) or (2) (relating to aggravated assault), robbery as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3701(a)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) (relating to robbery), robbery of motor vehicle, aggravated indecent assault, kidnapping, voluntary manslaughter, an attempt, conspiracy or solicitation to commit any of these crimes or an attempt to commit murder as specified in paragraph (2)(ii) of the definition of \"delinquent act\" in section 6302. If either of the preceding criteria are met, the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that retaining the case under this chapter serves the public interest and that the child is amenable to treatment, supervision or rehabilitation as a juvenile shall rest with the child.

      "text": "§ 6602. Prisoner filing fees. (a) Prisoner filing requirements.-- (1) A prisoner seeking to bring prison conditions litigation without the prepayment of fees or security due to indigency must submit a request to the court to proceed without the prepayment of fees. The request must include a certified copy of the prisoner's prison account statement, which shall be provided by the prison, for the six-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal. The request shall include a statement of any other assets of the prisoner. (2) The court shall deny in forma pauperis status to any prisoner where: (i) the request is not accompanied by a certified copy as provided in paragraph (1); (ii) the average monthly deposits or average highest monthly balance for the six-month period preceding the filing of the action exceeds the amount of the filing fee; or (iii) other grounds exist for the denial of in forma pauperis status pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. (b) Partial filing fees.-- (1) The court may grant in forma pauperis status to excuse the prisoner from paying the full filing fee prior to the initiation of the action or appeal. Where in forma pauperis status is granted, the court shall order the prisoner to pay the full amount of the filing fee and shall assess and, when funds exist, collect a full or partial payment of the filing fee which shall be the greater of the following: (i) The average monthly deposits to the prisoner's account. (ii) The average highest monthly balance in the prisoner's account for the six-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal requiring the payment of a fee. (2) The court shall send a copy of the assessment order to the prisoner, the parties to the action and the prison having custody of the prisoner. The court may also direct upon condition of maintaining the action that the prisoner make a written request to the prison officials to deduct payments required by the court. (3) The court may modify the assessment order for cause. (c) Payment of filing fees.-- Following payment of an initial partial filing fee, the prisoner shall make monthly payments of 20% of the preceding month's income credited to the prisoner's account. The prison having custody of the prisoner shall deduct payments from the prisoner's account when the prisoner's account balance exceeds $10 until the filing fees are paid in full. The prison shall forward to the prothonotary the deducted payments upon deduction, on a monthly basis, or upon complete payment of the full filing fee if the court so directs. The Department of Corrections and county prison systems shall develop written guidelines regarding the priority of payment, which shall be consistent with law. (d) Implementation of filing fee assessments.-- (1) A prisoner shall not be prohibited from filing prison conditions litigation because the prisoner has no assets or other means to pay the filing fee. This paragraph shall not prevent the court from dismissing or otherwise disposing of prison conditions litigation pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law. (2) No sooner than 60 days after notice of the denial in forma pauperis status or the assessment of partial filing fees, the prothonotary shall enter a judgment of non pros in the action or strike the appeal if the fees remain unpaid. The action or appeal may be reinstated by the court for good cause shown. (e) Dismissal of litigation.-- Notwithstanding any filing fee which has been paid, the court shall dismiss prison conditions litigation at any time, including prior to service on the defendant, if the court determines any of the following: (1) The allegation of indigency is untrue. (2) The prison conditions litigation is frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or the defendant is entitled to assert a valid affirmative defense, including immunity, which, if asserted, would preclude the relief. The court may reinstate the prison conditions litigation where the dismissal is based upon an untrue allegation of indigency and the prisoner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the untrue information was not known to the prisoner. (f) Abusive litigation.-- If the prisoner has previously filed prison conditions litigation and: (1) three or more of these prior civil actions have been dismissed pursuant to subsection (e)(2); or (2) the prisoner has previously filed prison conditions litigation against a person named as a defendant in the instant action or a person serving in the same official capacity as a named defendant and a court made a finding that the prior action was filed in bad faith or that the prisoner knowingly presented false evidence or testimony at a hearing or trial; the court may dismiss the action. The court shall not, however, dismiss a request for preliminary injunctive relief or a temporary restraining order which makes a credible allegation that the prisoner is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury.

The government party with jurisdiction over the prison subject to the prisoner release order or the prosecution or custody of persons who may be released from prison as a result of a prisoner release order shall have standing to intervene in any related proceeding and to oppose the imposition or continuation of the order and to seek termination of the order.

The Interstate Corrections Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this State with any other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: INTERSTATE CORRECTIONS COMPACT ARTICLE I Purpose and Policy The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had. (c) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had. (d) \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution. (e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including, but not limited to, a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined. ARTICLE III Contracts (a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration. 2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance. 3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any, the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom. 4. Delivery and retaking of inmates. 5. Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states. (b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith. ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights (a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. (b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. (c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III. (d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state. (e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state. (f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. (g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory. (h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state. (i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact. ARTICLE V Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition (a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference. (b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VI Federal Aid Any state party to this compact may accept Federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such Federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provisions, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor. ARTICLE VII Entry into Force This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state. ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact. ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements. ARTICLE X Construction and Severability The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",

The authority conferred upon the arbitrator includes the power to hold conferences with the parties to the arbitration proceeding before the hearing and, among other matters, determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence. (b) Summary disposition.-- An arbitrator may decide a request for summary disposition of a claim or particular issue: (1) if all interested parties agree; or (2) upon request of one party to the arbitration proceeding if that party gives notice to all other parties to the proceeding and if the other parties have a reasonable opportunity to respond. (c) Notice and hearing.-- If an arbitrator orders a hearing, the arbitrator shall set a time and place and give notice of the hearing not less than five days before the hearing begins. Unless a party to the arbitration proceeding makes an objection to lack or insufficiency of notice not later than the beginning of the hearing, the party's appearance at the hearing waives the objection. Upon request of a party to the arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, or upon the arbitrator's own initiative, the arbitrator may adjourn the hearing as necessary but may not postpone the hearing to a time later than that fixed by the agreement to arbitrate for making the award unless the parties to the arbitration proceeding consent to a later date. The arbitrator may hear and decide the controversy upon the evidence produced although a party who was notified of the arbitration proceeding did not appear. The court, on request, may direct the arbitrator to conduct the hearing promptly and render a timely decision. (d) Procedure.-- At a hearing under subsection (c), a party to the arbitration proceeding has a right to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing. (e) Replacement.-- If an arbitrator ceases or is unable to act during the arbitration proceeding, a replacement arbitrator must be appointed in accordance with section 7321.12 (relating to appointment of arbitrator; service as a neutral arbitrator) to continue the proceeding and to resolve the controversy. (f) Location for arbitration hearing for consumer transactions.-- A hearing conducted under an arbitration agreement applicable to a consumer transaction shall be held at a location reasonably convenient to the consumer.

(a) Civil liability.-- An arbitrator or arbitration organization acting in that capacity in a family law dispute is immune from civil liability to the same extent as a judge of a court of this Commonwealth acting in a judicial capacity. (b) Sovereign immunity.-- The immunity provided by this section supplements immunity under: (1) 1 Pa.C.S. § 2310 (relating to sovereign immunity reaffirmed; specific waiver); and (2) Subchapter B of Chapter 85 (relating to actions against Commonwealth parties). (c) Nondisclosure.-- An arbitrator's failure to make a disclosure under section 7379 (relating to disclosure by arbitrator and disqualification) does not cause the arbitrator to lose immunity under this section. (d) Testimony.-- (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (2), an arbitrator is not competent to testify, and may not be required to produce records, in a judicial, administrative or similar proceeding about a statement, conduct, decision or ruling occurring during an arbitration, to the same extent as a judge of a court of this Commonwealth acting in a judicial capacity. (2) This subsection does not apply: (i) to the extent disclosure is necessary to determine a claim by the arbitrator or arbitration organization against a party to the arbitration; or (ii) to a hearing on a motion under section 7389(a)(1) or (2) (relating to vacation, amendment or confirmation by court of unconfirmed award) if there is prima facie evidence that a ground for vacating the award exists. (e) Attorney fees and costs.-- If a person commences a civil action against an arbitrator arising from the services of the arbitrator or seeks to compel the arbitrator to testify or produce records in violation of subsection (d) and the court determines that the arbitrator is immune from civil liability or is not competent to testify or required to produce the records, the court shall award the arbitrator reasonable attorney fees and costs.",

(2) If a party discloses a privileged collaborative communication that prejudices another party, the disclosing party waives the right to assert a privilege under this section to the extent necessary for the party prejudiced to respond to the disclosure or representation. (c) Nonapplicability.-- Privilege under subsection (a) shall not apply to: (1) A communication that is not subject to the privilege by agreement of the parties according to the terms of a participation agreement. (2) A communication that is made during a session of a collaborative law process that is open, or required by law to be open, to the public. (3) A communication sought, obtained or used to: (i) threaten or plan to inflict bodily injury, commit or attempt to commit a crime; or (ii) conceal ongoing criminal activity.

(2) A communication sought or offered to prove facts relating to the abuse, neglect, abandonment or exploitation of a child or abuse of an adult. (3) A communication sought or offered in a criminal proceeding or in an action to enforce, void, set aside or modify a settlement agreement where a tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction finds that the evidence is not otherwise available and the need for the evidence substantially outweighs the interest in protecting the privilege. (e) Limitation.-- (1) If a collaborative communication is subject to an exception under subsection (d), only the part of the collaborative communication necessary for the application of the exception may be disclosed or admitted. (2) Disclosure or admission of evidence under subsection (d) does not make the evidence or any other collaborative communication discoverable or admissible for any other purpose.

The following interpleader compact is hereby approved, ratified, adopted and entered into by this Commonwealth as a party to take effect between this Commonwealth and any other state of the United States of America when entered into in accordance with the terms of the compact by the other state and not disapproved by the Governor under paragraph (c) of Article 7 of the compact: The Interpleader Compact The contracting states solemnly agree: Article 1. Purpose.--The aims of this compact are to promote comity and judicial cooperation among the states party thereto; and to relieve from undue risk and uncertainty, a person who may be subject to double or multiple liability because of the existence of adverse claimants, one or more of whom in the absence of this compact may not be subject to the jurisdiction of the adjudicating court, when such person makes all reasonable efforts to secure judicial determination and discharge of his liability. Article 2. Definitions.--For the purpose of this compact the following definitions shall apply: (a) A state shall mean (1) a state of the United States or any territory or possession of the United States and the District of Columbia acting under Article 1, section 10, clause 3, of the Constitution of the United States in entering this compact with an American or a foreign jurisdiction, or (2) a state of the community of nations and any component governmental unit of such a state which under the laws thereof may validly become party to this compact. (b) A person shall include any entity capable of suing or being sued in the state in which the interpleader is pending. (c) Interpleader shall mean a judicial procedure by which two or more persons who have adverse claims against a third person may be required to litigate these claims in one proceeding. Article 3. Service of process.--(a) Service of process sufficient to acquire personal jurisdiction may be made within a state party to this compact, by a person who institutes an interpleader proceeding or interpleader part of a proceeding in another state, party to this compact, provided that such service shall fulfill the requirements for service of process of the state in which the service is made and provided further that such service shall meet the minimum standards for service of the jurisdiction where the proceeding is pending. (b) No such service of process shall be valid unless either: (1) The subject matter of the proceeding is specific real property or tangible personal property situated within the state in which the proceeding is pending; or (2) One or more of the claimants shall be either a permanent resident or domiciliary of the state in which the proceeding is pending; or (3) A significant portion of the transaction out of which the proceeding shall have arisen shall have taken place in the state in which the proceeding is pending; or (4) One of the claimants shall have initiated the action. Article 4. Scope of interpleader unaffected.--Nothing in this compact shall be construed to change any requirement or limitation on the scope of interpleader of the state in which the interpleader proceeding is pending except in relation to acquisition of personal jurisdiction. Article 5. Finality of judgment.--No judgment obtained against any person in any proceeding to which he had become a party by reason of service of process effected pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be subject to attack on the ground that the adjudicating court did not have personal jurisdiction over such person. Article 6. Enactment.--(a) This compact shall enter into force and effect as to a state one year from the date it has taken whatever action may be necessary pursuant to its required processes to make this compact part of the laws of such state and the appropriate authority of such state shall have deposited a duly authenticated copy of its statute, proclamation, order, or similar official pronouncement having the force of law and embodying this compact as law with the appropriate officer or agency of each of the states party thereto. In the statute, proclamation, order, or similar act by which a state adopts this compact, it shall specify the officer or agency with whom the documents referred to in this article shall be deposited. (b) Unless the statute, proclamation, order, or similar act by which a state adopts this compact shall specify otherwise, and name the states with which the state intends to compact, such adoption shall apply to all other states then party to or who may subsequently become party to this compact. In the event that a state shall enter this compact with some states but not with others, the deposit of documents required by paragraph (a) of this article shall be effected only with those states to which the adopting state specifies an intention to be bound. Article 7. Withdrawal.--(a) This compact shall continue in force and remain binding on a party state until such state shall withdraw therefrom. To be valid and effective, any withdrawal must be preceded by a formal notice in writing of one year from the appropriate authority of that state. Such notice shall be communicated to the same officer or agency in each party state with which the notice of adoption was deposited pursuant to Article 6 of this compact. In the event that a state wishes to withdraw with respect to one or more states, but wishes to remain a party to this compact with other states party thereto, its notice of withdrawal shall be communicated only to those states with respect to which withdrawal is contemplated. (b) Withdrawal shall not be effective as to service of process accomplished pursuant to this compact prior to the actual date of withdrawal. (c) Any state receiving a notice of adoption from another state may by action of its executive head within a year from the receipt of such notice in the manner provided for withdrawal in paragraph (a) of this article specify its intention not to be bound to the state depositing such notice and such adoption thereupon shall not be binding upon the state so acting. Article 8. Severability and construction.--The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, or in the case of a component governmental unit, to the constitution of the state of which it is a part, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby; provided that if this compact shall be held invalid or contrary to the constitution of any government participating therein the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining governments and in full force and effect as to the government affected as to all severable matters.

(a) General rule.-- No bonds or notes shall be issued with a stated maturity date exceeding the sooner to occur of: (1) Forty years from the date of the series of any bonds or notes issued to evidence debt for the purpose of financing the cost of actually constructing, acquiring or improving a project or a separately financed portion of a project or funding an unfunded actuarial accrued liability. (2) (i) The useful life of the project being financed as stated in the ordinance of the local government unit enacted in connection with the series of bonds or notes to be issued for the project, which statement in the ordinance shall be conclusive for all purposes. If projects have been combined for financing pursuant to section 8101 (relating to combining projects for financing or series of bonds or notes for sale) and the projects have different useful lives, it is sufficient for this section if an aggregate principal amount of bonds or notes equal to the separate cost of each project having a shorter useful life have been stated to mature prior to the end of the useful life, and the balance prior to the end of the longest useful life. For the purpose of this paragraph, the inclusion of furnishings, machinery, apparatus or equipment for a construction or acquisition project shall not be deemed to be the combining of projects, but the useful life of the project shall be that of the building, structure or improvement constructed or acquired. (ii) Where capital budgeting is practiced and bonds are issued to fund the current portion of a capital budget involving projects of varying useful lives, a uniform term of 30 years may be used. (iii) Where the project being financed is a countywide revision of assessment of real property, the useful life shall be a term of no more than ten years. (iv) Where a project consists of the funding of all or a portion of a reserve, or a contribution toward a combined reserve, pool or other arrangement, relating to self-insurance, the useful life shall be the term specified in the ordinance of the local government unit, not to exceed 20 years, or, if none is specified, then the useful life shall be deemed to be 20 years. (b) Mandatory redemption and stated maturities or installments.-- Bonds or notes may be serial bonds or notes or term bonds or notes or any combination thereof that may be selected by the governing body of the issuing local government unit. Except for bonds or notes issued to fund an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, if term bonds or notes are issued, the bonds or notes shall be subject to mandatory redemption, and, if serial or installment bonds or notes, the amounts of the stated maturities or installments shall be fixed: (1) so as to amortize the issue on at least an approximately level annual debt service plan during the period specified for the payment of principal in subsection (c); or (2) so that the debt service on outstanding debt of the same classification, and for this purpose lease rental debt shall be considered as the same classification as general obligation debt, will be brought more nearly into an overall level annual debt service plan. (c) Deferral of stated installments or maturities or mandatory redemption.-- Except as provided by subsection (e), stated installments or maturities of principal of any series of bonds or notes or the mandatory redemption of the principal may not be deferred beyond the later of two years from date of issue or one year after estimated completion of construction. In the case of revenue or guaranteed revenue bonds, this provision will be satisfied by a covenant for the mandatory application to term bonds of such revenues as may remain after payment of interest and operating expenses up to a fixed amount conforming to subsection (b) as shall be specified in the ordinance pursuant to which the bonds or notes are issued. (d) Fixing earlier maturity dates.-- This section does not prevent the fixing of the amount of stated maturity dates so that a greater percentage of a series will mature on earlier dates than those allowable by this subpart. (e) Maturity dates for different series.-- This section does not prevent the authorization of bonds or notes of an issue for sale in one or more series, in which case the first stated maturity of a later series may be later than, but not more than 15 months later than, the last stated maturity of the next preceding series.",

When a local agency is liable for damages under this paragraph by reason of its power and authority to require installation and repair of sidewalks under the care, custody and control of other persons, the local agency shall be secondarily liable only and such other persons shall be primarily liable. (8) Care, custody or control of animals.-- The care, custody or control of animals in the possession or control of a local agency, including but not limited to police dogs and horses. Damages shall not be recoverable under this paragraph on account of any injury caused by wild animals, including but not limited to bears and deer, except as otherwise provided by statute. (9) Sexual abuse.-- Conduct which constitutes an offense enumerated under section 5551(7) (relating to no limitation applicable) if the injuries to the plaintiff were caused by actions or omissions of the local agency which constitute negligence. (c) Limited definition.-- As used in this section the amount of time reasonably required to take protective measures, including inspections required by law, shall be determined with reference to the actual equipment, personnel and facilities available to the local agency and the competing demands therefor. (d) Evidence.-- Whenever any plaintiff claims liability under subsection (b)(1), evidence is admissible to demonstrate that the plaintiff, at any time during the course of the alleged negligence, was engaged or participating in willful misconduct, including, but not limited to, the illegal possession of controlled substances, firearms or ammunition.

      "text": "§ 8703. Adoption of referendum. (a) General rule.-- (1) In order to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter, a governing body shall use the procedures set forth in subsection (b). (2) Any governing body after making an election to levy an earned income and net profits tax under this chapter may, after a period of at least three full fiscal years, elect under the provisions of subsection (c) to levy, assess and collect the taxes prohibited by section 8701(b) (relating to general tax authorization) to the extent otherwise provided by law. If the electorate approves such referendum, the governing body shall lose the authority to continue to levy an earned income and net profits tax authorized under this chapter. (b) Public referendum requirements.-- Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements of section 8716 (relating to procedure and administration), a governing body may levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter only by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at only the municipal election preceding the fiscal year when the earned income and net profits tax will be initially imposed. The referendum question must state the initial rate of the proposed earned income and net profits tax, the reason for the tax and the amount of proposed budgeted revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum, expressed as a percent increase over the prior year's budgeted revenue. Any increase in budgeted revenue between the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum and the prior year's budgeted revenue shall not exceed the annual percent change in the Statewide average weekly wage. The question shall be in clear language that is readily understandable by a layperson. For the purpose of illustration, a referendum question may be framed as follows: Do you favor the imposition of an earned income and net profits tax of X% to be used to replace (names of local taxes to be repealed), reduce real property taxes by X% by means of a homestead exclusion and provide for a one-time revenue increase of X% over the preceding fiscal year? A nonlegal interpretative statement must accompany the question in accordance with section 201.1 of the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code, that includes the following: the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax and the maximum allowable rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the estimated revenues to be derived from the initial rate of the earned income and net profits tax imposed under this chapter; the amount of proposed revenue growth, if any, in the first fiscal year following adoption of the referendum; the estimated reduction in real property taxes and the elimination of certain existing taxes under this chapter; the identification of the existing taxes to be eliminated under this chapter; the method to be used to reduce real property taxes; the class or classes of real property for which real property taxes would be reduced; and the estimated amount of real property tax reduction by class, expressed as an average percent reduction by class. Any governing body which uses the procedures under this section shall not be subject to the provisions of section 8704 (relating to public referendum requirements for increasing property taxes previously reduced) for any future increases in the earned income and net profits tax rates authorized under this chapter. Any future real property tax rate increases are subject to the provisions of section 8704. If the ballot question fails to receive a majority vote pursuant to this section, approval of the electorate under section 8704 shall not be required to increase the rate of any tax which the governing body of the affected school district is authorized to levy and increase pursuant to any other act. (c) Public referendum requirements to end participation under this chapter.-- Subject to the notice and public hearing requirements in section 4 of the Local Tax Enabling Act, a governing body may elect to end participation under this chapter in accordance with subsection (a)(2) by obtaining the approval of the electorate of the affected school district in a public referendum at a municipal election. (d) Public requirements to initiate referendum.-- (1) If the governing body of a school district fails to place a referendum question on the ballot within two years after the effective date of this chapter, the electors of the school district may: (i) Circulate a petition which, if signed by electors comprising 2% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with the election officials and submitted to the governing body thereof, shall require the governing body to establish a local tax study commission. The provisions under paragraph (2)(v), (vi), (vii), (viii) (ix) and (x) shall not apply to this subparagraph. (ii) If the local tax study commission makes a recommendation to levy the earned income and net profits tax under this chapter and the governing body fails to place the recommendation or other alternative of the governing body authorized under this chapter on the ballot in accordance with this chapter at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the submission of the recommendation to the governing body, a petition under this paragraph may be circulated. If the petition is signed by the electors comprising 5% of the number of electors voting for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election in the school district and filed with election officials at least 90 days prior to the next municipal election, the petition shall compel the election officials to place the recommendation upon the ballot at the next municipal election occurring at least 90 days after the filing of the petition. (2) The following requirements shall apply to the process under paragraph (1): (i) The name and street address of each elector signing the petition and of the person filing the petition shall be clearly stated on the petition. The petition shall include an affidavit of the circulator that he or she is a qualified elector of the school district referred to in the petition; that the signers signed with full knowledge of the contents of the petition; that the signers' residences are correctly stated; and that, to the best of the circulator's knowledge and belief, the signers are qualified electors. (ii) The election officials shall, within ten days after filing, review the petition as to the number and qualifications of signers. If the petition appears to be defective, the election officials shall immediately notify the person filing the petition of the defect and may reject the petition if warranted. (iii) The petition as submitted to the election officials, along with the list of signatories, shall be open to public inspection in the office of the election officials. (iv) If the election officials find that the petition as submitted is in proper order, they shall send copies of the petition without signatures thereon to the governing body involved. (v) The procedure for the referendum shall be governed by the act of June 3, 1937 (P.L.1333, No.320), known as the Pennsylvania Election Code.

The Administrative Office shall cause all orders of the Supreme Court entered under this subsection to be codified in the Pennsylvania Code.

(2) Where the officer is in hot pursuit of any person for any offense which was committed, or which he has probable cause to believe was committed, within his primary jurisdiction and for which offense the officer continues in fresh pursuit of the person after the commission of the offense.

(2) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are less than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, each maintenance district's share shall be reduced, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocation within the funding limits, in the same proportion that each county's base allocations bears to the combined total of all counties' base allocations. (3) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are greater than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, the funds shall be distributed based upon the formula in subsection (b), but notwithstanding the formula calculation for any particular county, no county shall receive less than its base allocation in any year. (b) Formula for distribution.-- The department shall distribute to each county maintenance district: (1) an amount equal to the county's base allocation; plus (2) an amount based on the following incremental formula in which each county shall receive a portion of State highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations in excess of the total of all counties' base allocations, expressed in the following manner: ASHMA (40% RPQc + 15% BMDc + 30% LMc + 15% VMc). (c) Establishment of applicable data.-- The applicable data for all counties corresponding to each individual factor in the incremental formula in subsection (b) shall be established and certified by the Governor by May 1 of each year based on the best information available at that time for the immediately preceding five-year period with the exception of BMD. The submission of data relative to BMD shall only include the immediately preceding 12-month period beginning with fiscal year 1997-1998. In each subsequent fiscal year, an additional year of data relative to BMD shall be added until such time as data from a five-year period has been accumulated. (d) Effect of insufficient funds.-- In the event sufficient funds are not available to fully fund all county maintenance districts under the formula in subsection (b) due to the hold harmless provision in subsection (a), each county maintenance district receiving an increase above its base allocation shall have its share reduced in the proportion that the increase over its base allocation bears to the total increases over the base allocation of all counties entitled to an increase, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocations within the funding limit.

(a) General rule.-- To be eligible for relief under this subchapter, the petitioner must plead and prove by a preponderance of the evidence all of the following: (1) That the petitioner has been convicted of a crime under the laws of this Commonwealth and is at the time relief is granted: (i) currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation or parole for the crime; (ii) awaiting execution of a sentence of death for the crime; (iii) serving a sentence which must expire before the person may commence serving the disputed sentence; or (iv) has completed a sentence of imprisonment, probation or parole for the crime and is seeking relief based upon DNA evidence obtained under section 9543.1(d) (relating to postconviction DNA testing). (2) That the conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the following: (i) A violation of the Constitution of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place. (ii) Ineffective assistance of counsel which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place. (iii) A plea of guilty unlawfully induced where the circumstances make it likely that the inducement caused the petitioner to plead guilty and the petitioner is innocent. (iv) The improper obstruction by government officials of the petitioner's right of appeal where a meritorious appealable issue existed and was properly preserved in the trial court. (v) (Deleted by amendment). (vi) The unavailability at the time of trial of exculpatory evidence that has subsequently become available and would have changed the outcome of the trial if it had been introduced. (vii) The imposition of a sentence greater than the lawful maximum. (viii) A proceeding in a tribunal without jurisdiction. (3) That the allegation of error has not been previously litigated or waived. (4) That the failure to litigate the issue prior to or during trial, during unitary review or on direct appeal could not have been the result of any rational, strategic or tactical decision by counsel. (b) Exception.-- Even if the petitioner has met the requirements of subsection (a), the petition shall be dismissed if it appears at any time that, because of delay in filing the petition, the Commonwealth has been prejudiced either in its ability to respond to the petition or in its ability to re-try the petitioner. A petition may be dismissed due to delay in the filing by the petitioner only after a hearing upon a motion to dismiss. This subsection does not apply if the petitioner shows that the petition is based on grounds of which the petitioner could not have discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the delay became prejudicial to the Commonwealth. (c) Extradition.-- If the petitioner's conviction and sentence resulted from a trial conducted in his absence and if the petitioner has fled to a foreign country that refuses to extradite him because a trial in absentia was employed, the petitioner shall be entitled to the grant of a new trial if the refusing country agrees by virtue of this provision to return him and if the petitioner upon such return to this jurisdiction so requests.

      "text": "§ 9543.1. Postconviction DNA testing. (a) Motion.-- (1) An individual convicted of a criminal offense in a court of this Commonwealth may apply by making a written motion to the sentencing court at any time for the performance of forensic DNA testing on specific evidence that is related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment of conviction. (2) The evidence may have been discovered either prior to or after the applicant's conviction. The evidence shall be available for testing as of the date of the motion. If the evidence was discovered prior to the applicant's conviction, the evidence shall not have been subject to the DNA testing requested because the technology for testing was not in existence at the time of the trial or the applicant's counsel did not seek testing at the time of the trial in a case where a verdict was rendered on or before January 1, 1995, or the evidence was subject to the testing, but newer technology could provide substantially more accurate and substantially probative results, or the applicant's counsel sought funds from the court to pay for the testing because his client was indigent and the court refused the request despite the client's indigency. (3) A request for DNA testing under this section shall be by written petition and shall be filed with the clerk of courts of the judicial district where the sentence is imposed. (4) DNA testing may be sought at any time if the motion is made in a timely manner and for the purpose of demonstrating the applicant's actual innocence and not to delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a plea of guilty to a crime of violence, as defined in section 9714(g) (relating to sentences for second and subsequent offenses), or a confession given by an applicant concerning the offense for which the applicant was convicted, shall not prohibit the applicant from asserting actual innocence under subsection (c)(2) or the court from making a determination and ordering DNA testing under subsection (d)(2). (6) The motion shall explain how, after review of the record of the applicant's trial, there is a reasonable possibility if the applicant is under State supervision, or there is a reasonable probability if the applicant is not under State supervision, or after review of the record of the applicant's guilty plea there is a reasonable probability, that the testing would produce exculpatory evidence that would establish: (i) the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted; (ii) in a capital case, the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) (relating to sentencing procedure for murder of the first degree) if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence of death; or (iii) in a capital case, a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) under the circumstances set forth in section 9711(c)(1)(iv). (b) Notice to the Commonwealth.-- (1) Upon receipt of a motion under subsection (a), the court shall notify the Commonwealth and shall afford the Commonwealth an opportunity to respond to the motion. (2) Upon receipt of a motion under subsection (a) or notice of the motion, as applicable, the Commonwealth and the court shall take the steps reasonably necessary to ensure that any remaining biological material in the possession of the Commonwealth or the court is preserved pending the completion of the proceedings under this section. (c) Requirements.-- In any motion under subsection (a), under penalty of perjury, the applicant shall: (1) (i) specify the evidence to be tested; (ii) state that the applicant consents to provide samples of bodily fluid for use in the DNA testing; and (iii) acknowledge that the applicant understands that, if the motion is granted, any data obtained from any DNA samples or test results may be entered into law enforcement databases, may be used in the investigation of other crimes and may be used as evidence against the applicant in other cases. (2) (i) in a sworn statement subject to the penalties under 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 4902 (relating to perjury) and 4903 (relating to false swearing), assert the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted and that the applicant seeks DNA testing for the purpose of demonstrating the applicant's actual innocence; and (ii) in a capital case: (A) assert the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence of death; or (B) assert that the outcome of the DNA testing would establish a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) if that mitigating circumstance was presented to the sentencing judge or jury and facts as to that issue were in dispute at the sentencing hearing. (3) present a prima facie case demonstrating that the: (i) identity of or the participation in the crime by the perpetrator was at issue in the proceedings that resulted in the applicant's conviction and sentencing; and (ii) DNA testing of the specific evidence, assuming exculpatory results, would establish: (A) the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted; (B) in a capital case, the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence of death; or (C) in a capital case, a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) under the circumstances set forth in section 9711(c)(1)(iv). (d) Order.-- (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the court shall order the testing requested in a motion under subsection (a) under reasonable conditions designed to preserve the integrity of the evidence and the testing process upon a determination, after review of the record of the applicant's trial, that the: (i) requirements of subsection (c) have been met; (ii) evidence to be tested has been subject to a chain of custody sufficient to establish that it has not been altered in any material respect; and (iii) motion is made in a timely manner and for the purpose of demonstrating the applicant's actual innocence and not to delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice. (2) The court shall not order the testing requested in a motion under subsection (a) if, after review of the record of the applicant's trial, the court determines that there is no reasonable possibility for an applicant under State supervision, or there is no reasonable probability for an applicant not under State supervision, or after review of the record of the applicant's guilty plea, the court determines that there is no reasonable probability, that the testing would produce exculpatory evidence that: (i) would establish the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted; (ii) in a capital case, would establish the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence of death; or (iii) in a capital case, would establish a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) under the circumstances set forth in section 9711(c)(1)(iv). (3) Any DNA testing order under this section shall constitute a final order. An applicant or the Commonwealth may appeal a decision denying or granting a DNA testing order in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure. (4) Any decision granting or denying a DNA testing order shall include an explanation by the court of how the testing requested in a motion under subsection (a) has met or fails to have met the requirements under paragraphs (1), (2) and (3). (5) Upon determining the petitioner has met the applicable burden established in paragraph (1) or (2), the court may require the Commonwealth to prepare an inventory of evidence related to the case and serve a copy of the inventory to the prosecution, the applicant, the applicant's attorney, if applicable, and the court. The inventory may include, but not be limited to, a list of evidence collected and forensic testing previously done relating to the evidence and the names of agencies that conducted the forensic testing. (e) Testing procedures.-- (1) Any DNA testing ordered under this section shall be conducted by: (i) a laboratory mutually selected by the Commonwealth and the applicant; (ii) a laboratory selected by the court that ordered the testing if the Commonwealth and the applicant are unable to agree on a laboratory; or (iii) if the applicant is indigent, the testing shall be conducted by the Pennsylvania State Police or, at the Pennsylvania State Police's sole discretion, by a laboratory designated by the Pennsylvania State Police. (2) The costs of any testing ordered under this section shall be paid: (i) by the applicant; or (ii) in the case of an applicant who is indigent, by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (3) To the extent possible and not inconsistent with best laboratory practices, the testing shall be conducted in a manner that ensures that some portion of the sample is preserved for replication of testing. If the laboratory determines it may be necessary to consume the entirety of any sample during testing, the laboratory shall inform the prosecution, the applicant and the applicant's attorney, if applicable, of its recommendation and obtain the prosecution and the applicant's consent before proceeding. If the prosecution and the applicant do not consent, the court may issue any appropriate order before testing proceeds. (4) If testing is performed by a private laboratory and a DNA database search is anticipated, the applicant shall ensure that the chosen laboratory is accredited by an accreditation body that is a signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation Mutual Recognition Agreement that is designated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with 34 U.S.C. § 12591 (relating to quality assurance and proficiency testing standards), that requires conformance to forensic science requirements and that the accreditation include DNA testing, and is compliant with Federal Bureau of Investigation quality assurance standards. (5) When testing is performed by a private laboratory, the public laboratory shall take all reasonable measures before the testing is conducted to ensure that the results of the testing may be entered into CODIS so that a comparison to known offender or crime scene profiles may be made if the laboratory and test results otherwise satisfy the criteria for database entry. (6) Testing conducted by the Pennsylvania State Police shall be carried out in accordance with the protocols and procedures established by the Pennsylvania State Police. (7) To the extent possible, if communication with the parties regarding the testing process and test results is necessary, the testing laboratory shall communicate with counsel for petitioner and the Commonwealth simultaneously. (8) No direct communication involving the testing laboratory without the inclusion of a representative of each party shall occur. (f) Posttesting procedures.-- (1) After the DNA testing conducted under this section has been completed, the applicant may, pursuant to section 9545(b)(2) (relating to jurisdiction and proceedings), during the one-year period beginning on the date on which the applicant is notified of the test results, petition to the court for postconviction relief pursuant to section 9543(a)(2)(vi) (relating to eligibility for relief). (2) Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the court shall consider the petition along with any answer filed by the Commonwealth and shall conduct a hearing thereon. (3) In any hearing on a petition for postconviction relief filed under paragraph (1), the court shall determine whether the exculpatory evidence resulting from the DNA testing conducted under this section would have changed the outcome of the trial as required by section 9543(a)(2)(vi). (4) If testing complies with Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements and the data meets NDIS criteria, profiles obtained from the testing shall be searched or uploaded to CODIS. (5) When testing is conducted by a private laboratory, a court may order a public laboratory with access to CODIS to take the necessary measures to ensure the DNA profile obtained from probative biological material from crime scene evidence can be uploaded to CODIS by the public laboratory. Necessary measures may include requiring the public laboratory to conduct a review of the private laboratory's facilities or records to ensure that the private laboratory complies with Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements regarding CODIS. If the private laboratory meets Federal Bureau of Investigation and CODIS requirements, the court may order the public laboratory to upload the DNA profile to determine whether the profile matches a profile of a known individual or a profile from an unsolved crime. The DNA profile submitted to the databases must comply with the Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements for the uploading of DNA profiles to CODIS, and the Commonwealth shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that the testing complies with the requirements. (6) If DNA testing conclusively identifies the DNA profile of the applicant on probative and inculpatory evidence, the court shall dismiss the petition and may make any further orders that are appropriate. An order under this paragraph may: (i) direct that the Pennsylvania Parole Board be notified of the test results; or (ii) mandate that the applicant's DNA profile be added to the Commonwealth's convicted offender database. (g) Effect of motion.-- The filing of a motion for forensic DNA testing pursuant to subsection (a) shall have the following effect: (1) The filing of the motion shall constitute the applicant's consent to provide samples of bodily fluid for use in the DNA testing. (2) The data from any DNA samples or test results obtained as a result of the motion may be entered into law enforcement databases, may be used in the investigation of other crimes and may be used as evidence against the applicant in other cases. (h) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Applicant.\" The individual who files a motion under subsection (a). \"CODIS.\" The Combined DNA Index System administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that allows for the storage and exchange of DNA records submitted by Federal, State and local forensic DNA laboratories. \"DNA.\" Deoxyribonucleic acid. \"NDIS.\" The National DNA Index System which is the national DNA database system of DNA records and meets Federal quality assurance and privacy standards. \"Public laboratory.\" The Pennsylvania State Police Forensic DNA Division, the Philadelphia Police Department Forensic Science Bureau, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office or any other laboratory maintained by the Commonwealth with access to CODIS.

(b) Time for filing petition.-- (1) Any petition under this subchapter, including a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final, unless the petition alleges and the petitioner proves that: (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States; (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively.

(a) Findings.-- The General Assembly hereby finds that imposition of a tax on oil company revenues should provide the Department of Transportation with an annual growth in revenues which offsets the growth in highway maintenance and construction costs more effectively than the annual changes in revenues produced by the flat-rate tax on the retail price of gasoline and by the various other taxes and fees levied on behalf of the department. As a result of such a tax on oil company revenues, the Department of Transportation should have sufficient revenues to carry out necessary maintenance and construction activities with less frequent increases in highway taxes and fees than the General Assembly has enacted in recent years. One effect of less frequent requests for highway tax and fee increases could be a significant decrease in the ability of the General Assembly to oversee the activities of the Department of Transportation. Accordingly, the General Assembly finds that responsible legislative oversight requires ongoing monitoring of the department's activities and periodic indepth evaluations of its performance. (b) Annual reports.-- No later than 30 days after the effective date of this section, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the 1981-1982 fiscal year. No later than 30 days before the beginning of the 1982-1983 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the upcoming fiscal year. No later than 30 days after the end of the 1981-1982 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the reasons for any major deviations from the maintenance and construction program which had been planned for that member's district during that fiscal year. (c) Performance audits.-- During the 1983-1984 fiscal year, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, a performance audit of the department carried out in accordance with the standards for performance and financial compliance auditing developed by the United States General Accounting Office. The performance audit shall determine whether the department is conducting authorized activities or programs in a manner consistent with accomplishing the objectives intended by the General Assembly and is conducting programs or activities and expending available funds in a faithful, efficient, economical and effective manner. The Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall make a written report of the findings of the performance audit and shall submit a copy of that report to each member of the House of Representatives and each member of the Senate prior to enactment of a maintenance and construction budget for the department for the 1984-1985 fiscal year.

(a) Procedure in jury trials.-- (1) After a verdict of murder of the first degree is recorded and before the jury is discharged, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing in which the jury shall determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. (2) In the sentencing hearing, evidence concerning the victim and the impact that the death of the victim has had on the family of the victim is admissible. Additionally, evidence may be presented as to any other matter that the court deems relevant and admissible on the question of the sentence to be imposed. Evidence shall include matters relating to any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances specified in subsections (d) and (e), and information concerning the victim and the impact that the death of the victim has had on the family of the victim. Evidence of aggravating circumstances shall be limited to those circumstances specified in subsection (d). (3) After the presentation of evidence, the court shall permit counsel to present argument for or against the sentence of death. The court shall then instruct the jury in accordance with subsection (c). (4) Failure of the jury to unanimously agree upon a sentence shall not impeach or in any way affect the guilty verdict previously recorded. (b) Procedure in nonjury trials and guilty pleas.-- If the defendant has waived a jury trial or pleaded guilty, the sentencing proceeding shall be conducted before a jury impaneled for that purpose unless waived by the defendant with the consent of the Commonwealth, in which case the trial judge shall hear the evidence and determine the penalty in the same manner as would a jury as provided in subsection (a). (c) Instructions to jury.-- (1) Before the jury retires to consider the sentencing verdict, the court shall instruct the jury on the following matters: (i) The aggravating circumstances specified in subsection (d) as to which there is some evidence. (ii) The mitigating circumstances specified in subsection (e) as to which there is some evidence. (iii) Aggravating circumstances must be proved by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt; mitigating circumstances must be proved by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. (iv) The verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d) and no mitigating circumstance or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances. The verdict must be a sentence of life imprisonment in all other cases. (v) The court may, in its discretion, discharge the jury if it is of the opinion that further deliberation will not result in a unanimous agreement as to the sentence, in which case the court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment. (2) The court shall instruct the jury that if it finds at least one aggravating circumstance and at least one mitigating circumstance, it shall consider, in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, any evidence presented about the victim and about the impact of the murder on the victim's family. The court shall also instruct the jury on any other matter that may be just and proper under the circumstances. (d) Aggravating circumstances.-- Aggravating circumstances shall be limited to the following: (1) The victim was a firefighter, peace officer, public servant concerned in official detention, as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 5121 (relating to escape), judge of any court in the unified judicial system, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, a deputy attorney general, district attorney, assistant district attorney, member of the General Assembly, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Auditor General, State Treasurer, State law enforcement official, local law enforcement official, Federal law enforcement official or person employed to assist or assisting any law enforcement official in the performance of his duties, who was killed in the performance of his duties or as a result of his official position.

(10) The defendant has been convicted of another Federal or State offense, committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable or the defendant was undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment for any reason at the time of the commission of the offense. (11) The defendant has been convicted of another murder committed in any jurisdiction and committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue. (12) The defendant has been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2503 (relating to voluntary manslaughter), or a substantially equivalent crime in any other jurisdiction, committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue.

In every case in which the court imposes a sentence for a felony or misdemeanor, modifies a sentence, resentences a person following revocation of probation or resentences following remand, the court shall make as a part of the record, and disclose in open court at the time of sentencing, a statement of the reason or reasons for the sentence imposed. In every case where the court imposes a sentence or resentence outside the guidelines adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing under sections 2154 (relating to adoption of guidelines for sentencing), 2154.1 (relating to adoption of guidelines for restrictive conditions), 2154.3 (relating to adoption of guidelines for fines), 2154.4 (relating to adoption of guidelines for resentencing) and 2154.5 (relating to adoption of guidelines for parole) and made effective under section 2155, the court shall provide a contemporaneous written statement of the reason or reasons for the deviation from the guidelines to the commission, as established under section 2153(a)(14) (relating to powers and duties). Failure to comply shall be grounds for vacating the sentence or resentence and resentencing the defendant. (c) Mandatory restitution.-- In addition to the alternatives set forth in subsection (a) of this section the court shall order the defendant to compensate the victim of his criminal conduct for the damage or injury that he sustained. For purposes of this subsection, the term \"victim\" shall be as defined in section 479.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929. (c.1) Mandatory payment of costs.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9728 (relating to collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties) or any provision of law to the contrary, in addition to the alternatives set forth in subsection (a), the court shall order the defendant to pay costs. In the event the court fails to issue an order for costs pursuant to section 9728, costs shall be imposed upon the defendant under this section. No court order shall be necessary for the defendant to incur liability for costs under this section. The provisions of this subsection do not alter the court's discretion under Pa.R.Crim.P. No. 706(C) (relating to fines or costs). (d) Detailed criteria.-- With respect to each alternative the criteria to be considered by the court are set forth in this subchapter. (e) Term of imprisonment.-- All sentences of imprisonment imposed under this chapter shall be for a definite term. (Nov. 26, 1978, P.L.1316, No.319, eff.

(a) Imposition of sentence.-- A defendant found guilty but mentally ill or whose plea of guilty but mentally ill is accepted under the provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. § 314 (relating to guilty but mentally ill) may have any sentence imposed on him which may lawfully be imposed on any defendant convicted of the same offense. Before imposing sentence, the court shall hear testimony and make a finding on the issue of whether the defendant at the time of sentencing is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment pursuant to the provisions of the act of July 9, 1976 (P.L.817, No.143), known as the Mental Health Procedures Act. (b) Treatment.-- (1) An offender who is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment at the time of sentencing shall, consistent with available resources, be provided such treatment as is psychiatrically or psychologically indicated for his mental illness. Treatment may be provided by the Department of Corrections, by the county or by the Department of Human Services in accordance with the Mental Health Procedures Act. (2) The cost for treatment of offenders found guilty but mentally ill, committed to the custody of the Bureau of Correction and transferred to a mental health facility, shall be borne by the Commonwealth. (c) Discharge report.-- When a treating facility designated by either the Department of Corrections or the Department of Human Services discharges such a defendant from treatment prior to the expiration of his maximum sentence, that treating facility shall transmit to the Pennsylvania Parole Board, the correctional facility or county jail to which the offender is being returned and the sentencing judge a report on the condition of the offender together with the reasons for its judgments, which describes: (1) The defendant's behavior. (2) The course of treatment. (3) The potential for recurrence of the behavior. (4) The potential for danger to himself or the public. (5) Recommendations for future treatment. (d) Parole conditions.-- An offender who is discharged from treatment may be placed on parole status under the same terms and laws applicable to any other offender. Psychological and psychiatric counseling and treatment may be required as a condition of such status. Failure to continue treatment, except by agreement of the supervising authority, shall be a basis for instituting parole violation hearings. (e) Parole procedure.-- The paroling authority may consider the offender for parole pursuant to other law or administrative rules. When the paroling authority considers the offender for parole, it shall consult with the treating facility at which the offender is being treated or from which he was discharged. (f) Probation.-- (1) If an offender who is found guilty but mentally ill is placed on probation, the court may, upon recommendation of the district attorney or upon its own initiative, make treatment a condition of probation. (2) Reports as specified by the trial judge shall be filed with the probation officer and the sentencing court. Failure to continue treatment, including the refusal to take such drugs as may be prescribed, except by agreement of the sentencing court, shall be a basis for the institution of probation violation hearings. The period of probation shall be the maximum permitted by law and shall not be reduced without receipt and consideration by the court of a mental health status report like that required in subsection (c). (3) Treatment shall be provided by an agency approved by the Department of Human Services or, with the approval of the sentencing court and at individual expense, by private agencies, private physicians or other mental health personnel. A mental health status report, containing the information set forth in subsection (c), shall be filed with the probation officer and the sentencing court every three months during the period of probation.

(a) Method of payment.-- The treasurer of each county shall allow the use of credit cards, debit cards and bank cards in the payment of court costs, restitution and fines and may provide for automatic periodic deductions from a bank account, subject to the agreement of the owner of the account. (a.1) Wage attachment.-- A court may, at sentencing, assign an amount not greater than 25% of the defendant's gross salary, wages or other earnings to be used for the payment of court costs, restitution or fines. (b) Procedures regarding default.-- (1) If a defendant defaults in the payment of court costs, restitution or fines after imposition of sentence, the issuing authority or a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge appointed by the president judge for the purposes of this section may conduct a hearing to determine whether the defendant is financially able to pay. (2) If the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge determines that the defendant is financially able to pay the costs, restitution or fine, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may enter an order for wage attachment, turn the delinquent account over to a private collection agency or impose imprisonment for nonpayment, as provided by law. (2.1) (i) If the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge schedules a financial determination hearing for the defendant and provides notice to the defendant of the hearing, but the defendant fails to appear at the financial determination hearing, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may turn the delinquent account over to a private collection agency or the county's collection enforcement unit as set forth under section 9728 (relating to collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties), as provided by law. (ii) In each communication with the defendant, the private collection agency or the county's collection enforcement unit shall notify the defendant of the defendant's right to request a new financial determination hearing under paragraph (2.2). (2.2) (i) If the defendant has a delinquent account turned over to a private collection agency or the county's collection enforcement unit under paragraph (2.1), the defendant may request a new financial determination hearing on the defendant's financial ability to pay the court costs, restitution or fines. (ii) Upon receipt of the request for a new financial determination hearing under this paragraph, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge shall schedule and conduct the hearing in accordance with this subsection. (iii) Upon notice that the defendant has requested a new financial determination hearing under this paragraph, the private collection agency or the county's collection enforcement unit shall cease all collections activities pending the conclusion of the financial determination hearing.

(v) If the defendant requests a new financial determination hearing after failing to appear at a hearing previously requested under this paragraph, the private collection agency or county collection enforcement unit's collection activities may continue unless stayed by court order. (3) (i) If the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge determines that the defendant is without the financial means to pay the costs, restitution or fines immediately or in a single remittance, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may provide for payment in installments or, in the case of costs or fines, reduce or waive the costs or fines, except costs imposed under section 1101 of the act of November 24, 1998 (P.L.882, No.111), known as the Crime Victims Act. In determining the appropriate installments, reduction or waiver, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge shall consider the defendant's financial resources, the defendant's ability to make restitution and reparations and the nature of the burden the payment will impose on the defendant. (ii) If the defendant is in default of a payment or advises the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge that default is imminent, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may schedule a rehearing on the payment schedule. At the rehearing the defendant has the burden of proving changes of financial condition such that the defendant is without the means to meet the payment schedule. The issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may extend or accelerate the schedule, leave it unaltered, reduce or waive the costs or fines, except costs imposed under section 1101 of the Crime Victims Act, or sentence the defendant to a period of community service as the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge finds to be just and practicable under the circumstances. (iii) If the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge determines that the defendant is without the financial means to pay the costs, restitution or fines under this paragraph, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge shall waive an existing collection fee under section 9730.1(b) (relating to collection of court costs, restitution and fines by private collection agency) that was not previously collected from the defendant who is determined to be without the financial means to pay the costs, restitution or fines under this paragraph.

(a) General rule.-- The court has inherent power to at any time terminate continued supervision, lessen the conditions upon which an order of probation has been imposed or increase the conditions under which an order of probation has been imposed upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that a person presents an identifiable threat to public safety. (b) Revocation.-- The court may increase the conditions, impose a brief sanction under section 9771.1 (relating to court-imposed sanctions for violating probation) or revoke an order of probation upon proof of the violation of specified conditions of the probation. Subject to the limitations of subsections (b.1) and (c), upon revocation the sentencing alternatives available to the court shall be the same as were available at the time of initial sentencing, due consideration being given to the time spent serving the order of probation. The attorney for the Commonwealth may file notice at any time prior to resentencing of the Commonwealth's intention to proceed under an applicable provision of law requiring a mandatory minimum sentence. (b.1) Nonpayment of fines or costs.-- Notwithstanding subsection (b), the court may not extend the period of probation, may not impose a brief sanction under section 9771.1 and may not revoke an order of probation solely due to nonpayment of fines or costs unless the court finds, with respect to the payment of fines, the defendant is financially able to pay the fines and has willfully refused to do so. (c) Limitation on sentence of total confinement.-- There is a presumption against total confinement for technical violations of probation. The following shall apply: (1) The court may impose a sentence of total confinement upon revocation only if: (i) the defendant has been convicted of another crime; (ii) the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant committed a technical violation that involves an identifiable threat to public safety and the defendant cannot be safely diverted from total confinement through less restrictive means; or (iii) the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed a technical violation and any of the following apply: (A) The technical violation was sexual in nature. (B) The technical violation involved assaultive behavior or included a credible threat to cause bodily injury to another, including acts committed against a family or household member. (C) The technical violation involved possession or control of a firearm or dangerous weapon. (D) The technical violation involved the manufacture, sale, delivery or possession with the intent to manufacture, sell or deliver, a controlled substance or other drug regulated under the act of April 14, 1972 (P.L.233, No.64), known as The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act. (E) The defendant absconded and cannot be safely diverted from total confinement through less restrictive means. (F) The technical violation involved an intentional and unexcused failure to adhere to recommended programming or conditions on three or more separate occasions and the defendant cannot be safely diverted from total confinement through less restrictive means. For purposes of this clause, multiple technical violations stemming from the same episode of events shall not constitute separate technical violations. (2) If a court imposes a sentence of total confinement following a revocation, the basis of which is for one or more technical violations under paragraph (1)(ii) or (iii), the court shall consider the employment status of the defendant. The defendant shall be sentenced as follows: (i) For a first technical violation, a maximum period of 14 days. (ii) For a second technical violation, a maximum period of 30 days. (iii) For a third or subsequent technical violation, the court may impose any sentencing alternatives available at the time of initial sentencing. (iv) The time limitations contained in this paragraph shall not apply to the extent that a reasonable term of additional total confinement, not to exceed 30 days, is necessary to allow a defendant to either be evaluated for or to participate in: (A) a court-ordered drug, alcohol or mental health treatment program; or (B) a problem-solving court provided for in section 916 (relating to problem-solving courts). (3) Nothing in this section shall prevent the adoption of a program under section 9771.1. (d) Hearing required.-- There shall be no revocation or increase of conditions of sentence under this section except after a hearing at which the court shall consider the record of the sentencing proceeding together with evidence of the conduct of the defendant while on probation. Probation may be eliminated or the term decreased without a hearing. (Dec. 18, 2019, P.L.776, No.115, eff. imd.; Dec. 14, 2023, P.L.381, No.44, eff. 180 days) 2023 Amendment. Act 44 amended subsecs.

The following shall apply: (1) The sentencing court may approve the petitioner's request to temporarily defer service of the sentence of confinement and place the inmate in a hospital or long-term care nursing facility under electronic monitoring by the department upon clear and convincing proof that all of the following apply: (i) The medical needs of the inmate can be more appropriately addressed in the hospital or long-term care nursing facility. (ii) The hospital or long-term care nursing facility requested by the petitioner has agreed to accept the placement of the inmate and to provide necessary medical care. (iii) The inmate is seriously ill and is expected by a treating physician to not live for more than one year. (iv) There are no writs filed or detainers lodged against the inmate and the inmate is not subject to any court order requiring the inmate's presence. (v) The placement in the hospital or long-term care nursing facility does not pose an undue risk of escape or danger to the community. In making this determination, the sentencing court shall consider the inmate's institutional conduct record, whether the inmate was ever convicted of a crime of violence, the length of time that the inmate has been imprisoned and any other factors the sentencing court deems relevant. (vi) The hospital or long-term care nursing facility has agreed to notify the department and the court of any material changes in the health status of the inmate, the nature of the care provided or other information required by the department. (vii) Each agency representing the Commonwealth at a proceeding which resulted in an order committing or detaining the inmate, the State or local correctional facility housing the inmate and any registered crime victim have been given notice and an opportunity to be heard on the petition. (2) The sentencing court may approve the petitioner's request to temporarily defer service of the sentence of confinement in order for the inmate to receive care from a licensed hospice care provider, proposed by the petitioner and subject to electronic monitoring by the department, if all of the following are established by clear and convincing proof: (i) The inmate is terminally ill, not ambulatory and likely to die in the near future. (ii) The licensed hospice care provider can provide the inmate with more appropriate care. (iii) Appropriate medical care and palliative and supportive services will be provided by the licensed hospice care provider at the proposed hospice care location. (iv) The placement of the inmate in the proposed, licensed hospice care location does not pose an undue risk of escape or danger to the community. In making this determination, the sentencing court shall consider the inmate's institutional conduct record, whether the inmate was ever convicted of a crime of violence, the length of time that the inmate has been imprisoned and any other factors the sentencing court deems relevant.

(vi) Each agency representing the Commonwealth at a proceeding which resulted in an order committing or detaining the inmate, the State or local correctional facility housing the inmate and any registered crime victim have been given notice and an opportunity to be heard on the petition.

      "text": "§ 9799.11. Legislative findings, declaration of policy and scope. (a) Legislative findings.-- The General Assembly finds as follows: (1) In 1995 the General Assembly enacted the act of October 24, 1995 (1st Sp.Sess. P.L.1079, No.24), commonly referred to as Megan's Law. Through this enactment, the General Assembly intended to comply with legislation enacted by Congress requiring that states provide for the registration of sexual offenders. The Federal statute, the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act (Public Law 103-322, 42 U.S.C. 14071 et seq.), has been superseded by the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248, 120 Stat. 587). (2) This Commonwealth's laws regarding registration of sexual offenders need to be strengthened. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 provides a mechanism for the Commonwealth to increase its regulation of sexual offenders in a manner which is nonpunitive but offers an increased measure of protection to the citizens of this Commonwealth. (3) If the public is provided adequate notice and information about sexual offenders, the community can develop constructive plans to prepare for the presence of sexual offenders in the community. This allows communities to meet with law enforcement to prepare and obtain information about the rights and responsibilities of the community and to provide education and counseling to residents, particularly children. (4) Sexual offenders pose a high risk of committing additional sexual offenses and protection of the public from this type of offender is a paramount governmental interest. (5) Sexual offenders have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public's interest in public safety and in the effective operation of government. (6) Release of information about sexual offenders to public agencies and the general public will further the governmental interests of public safety and public scrutiny of the criminal and mental health systems so long as the information released is rationally related to the furtherance of those goals. (7) Knowledge of whether a person is a sexual offender could be a significant factor in protecting oneself and one's family members, or those in care of a group or community organization, from recidivist acts by such offenders. (8) The technology afforded by the Internet and other modern electronic communication methods makes this information readily accessible to parents, minors and private entities, enabling them to undertake appropriate remedial precautions to prevent or avoid placing potential victims at risk. (b) Declaration of policy.-- The General Assembly declares as follows: (1) It is the intention of the General Assembly to substantially comply with the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and to further protect the safety and general welfare of the citizens of this Commonwealth by providing for increased regulation of sexual offenders, specifically as that regulation relates to registration of sexual offenders and community notification about sexual offenders. (2) It is the policy of the Commonwealth to require the exchange of relevant information about sexual offenders among public agencies and officials and to authorize the release of necessary and relevant information about sexual offenders to members of the general public as a means of assuring public protection and shall not be construed as punitive. (3) It is the intention of the General Assembly to address the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Neiman, No.74 MAP 2011 (Pa. 2013), by amending this subchapter in the act of March 14, 2014 (P.L.41, No.19). (4) It is the intention of the General Assembly to address the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Muniz, 164 A.3d 1189 (Pa. 2017) and the Pennsylvania Superior Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Butler (2017 WL 4914155). (c) Scope.-- This subchapter shall apply to individuals who committed a sexually violent offense on or after December 20, 2012, for which the individual was convicted. (Dec. 20, 2011, P.L.446, No.111, eff. one year; Mar. 14, 2014, P.L.41, No.19, eff. imd.; Feb. 21, 2018, P.L.27, No.10, eff. imd.; June 12, 2018, P.L.140, No.29, eff. imd.) 2021 Unconstitutionality. Section 9799.11 was declared unconstitutional as applied by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Commonwealth v. Santana, 266 A.3d 528 (Pa. 2021). 2019 Unconstitutionality. Section 9799.11 was declared unconstitutional as applied by the Pennsylvania Superior Court. Commonwealth v. Lippincott, 208 A.3d 143 (Pa. 2019). 2018 Amendments. Act 10 amended the section heading and added subsecs. (b)(4) and (c) and Act 29 reenacted the section heading and subsecs. (b)(4) and (c). Section 20(1) of Act 10 provided that the amendment of section 9799.11 shall apply to an individual who commits an offense on or after December 20, 2012. 2014 Amendment. Act 19 amended subsec. (b). 2011 Amendment. Act 111 added section 9799.11. References in Text. The citation, Commonwealth v. Butler, (2017 WL 4914155), referred to in subsec. (b)(4), was incorrectly cited as Commonwealth v. Butler (2017 WL 3882445) in Acts 10 and 29 of 2018. The parallel citation is Commonwealth v. Butler, 173 A.3d 1212 (Pa. Super. 2017).",

(a) Legislative findings.-- It is hereby determined and declared as a matter of legislative finding: (1) If the public is provided adequate notice and information about sexually violent predators and offenders as well as those sexually violent predators and offenders who do not have a fixed place of habitation or abode, the community can develop constructive plans to prepare itself for the release of sexually violent predators and offenders. This allows communities to meet with law enforcement to prepare and obtain information about the rights and responsibilities of the community and to provide education and counseling to their children. (2) These sexually violent predators and offenders pose a high risk of engaging in further offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitments, and protection of the public from this type of offender is a paramount governmental interest. (3) The penal and mental health components of our justice system are largely hidden from public view, and lack of information from either may result in failure of both systems to meet this paramount concern of public safety. (4) Overly restrictive confidentiality and liability laws governing the release of information about sexually violent predators and offenders have reduced the willingness to release information that could be appropriately released under the public disclosure laws and have increased risks to public safety. (5) Persons found to have committed a sexual offense have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public's interest in public safety and in the effective operation of government. (6) Release of information about sexually violent predators and offenders to public agencies and the general public will further the governmental interests of public safety and public scrutiny of the criminal and mental health systems so long as the information released is rationally related to the furtherance of those goals. (b) Declaration of policy.-- It is hereby declared to be the intention of the General Assembly to: (1) Protect the safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing for registration, community notification and access to information regarding sexually violent predators and offenders who are about to be released from custody and will live in or near their neighborhood. (2) Require the exchange of relevant information about sexually violent predators and offenders among public agencies and officials and to authorize the release of necessary and relevant information about sexually violent predators and offenders to members of the general public, including information available through the publicly accessible Internet website of the Pennsylvania State Police, as a means of assuring public protection and shall not be construed as punitive. (3) Address the Superior Court's opinion in the case of Commonwealth v. Wilgus, 975 A.2d 1183 (2009), by requiring sexually violent predators and offenders without a fixed place of habitation or abode to register under this subchapter. (4) Address the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Muniz, No. 47 MAP 2016 (Pa. 2016), and the Pennsylvania Superior Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Butler, 173 A.3d 1212 (Pa. Super. 2017). (June 12, 2018, P.L.140, No.29, eff. imd.) 2018 Amendment. Act 29 reenacted section 9799.51. References in Text. The citation, Commonwealth v.

The purpose of this supervision is to assist the offenders in their rehabilitation and reassimilation into the community and to protect the public. (b) Searches and seizures authorized.-- (1) Officers and, where they are responsible for the supervision of county offenders, State parole agents may search the person and property of offenders in accordance with the provisions of this section. (2) (i) Officers may search, in accordance with the provisions of this section, the person and property of any offender who accepts ARD as a result of a charge of a violation of 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 31 (relating to sexual offenses) if the court has determined that the offender shall be subject to personal and property searches as a condition of the offender's participation in the ARD program. (ii) The court shall notify each offender so offered ARD, prior to admission to an ARD program, that the offender shall be subject to searches in accordance with this section. (iii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit searches or seizures in violation of the Constitution of the United States or section 8 of Article I of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. (c) Effect of violation.-- No violation of this section shall constitute an independent ground for suppression of evidence in any probation and parole or criminal proceeding. (d) Grounds for personal search.-- (1) A personal search of an offender may be conducted by an officer: (i) if there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that the offender possesses contraband or other evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision; (ii) when an offender is transported or taken into custody; or (iii) upon an offender entering or leaving the securing enclosure of a correctional institution, jail or detention facility. (2) A property search may be conducted by an officer if there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the real or other property in the possession of or under the control of the offender contains contraband or other evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision. (3) Prior approval of a supervisor shall be obtained for a property search absent exigent circumstances. No prior approval shall be required for a personal search. (4) A written report of every property search conducted without prior approval shall be prepared by the officer who conducted the search and filed in the offender's case record. The exigent circumstances shall be stated in the report. (5) The offender may be detained if he is present during a property search. If the offender is not present during a property search, the officer in charge of the search shall make a reasonable effort to provide the offender with notice of the search, including a list of the items seized, after the search is completed. (6) The existence of reasonable suspicion to search shall be determined in accordance with constitutional search and seizure provisions as applied by judicial decision. In accordance with such case law, the following factors, where applicable, may be taken into account: (i) The observations of officers. (ii) Information provided by others. (iii) The activities of the offender. (iv) Information provided by the offender. (v) The experience of the officers with the offender. (vi) The experience of officers in similar circumstances. (vii) The prior criminal and supervisory history of the offender. (viii) The need to verify compliance with the conditions of supervision. (e) Nonresident offenders.-- No officer shall conduct a personal or property search of an offender who is residing in a foreign state except for the limited purposes permitted under the Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers. The offender is held accountable to the rules of both the sending state and the receiving state. Any personal or property search of an offender residing in another state shall be conducted by an officer of the receiving state. (e.1) Status of seized items.-- (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article XIII.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code, to the contrary, all contraband that is seized from an offender shall be considered abandoned and unclaimed, and no property right may exist in it, except as otherwise provided in this section, if the following criteria have been met: (i) The parolee or probationer from whom the item was seized is no longer under the jurisdiction of the court. (ii) Two years have elapsed from the date the parolee or probationer was no longer under the jurisdiction of the court under subparagraph (i). (iii) Notice that the item will be declared abandoned was mailed to the last known address of the parolee or probationer from whom the item was seized at least 60 days prior to the date the item is to be declared abandoned. (iv) No other claimant of the item has notified the county adult probation and parole department of his claim or is known to the county adult probation and parole department. (v) The item has not been forfeited in accordance with any forfeiture statute, including, but not limited to, Chapter 68 (relating to forfeitures) and as permitted by Pennsylvania common law. (2) Contraband seized under this section may not be subject to replevin, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the county adult probation and parole department.

(3) (i) No later than the time of the first-level hearing to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that a violation of probation, parole or intermediate punishment has been committed, the county adult probation and parole department shall provide notice to the offender that abandonment will be sought if the offender does not claim the seized contraband within two years after sentence completion. (ii) If the hearing is waived or there is a new criminal charge arising from the incident that included the seizure of the contraband, then notice under this paragraph shall be given at least five days before an abandonment hearing is held and the hearing shall be scheduled by the county adult probation and parole department within a reasonable time. (4) If it has been determined that property is contraband that shall be declared abandoned, the contraband shall be retained by the county adult probation and parole department until all appeal periods are exhausted to provide an opportunity for any additional parties to assert a claim of ownership or lienhold interest in the contraband. If the county adult probation and parole department receives notice of such a claim, the claimant or claimants shall be provided a hearing pursuant to paragraph (3). (5) (i) Whenever contraband is declared abandoned under this subchapter, the contraband shall be transferred to the custodial care of the county adult probation and parole department. After the expiration of the necessary time period specified in this section, the county adult probation and parole department shall itemize all such abandoned contraband within its custodial care in a report to the Treasury Department. (ii) Within 10 business days following receipt of an itemized contraband report from a county adult probation and parole department, the Treasury Department shall provide an itemized list of all such abandoned contraband that it will not accept into its custodial care. (iii) All abandoned contraband not accepted by the Treasury Department pursuant to this section shall remain under the custodial control of the county adult probation and parole department. Abandoned contraband not otherwise refused by the Treasury Department shall be transferred to the custodial control of the Treasury Department as directed by the Treasury Department. (6) All abandoned contraband refused by the Treasury Department and remaining under the custodial control of the county adult probation and parole department shall be deemed property of the county department and title to the property shall transfer.

(iii) Donate the contraband to a nonprofit organization or governmental entity. (iv) Sell any contraband that is not required to be destroyed by law. (v) If the item is of de minimis value, as determined by the county adult probation and parole department, dispose of the item, without sale. (7) The county treasurer of each county shall establish and administer a community correction forfeiture fund consisting of all cash or proceeds obtained under this section. The county treasurer shall disburse money from this fund only at the discretion of the president judge of the court of common pleas, subject to paragraph (8). (8) Cash or proceeds generated by the sale of any abandoned contraband shall first be made available to satisfy any restitution owed by the offender to crime victims who are known at the time of the seizure by the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency's Office of Victim Services or by the courts of the Commonwealth where the offender was sentenced. (9) The county adult probation and parole department and its employees shall be immune from liability for good faith conduct under this section. (10) The Department of Corrections may enact regulations that are necessary to implement this subsection on a uniform basis throughout this Commonwealth. If regulations are promulgated, a county adult probation and parole department must comply with the regulations. (11) The provisions set forth in this subsection shall apply to all contraband seized after the effective date of this subsection. (12) Contraband seized prior to the effective date of this subsection may be disposed of in the manner set forth in paragraph (5) after notice is given to the offender from whom it was seized and any claimant known to the county adult probation and parole department. The county adult probation and parole department shall provide the notice within a reasonable time prior to holding a hearing at which abandonment shall be determined. (13) (i) An appeal of an abandonment determination may be made by filing an appeal with the court of common pleas. The appeal must be received by the court of common pleas within 30 days of the mailing date of the county adult probation and parole department's order. (ii) When a timely appeal of an abandonment determination has been filed, the abandonment may not be deemed final for purpose of appeal to a court until the court has mailed its decision on the appeal. (iii) The scope of review of an appeal shall be limited to whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence, an error of law has been committed or there has been a violation of constitutional law. (iv) The failure of an appeal to present with accuracy, brevity, clearness and specificity whatever is essential to a ready and adequate understanding of the factual and legal points requiring consideration shall be a sufficient reason for denying the appeal. (v) A second or subsequent appeal and an appeal that is untimely filed under this paragraph shall not be received. (vi) The procedure for appeal contained in this subsection may not be construed to alter or replace any procedures provided by law for the timely filing of appeals to appellate courts. (14) The county adult probation and parole department shall annually post a report specifying the abandoned property or proceeds of the abandoned property obtained under this section on the county's publicly accessible Internet website and make the report available as a public document. The report shall give an accounting of all proceeds derived from the sale of abandoned property and the use made of unsold abandoned property. (f) When authority is effective.-- The authority granted to the officers under this section shall be effective upon enactment of this section, without the necessity of any further regulation by the board.

Within 30 days of the date specified in section 1905(a) (relating to county-level court administrators), each employing county shall provide, in writing, to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, all leave information requested by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania for those individuals designated in section 1905(a). The payment to be made by each employing county shall be determined based upon an actuarial evaluation performed by an actuary appointed by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania from a list of three actuaries to be submitted by the Secretary of the Budget within 30 days of the effective date of this subchapter. The actuarial evaluation shall be based upon assumptions determined by the actuary to be appropriate under the circumstances to arrive at a fair and reasonable determination of an actuarially equivalent value of the accrued sick leave and annual leave transferred and credited under section 2394. The actuary shall submit the actuarial evaluation to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts within 60 days of the receipt of all information necessary to prepare such evaluation. If any employing county fails to provide the information required by this section, the county shall be subject to a penalty of $100 per day for each transferred employee until the required information is provided. Such penalties shall be paid into the fund. (b) Notice of payment due and payment method.-- Following receipt of the actuarial evaluation required by subsection (a), the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts shall notify in writing each employing county of the actuarial value attributable to that county for accrued sick leave and annual leave transferred and credited under section 2394. Each employing county shall be obligated to the Commonwealth for payment of the actuarial value of the accrued sick leave and annual leave transferred and credited under section 2394. Payment shall be made to the Commonwealth by each employing county within 90 days of the date of the written notice from the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts to the employing county, which date is referred to for purposes of this section as the payment due date.

Any moneys withheld or withdrawn under this subsection or received under subsection (b) shall be transferred to and deposited in the fund created under subsection (d) and credited to the employing county's financial obligation under this subchapter. (d) Establishment of fund.-- There is hereby created a special nonlapsing fund in the State Treasury to be known as the Unified Judicial System Transferred County-Level Administrator Leave Fund. All moneys received from employing counties under this section and all investment income earned on those moneys shall be deposited in the fund. All moneys placed in the fund and the investment income it accrues are hereby appropriated on a continuing basis to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, upon requisition by the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania, to be applied solely to the cost of leave payments made under section 2396(c) (relating to leave following transfer). The requisition authority granted with regard to the fund is in addition to the requisition authority contained in section 1501 of The Fiscal Code. (e) Fund deficiency.-- If money in the fund is not adequate to provide for full payment of the counties' share of leave payments, the amount necessary to fully fund the counties' share of leave payments shall become an obligation of the unified judicial system. (f) Fund surplus.-- When all leave payments for transferred administrators required to be made under this subchapter have been made, any surplus remaining in the fund shall be transferred to and is hereby appropriated to the General Fund.

In the event counsel of the witness' choice is not available, he shall be required to obtain other counsel within a reasonable time in order that the work of the grand jury may proceed. (2) Such counsel may be retained by the witness or shall be appointed in the case of any person unable to procure sufficient funds to obtain legal representation. (3) Such counsel shall be allowed to be present in the grand jury room during the questioning of the witness and shall be allowed to advise the witness but shall make no objections or arguments or otherwise address the grand jury or the attorney for the Commonwealth. The supervising judge shall have the same power to remove such counsel from the grand jury room as a judge has with respect to an attorney in any court proceeding. Violation of this paragraph shall be punishable as contempt by the supervising judge. (4) An attorney, or attorneys who are associated in practice, shall not continue multiple representation of clients in a grand jury proceeding if the exercise of the independent professional judgment of an attorney on behalf of one of the clients will or is likely to be adversely affected by his representation of another client. If the supervising judge determines that the interest of an individual will or is likely to be adversely affected, he may order separate representation of witnesses, giving appropriate weight to the right of an individual to counsel of his own choosing. (d) Disclosure of proceedings by witnesses.-- No witness shall be prohibited from disclosing his testimony before the investigating grand jury except for cause shown in a hearing before the supervising judge. In no event may a witness be prevented from disclosing his testimony to his attorney.",

(a) General rule.-- If a defendant in a criminal prosecution fails to appear for any scheduled court proceeding, the defendant's bail may be revoked and notice of revocation shall serve as notice of intent to forfeit the bail of the defendant. The notice or order of revocation shall be served by the office of the clerk to the defendant, surety or bail bondsman and insurer who has issued the qualifying power of attorney for the bail bondsman by certified mail, return receipt requested. (b) Payment.-- The following shall apply: (1) Ninety days from the date of the service of the notice of revocation or order of revocation, the revocation shall become a judgment of forfeiture, payment of which shall be immediately required by the defendant or surety. Failure of a bail bondsman to make a timely payment of a forfeiture judgment shall result in the district attorney or county solicitor commencing proceedings to suspend or nonrenew the license of the bail bondsman otherwise consistent with section 5746 (relating to suspension or revocation of authority to conduct business in a county). (2) Payment of forfeited undertaking shall be made directly to the office of the clerk not later than the close of business on the 91st day following the service of the notice of revocation. If the defendant has been recovered and placed into custody through the efforts of the bail bondsman or proof has been provided to the court that the defendant was discovered by the bail bondsman to be in custody in another jurisdiction prior to the 91st day, no payment of the forfeited undertaking shall be required. If the defendant is placed into custody or discovered to be in custody, the court shall set aside the bail revocation and may release the defendant with the reinstitution of bail pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. The bail bondsman shall not be continued by the court as surety on reinstated bail unless a written consent is signed by the bail bondsman agreeing to such extension of suretyship. (3) Failure to render payment of the forfeited undertaking by close of business on the 91st day shall bar any right of remission to collect funds pursuant to the forfeited undertaking. (4) The office of the clerk shall provide a summary quarterly statement of all overdue forfeited undertakings which have not been paid by each bail bondsman and insurer. The bail bondsman or insurer shall be afforded 30 days from the date of the statement to render payment of the forfeited undertakings. Failure to render payment by close of business on the 31st day shall result in suspension of the ability to conduct business of both the bail bondsman and the insurer in that judicial district until such time as payment is rendered in full. The bail bondsman may be subject to formal suspension or nonrenewal proceedings pursuant to section 5746. In addition, the insurer may be subjected to further administrative penalties, to be determined by the department, consistent with the act of July 22, 1974 (P.L.589, No.205), known as the Unfair Insurance Practices Act, or other applicable law. (5) If the defendant is recovered after the 91st day following the forfeiture, a surety may petition the court in which the revocation and forfeiture occurred to remit all or a portion of the funds collected in exchange for the absence of the defendant. The court shall remit payment as follows: (i) If the defendant is recovered between the 91st day and six months after the order of revocation or forfeiture, the surety shall recover the full value of the forfeited amount of the bond, less an administrative fee in the amount of $250. (ii) If the defendant is recovered between six months and one year after the order of revocation or forfeiture, the surety shall recover 80% of the value of the forfeited amount of the bond. (iii) If the defendant is recovered between one and two years after the order of revocation or forfeiture, the surety shall recover 50% of the value of the forfeited amount of the bond. (6) No third-party surety shall be responsible to render payment on a forfeited undertaking if the revocation of bail is sought for failure of the defendant to comply with the conditions of the defendant's release other than appearance. Any violation of performance conditions by a defendant shall be deemed as a violation of a court order, subject to a conviction for indirect contempt of court for violating a court order instituting terms and conditions of release of the defendant and all associated penalties.

Examination and cross-examination of the child victim or child material witness shall proceed in the same manner as normally permitted. The court shall make certain that the defendant and defense counsel have adequate opportunity to communicate for the purpose of providing an effective defense. (b) Determination.-- Before the court orders the child victim or the child material witness to testify by recorded testimony, the court must determine, based on evidence presented to it, that testifying either in an open forum in the presence and full view of the finder of fact or in the defendant's presence will result in the child victim or child material witness suffering serious emotional distress that would substantially impair the child victim's or child material witness's ability to reasonably communicate.

(a) General rule.-- (1) An out-of-court statement made by a child victim or witness, who at the time the statement was made was 16 years of age or younger, describing any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (2), not otherwise admissible by statute or rule of evidence, is admissible in evidence in any criminal or civil proceeding if: (i) the court finds, in an in camera hearing, that the evidence is relevant and that the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient indicia of reliability; and (ii) the child either: (A) testifies at the proceeding; or (B) is unavailable as a witness. (2) The following offenses under 18 Pa.C.S. (relating to crimes and offenses) shall apply to paragraph (1): Chapter 25 (relating to criminal homicide). Chapter 27 (relating to assault).

(a.1) Emotional distress.-- In order to make a finding under subsection (a)(1)(ii)(B) that the child is unavailable as a witness, the court must determine, based on evidence presented to it, that testimony by the child as a witness will result in the child suffering serious emotional distress that would substantially impair the child's ability to reasonably communicate. In making this determination, the court may do all of the following: (1) Observe and question the child, either inside or outside the courtroom. (2) Hear testimony of a parent or custodian or any other person, such as a person who has dealt with the child in a medical or therapeutic setting. (a.2) Counsel and confrontation.-- If the court hears testimony in connection with making a finding under subsection (a)(1)(ii)(B), all of the following apply: (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the defendant, the attorney for the defendant and the attorney for the Commonwealth or, in the case of a civil proceeding, the attorney for the plaintiff has the right to be present.

(2) Unless otherwise prohibited under this chapter or by the statutes or regulations listed under subsection (b)(2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) or any other provision of law, the information under paragraph (1) may also be shared with other agencies or entities if there is a specific need to do so.

The facility shall notify the court by the close of the next business day. (e) Revocation of transfer.-- Upon receiving notice pursuant to subsection (d) that the person has violated a material term or condition of transfer specified pursuant to subsection (a) or that the person is having serious difficulty controlling sexually violent behavior in an outpatient setting due to a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in an act of sexual violence, the court shall revoke the transfer to involuntary outpatient treatment and order the immediate return to involuntary inpatient treatment without a prior hearing.

(b) Continuing.-- An arbitrator has a continuing obligation to disclose to all parties to the agreement to arbitrate and the arbitration proceeding and to other arbitrators facts that the arbitrator learns after accepting appointment that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator. (c) Objection.-- If an arbitrator discloses a fact required by subsection (a) or (b) to be disclosed and a party timely objects to the appointment or continued service of the arbitrator based upon the fact disclosed, the objection may be a ground under section 7321.24(a)(2) (relating to vacating award) for vacating an award made by the arbitrator.

The authority conferred upon the arbitrator includes the power to hold conferences with the parties to the arbitration proceeding before the hearing and, among other matters, determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence. (b) Summary disposition.-- An arbitrator may decide a request for summary disposition of a claim or particular issue: (1) if all interested parties agree; or (2) upon request of one party to the arbitration proceeding if that party gives notice to all other parties to the proceeding and if the other parties have a reasonable opportunity to respond. (c) Notice and hearing.-- If an arbitrator orders a hearing, the arbitrator shall set a time and place and give notice of the hearing not less than five days before the hearing begins. Unless a party to the arbitration proceeding makes an objection to lack or insufficiency of notice not later than the beginning of the hearing, the party's appearance at the hearing waives the objection. Upon request of a party to the arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, or upon the arbitrator's own initiative, the arbitrator may adjourn the hearing as necessary but may not postpone the hearing to a time later than that fixed by the agreement to arbitrate for making the award unless the parties to the arbitration proceeding consent to a later date. The arbitrator may hear and decide the controversy upon the evidence produced although a party who was notified of the arbitration proceeding did not appear. The court, on request, may direct the arbitrator to conduct the hearing promptly and render a timely decision. (d) Procedure.-- At a hearing under subsection (c), a party to the arbitration proceeding has a right to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing. (e) Replacement.-- If an arbitrator ceases or is unable to act during the arbitration proceeding, a replacement arbitrator must be appointed in accordance with section 7321.12 (relating to appointment of arbitrator; service as a neutral arbitrator) to continue the proceeding and to resolve the controversy. (f) Location for arbitration hearing for consumer transactions.-- A hearing conducted under an arbitration agreement applicable to a consumer transaction shall be held at a location reasonably convenient to the consumer.

(c) Discovery.-- An arbitrator may permit discovery as the arbitrator decides is appropriate in the circumstances, taking into account the needs of the parties to the arbitration proceeding and other affected persons and the desirability of making the proceeding fair, expeditious and cost effective. (d) Compliance with discovery.-- If an arbitrator permits discovery under subsection (c), the arbitrator may order a party to the arbitration proceeding to comply with the arbitrator's discovery-related orders, issue subpoenas for the attendance of a witness and for the production of records and other evidence at a discovery proceeding and take action against a noncomplying party to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this Commonwealth.

(2) A communication sought or offered to prove facts relating to the abuse, neglect, abandonment or exploitation of a child or abuse of an adult. (3) A communication sought or offered in a criminal proceeding or in an action to enforce, void, set aside or modify a settlement agreement where a tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction finds that the evidence is not otherwise available and the need for the evidence substantially outweighs the interest in protecting the privilege. (e) Limitation.-- (1) If a collaborative communication is subject to an exception under subsection (d), only the part of the collaborative communication necessary for the application of the exception may be disclosed or admitted. (2) Disclosure or admission of evidence under subsection (d) does not make the evidence or any other collaborative communication discoverable or admissible for any other purpose.

The availability of declaratory relief shall not be limited by the provisions of 1 Pa.C.S. § 1504 (relating to statutory remedy preferred over common law) and the remedy provided by this subchapter shall be additional and cumulative to all other available remedies except as provided in subsection (c). Where another remedy is available the election of the declaratory judgment remedy rather than another available remedy shall not affect the substantive rights of the parties, and the court may pursuant to general rules change venue, require additional pleadings, fix the order of discovery and proof, and take such other action as may be required in the interest of justice. (c) Exceptions.-- Relief shall not be available under this subchapter with respect to any: (1) Action wherein a divorce or annulment of marriage is sought except as provided by 23 Pa.C.S. § 3306 (relating to proceedings to determine marital status). (2) Proceeding within the exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal other than a court. (3) Proceeding involving an appeal from an order of a tribunal.

The Administrative Office shall cause all orders of the Supreme Court entered under this subsection to be codified in the Pennsylvania Code.

The district attorney or his designee shall have the duty to inquire into and make full examination of all the facts and circumstances connected with each such case to determine if the facts and circumstances warrant the filing of an information or informations premised upon the transcript.

      "text": "§ 9543.1. Postconviction DNA testing. (a) Motion.-- (1) An individual convicted of a criminal offense in a court of this Commonwealth may apply by making a written motion to the sentencing court at any time for the performance of forensic DNA testing on specific evidence that is related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment of conviction. (2) The evidence may have been discovered either prior to or after the applicant's conviction. The evidence shall be available for testing as of the date of the motion. If the evidence was discovered prior to the applicant's conviction, the evidence shall not have been subject to the DNA testing requested because the technology for testing was not in existence at the time of the trial or the applicant's counsel did not seek testing at the time of the trial in a case where a verdict was rendered on or before January 1, 1995, or the evidence was subject to the testing, but newer technology could provide substantially more accurate and substantially probative results, or the applicant's counsel sought funds from the court to pay for the testing because his client was indigent and the court refused the request despite the client's indigency. (3) A request for DNA testing under this section shall be by written petition and shall be filed with the clerk of courts of the judicial district where the sentence is imposed. (4) DNA testing may be sought at any time if the motion is made in a timely manner and for the purpose of demonstrating the applicant's actual innocence and not to delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a plea of guilty to a crime of violence, as defined in section 9714(g) (relating to sentences for second and subsequent offenses), or a confession given by an applicant concerning the offense for which the applicant was convicted, shall not prohibit the applicant from asserting actual innocence under subsection (c)(2) or the court from making a determination and ordering DNA testing under subsection (d)(2). (6) The motion shall explain how, after review of the record of the applicant's trial, there is a reasonable possibility if the applicant is under State supervision, or there is a reasonable probability if the applicant is not under State supervision, or after review of the record of the applicant's guilty plea there is a reasonable probability, that the testing would produce exculpatory evidence that would establish: (i) the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted; (ii) in a capital case, the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) (relating to sentencing procedure for murder of the first degree) if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence of death; or (iii) in a capital case, a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) under the circumstances set forth in section 9711(c)(1)(iv). (b) Notice to the Commonwealth.-- (1) Upon receipt of a motion under subsection (a), the court shall notify the Commonwealth and shall afford the Commonwealth an opportunity to respond to the motion. (2) Upon receipt of a motion under subsection (a) or notice of the motion, as applicable, the Commonwealth and the court shall take the steps reasonably necessary to ensure that any remaining biological material in the possession of the Commonwealth or the court is preserved pending the completion of the proceedings under this section. (c) Requirements.-- In any motion under subsection (a), under penalty of perjury, the applicant shall: (1) (i) specify the evidence to be tested; (ii) state that the applicant consents to provide samples of bodily fluid for use in the DNA testing; and (iii) acknowledge that the applicant understands that, if the motion is granted, any data obtained from any DNA samples or test results may be entered into law enforcement databases, may be used in the investigation of other crimes and may be used as evidence against the applicant in other cases. (2) (i) in a sworn statement subject to the penalties under 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 4902 (relating to perjury) and 4903 (relating to false swearing), assert the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted and that the applicant seeks DNA testing for the purpose of demonstrating the applicant's actual innocence; and (ii) in a capital case: (A) assert the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence of death; or (B) assert that the outcome of the DNA testing would establish a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) if that mitigating circumstance was presented to the sentencing judge or jury and facts as to that issue were in dispute at the sentencing hearing. (3) present a prima facie case demonstrating that the: (i) identity of or the participation in the crime by the perpetrator was at issue in the proceedings that resulted in the applicant's conviction and sentencing; and (ii) DNA testing of the specific evidence, assuming exculpatory results, would establish: (A) the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted; (B) in a capital case, the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence of death; or (C) in a capital case, a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) under the circumstances set forth in section 9711(c)(1)(iv). (d) Order.-- (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the court shall order the testing requested in a motion under subsection (a) under reasonable conditions designed to preserve the integrity of the evidence and the testing process upon a determination, after review of the record of the applicant's trial, that the: (i) requirements of subsection (c) have been met; (ii) evidence to be tested has been subject to a chain of custody sufficient to establish that it has not been altered in any material respect; and (iii) motion is made in a timely manner and for the purpose of demonstrating the applicant's actual innocence and not to delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice. (2) The court shall not order the testing requested in a motion under subsection (a) if, after review of the record of the applicant's trial, the court determines that there is no reasonable possibility for an applicant under State supervision, or there is no reasonable probability for an applicant not under State supervision, or after review of the record of the applicant's guilty plea, the court determines that there is no reasonable probability, that the testing would produce exculpatory evidence that: (i) would establish the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted; (ii) in a capital case, would establish the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence of death; or (iii) in a capital case, would establish a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) under the circumstances set forth in section 9711(c)(1)(iv). (3) Any DNA testing order under this section shall constitute a final order. An applicant or the Commonwealth may appeal a decision denying or granting a DNA testing order in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure. (4) Any decision granting or denying a DNA testing order shall include an explanation by the court of how the testing requested in a motion under subsection (a) has met or fails to have met the requirements under paragraphs (1), (2) and (3). (5) Upon determining the petitioner has met the applicable burden established in paragraph (1) or (2), the court may require the Commonwealth to prepare an inventory of evidence related to the case and serve a copy of the inventory to the prosecution, the applicant, the applicant's attorney, if applicable, and the court. The inventory may include, but not be limited to, a list of evidence collected and forensic testing previously done relating to the evidence and the names of agencies that conducted the forensic testing. (e) Testing procedures.-- (1) Any DNA testing ordered under this section shall be conducted by: (i) a laboratory mutually selected by the Commonwealth and the applicant; (ii) a laboratory selected by the court that ordered the testing if the Commonwealth and the applicant are unable to agree on a laboratory; or (iii) if the applicant is indigent, the testing shall be conducted by the Pennsylvania State Police or, at the Pennsylvania State Police's sole discretion, by a laboratory designated by the Pennsylvania State Police. (2) The costs of any testing ordered under this section shall be paid: (i) by the applicant; or (ii) in the case of an applicant who is indigent, by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (3) To the extent possible and not inconsistent with best laboratory practices, the testing shall be conducted in a manner that ensures that some portion of the sample is preserved for replication of testing. If the laboratory determines it may be necessary to consume the entirety of any sample during testing, the laboratory shall inform the prosecution, the applicant and the applicant's attorney, if applicable, of its recommendation and obtain the prosecution and the applicant's consent before proceeding. If the prosecution and the applicant do not consent, the court may issue any appropriate order before testing proceeds. (4) If testing is performed by a private laboratory and a DNA database search is anticipated, the applicant shall ensure that the chosen laboratory is accredited by an accreditation body that is a signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation Mutual Recognition Agreement that is designated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with 34 U.S.C. § 12591 (relating to quality assurance and proficiency testing standards), that requires conformance to forensic science requirements and that the accreditation include DNA testing, and is compliant with Federal Bureau of Investigation quality assurance standards. (5) When testing is performed by a private laboratory, the public laboratory shall take all reasonable measures before the testing is conducted to ensure that the results of the testing may be entered into CODIS so that a comparison to known offender or crime scene profiles may be made if the laboratory and test results otherwise satisfy the criteria for database entry. (6) Testing conducted by the Pennsylvania State Police shall be carried out in accordance with the protocols and procedures established by the Pennsylvania State Police. (7) To the extent possible, if communication with the parties regarding the testing process and test results is necessary, the testing laboratory shall communicate with counsel for petitioner and the Commonwealth simultaneously. (8) No direct communication involving the testing laboratory without the inclusion of a representative of each party shall occur. (f) Posttesting procedures.-- (1) After the DNA testing conducted under this section has been completed, the applicant may, pursuant to section 9545(b)(2) (relating to jurisdiction and proceedings), during the one-year period beginning on the date on which the applicant is notified of the test results, petition to the court for postconviction relief pursuant to section 9543(a)(2)(vi) (relating to eligibility for relief). (2) Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the court shall consider the petition along with any answer filed by the Commonwealth and shall conduct a hearing thereon. (3) In any hearing on a petition for postconviction relief filed under paragraph (1), the court shall determine whether the exculpatory evidence resulting from the DNA testing conducted under this section would have changed the outcome of the trial as required by section 9543(a)(2)(vi). (4) If testing complies with Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements and the data meets NDIS criteria, profiles obtained from the testing shall be searched or uploaded to CODIS. (5) When testing is conducted by a private laboratory, a court may order a public laboratory with access to CODIS to take the necessary measures to ensure the DNA profile obtained from probative biological material from crime scene evidence can be uploaded to CODIS by the public laboratory. Necessary measures may include requiring the public laboratory to conduct a review of the private laboratory's facilities or records to ensure that the private laboratory complies with Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements regarding CODIS. If the private laboratory meets Federal Bureau of Investigation and CODIS requirements, the court may order the public laboratory to upload the DNA profile to determine whether the profile matches a profile of a known individual or a profile from an unsolved crime. The DNA profile submitted to the databases must comply with the Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements for the uploading of DNA profiles to CODIS, and the Commonwealth shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that the testing complies with the requirements. (6) If DNA testing conclusively identifies the DNA profile of the applicant on probative and inculpatory evidence, the court shall dismiss the petition and may make any further orders that are appropriate. An order under this paragraph may: (i) direct that the Pennsylvania Parole Board be notified of the test results; or (ii) mandate that the applicant's DNA profile be added to the Commonwealth's convicted offender database. (g) Effect of motion.-- The filing of a motion for forensic DNA testing pursuant to subsection (a) shall have the following effect: (1) The filing of the motion shall constitute the applicant's consent to provide samples of bodily fluid for use in the DNA testing. (2) The data from any DNA samples or test results obtained as a result of the motion may be entered into law enforcement databases, may be used in the investigation of other crimes and may be used as evidence against the applicant in other cases.

(a) Mandatory sentence.-- (1) Any person who is convicted in any court of this Commonwealth of an offense set forth in section 9799.14 (relating to sexual offenses and tier system) shall, if at the time of the commission of the current offense the person had previously been convicted of an offense set forth in section 9799.14 or an equivalent crime under the laws of this Commonwealth in effect at the time of the commission of that offense or an equivalent crime in another jurisdiction, be sentenced to a minimum sentence of at least 25 years of total confinement, notwithstanding any other provision of this title or other statute to the contrary. Upon such conviction, the court shall give the person oral and written notice of the penalties under paragraph (2) for a third conviction. Failure to provide such notice shall not render the offender ineligible to be sentenced under paragraph (2). (2) Where the person had at the time of the commission of the current offense previously been convicted of two or more offenses arising from separate criminal transactions set forth in section 9799.14 or equivalent crimes under the laws of this Commonwealth in effect at the time of the commission of the offense or equivalent crimes in another jurisdiction, the person shall be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment, notwithstanding any other provision of this title or other statute to the contrary. Proof that the offender received notice of or otherwise knew or should have known of the penalties under this paragraph shall not be required. (b) Mandatory maximum.-- An offender sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence under this section shall be sentenced to a maximum sentence equal to twice the mandatory minimum sentence, notwithstanding 18 Pa.C.S. § 1103 (relating to sentence of imprisonment for felony) or any other provision of this title or other statute to the contrary. (c) Proof of sentencing.-- The provisions of this section shall not be an element of the crime, and notice thereof to the defendant shall not be required prior to conviction, but reasonable notice of the Commonwealth's intention to proceed under this section shall be provided after conviction and before sentencing. The applicability of this section shall be determined at sentencing. The sentencing court, prior to imposing sentence on an offender under subsection (a), shall have a complete record of the previous convictions of the offender, copies of which shall be furnished to the offender. If the offender or the attorney for the Commonwealth contests the accuracy of the record, the court shall schedule a hearing and direct the offender and the attorney for the Commonwealth to submit evidence regarding the previous convictions of the offender. The court shall then determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, the previous convictions of the offender and, if this section is applicable, shall impose sentence in accordance with this section.

(d) Authority of court in sentencing.-- There shall be no authority in any court to impose on an offender to which this section is applicable any lesser sentence than provided for in subsections (a) and (b) or to place the offender on probation or to suspend sentence. Nothing in this section shall prevent the sentencing court from imposing a sentence greater than that provided in this section. Sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing shall not supersede the mandatory sentences provided in this section. (e) Appeal by Commonwealth.-- If a sentencing court shall refuse to apply this section where applicable, the Commonwealth shall have the right to appellate review of the action of the sentencing court. The appellate court shall vacate the sentence and remand the case to the sentencing court for the imposition of a sentence in accordance with this section if it finds that the sentence was imposed in violation of this section.

      "text": "§ 9714. Sentences for second and subsequent offenses. (a) Mandatory sentence.-- (1) Any person who is convicted in any court of this Commonwealth of a crime of violence shall, if at the time of the commission of the current offense the person had previously been convicted of a crime of violence, be sentenced to a minimum sentence of at least ten years of total confinement, notwithstanding any other provision of this title or other statute to the contrary. Upon a second conviction for a crime of violence, the court shall give the person oral and written notice of the penalties under this section for a third conviction for a crime of violence. Failure to provide such notice shall not render the offender ineligible to be sentenced under paragraph (2). (2) Where the person had at the time of the commission of the current offense previously been convicted of two or more such crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions, the person shall be sentenced to a minimum sentence of at least 25 years of total confinement, notwithstanding any other provision of this title or other statute to the contrary. Proof that the offender received notice of or otherwise knew or should have known of the penalties under this paragraph shall not be required. Upon conviction for a third or subsequent crime of violence the court may, if it determines that 25 years of total confinement is insufficient to protect the public safety, sentence the offender to life imprisonment without parole. (a.1) Mandatory maximum.-- An offender sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence under this section shall be sentenced to a maximum sentence equal to twice the mandatory minimum sentence, notwithstanding 18 Pa.C.S. § 1103 (relating to sentence of imprisonment for felony) or any other provision of this title or other statute to the contrary. (b) Presumption of high risk dangerous offender.-- (Deleted by amendment). (c) High risk dangerous offender.-- (Deleted by amendment). (d) Proof at sentencing.-- Provisions of this section shall not be an element of the crime and notice thereof to the defendant shall not be required prior to conviction, but reasonable notice of the Commonwealth's intention to proceed under this section shall be provided after conviction and before sentencing. The applicability of this section shall be determined at sentencing. The sentencing court, prior to imposing sentence on an offender under subsection (a), shall have a complete record of the previous convictions of the offender, copies of which shall be furnished to the offender. If the offender or the attorney for the Commonwealth contests the accuracy of the record, the court shall schedule a hearing and direct the offender and the attorney for the Commonwealth to submit evidence regarding the previous convictions of the offender. The court shall then determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, the previous convictions of the offender and, if this section is applicable, shall impose sentence in accordance with this section. Should a previous conviction be vacated and an acquittal or final discharge entered subsequent to imposition of sentence under this section, the offender shall have the right to petition the sentencing court for reconsideration of sentence if this section would not have been applicable except for the conviction which was vacated. (e) Authority of court in sentencing.-- There shall be no authority in any court to impose on an offender to which this section is applicable any lesser sentence than provided for in subsections (a) and (a.1) or to place such offender on probation or to suspend sentence. Nothing in this section shall prevent the sentencing court from imposing a sentence greater than that provided in this section. Sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing shall not supersede the mandatory sentences provided in this section. (f) Appeal by Commonwealth.-- If a sentencing court shall refuse to apply this section where applicable, the Commonwealth shall have the right to appellate review of the action of the sentencing court. The appellate court shall vacate the sentence and remand the case to the sentencing court for the imposition of a sentence in accordance with this section if it finds that the sentence was imposed in violation of this section. (g) Definition.-- As used in this section, the term \"crime of violence\" means murder of the third degree, voluntary manslaughter, manslaughter of a law enforcement officer as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2507(c) or (d) (relating to criminal homicide of law enforcement officer), murder of the third degree involving an unborn child as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2604(c) (relating to murder of unborn child), aggravated assault of an unborn child as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2606 (relating to aggravated assault of unborn child), aggravated assault as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1) or (2) (relating to aggravated assault), assault of law enforcement officer as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702.1(a)(1) (relating to assault of law enforcement officer), use of weapons of mass destruction as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2716(b) (relating to weapons of mass destruction), terrorism as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2717(b)(2) (relating to terrorism), strangulation when the offense is graded as a felony as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2718 (relating to strangulation), trafficking of persons when the offense is graded as a felony of the first degree as provided in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3011 (relating to trafficking in individuals), rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, incest, sexual assault, arson endangering persons or aggravated arson as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3301(a) or (a.1) (relating to arson and related offenses), ecoterrorism as classified in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3311(b)(3) (relating to ecoterrorism), kidnapping, burglary as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(1) (relating to burglary), robbery as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3701(a)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) (relating to robbery), or robbery of a motor vehicle, drug delivery resulting in death as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2506(a) (relating to drug delivery resulting in death), or criminal attempt, criminal conspiracy or criminal solicitation to commit murder or any of the offenses listed above, or an equivalent crime under the laws of this Commonwealth in effect at the time of the commission of that offense or an equivalent crime in another jurisdiction.

      "text": "§ 9721. Sentencing generally. (a) General rule.-- In determining the sentence to be imposed the court shall, except as provided in subsection (a.1), consider and select one or more of the following alternatives, and may impose them consecutively or concurrently: (1) An order of probation. (2) A determination of guilt without further penalty. (3) Partial confinement. (4) Total confinement. (5) A fine. (6) (Deleted by amendment). (7) (Deleted by amendment). (a.1) Exception.-- (1) Unless specifically authorized under section 9763 (relating to conditions of probation), subsection (a) shall not apply where a mandatory minimum sentence is otherwise provided by law. (2) A person may be eligible for the State drug treatment program or State motivational boot camp as described in 61 Pa.C.S. Ch. 39 (relating to motivational boot camp), even if a mandatory minimum sentence would otherwise be provided by law. (3) An eligible person may be sentenced to total confinement pursuant to subsection (a)(4) and a recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum sentence pursuant to section 9756(b.1) (relating to sentence of total confinement), even if a mandatory minimum sentence would otherwise be provided by law. (b) General standards.-- In selecting from the alternatives set forth in subsection (a), the court shall follow the general principle that the sentence imposed should call for total confinement that is consistent with section 9725 (relating to total confinement) and the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense as it relates to the impact on the life of the victim and on the community, and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant. The court shall also consider any guidelines for sentencing and resentencing adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing and taking effect under section 2155 (relating to publication of guidelines for sentencing, resentencing and parole, risk assessment instrument and recommitment ranges following revocation). In every case in which the court imposes a sentence for a felony or misdemeanor, modifies a sentence, resentences a person following revocation of probation or resentences following remand, the court shall make as a part of the record, and disclose in open court at the time of sentencing, a statement of the reason or reasons for the sentence imposed. In every case where the court imposes a sentence or resentence outside the guidelines adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing under sections 2154 (relating to adoption of guidelines for sentencing), 2154.1 (relating to adoption of guidelines for restrictive conditions), 2154.3 (relating to adoption of guidelines for fines), 2154.4 (relating to adoption of guidelines for resentencing) and 2154.5 (relating to adoption of guidelines for parole) and made effective under section 2155, the court shall provide a contemporaneous written statement of the reason or reasons for the deviation from the guidelines to the commission, as established under section 2153(a)(14) (relating to powers and duties). Failure to comply shall be grounds for vacating the sentence or resentence and resentencing the defendant. (c) Mandatory restitution.-- In addition to the alternatives set forth in subsection (a) of this section the court shall order the defendant to compensate the victim of his criminal conduct for the damage or injury that he sustained. For purposes of this subsection, the term \"victim\" shall be as defined in section 479.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929. (c.1) Mandatory payment of costs.-- Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9728 (relating to collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties) or any provision of law to the contrary, in addition to the alternatives set forth in subsection (a), the court shall order the defendant to pay costs. In the event the court fails to issue an order for costs pursuant to section 9728, costs shall be imposed upon the defendant under this section. No court order shall be necessary for the defendant to incur liability for costs under this section. The provisions of this subsection do not alter the court's discretion under Pa.R.Crim.P. No. 706(C) (relating to fines or costs). (d) Detailed criteria.-- With respect to each alternative the criteria to be considered by the court are set forth in this subchapter. (e) Term of imprisonment.-- All sentences of imprisonment imposed under this chapter shall be for a definite term. (Nov. 26, 1978, P.L.1316, No.319, eff.

(2) The defendant did not contemplate that his conduct would cause or threaten serious harm. (3) The defendant acted under a strong provocation. (4) There were substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the criminal conduct of the defendant, though failing to establish a defense. (5) The victim of the criminal conduct of the defendant induced or facilitated its commission. (6) The defendant has compensated or will compensate the victim of his criminal conduct for the damage or injury that he sustained. (7) The defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present crime. (8) The criminal conduct of the defendant was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur. (9) The character and attitudes of the defendant indicate that he is unlikely to commit another crime. (10) The defendant is particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probationary treatment. (11) The confinement of the defendant would entail excessive hardship to him or his dependents.

(a) Method of payment.-- The treasurer of each county shall allow the use of credit cards, debit cards and bank cards in the payment of court costs, restitution and fines and may provide for automatic periodic deductions from a bank account, subject to the agreement of the owner of the account. (a.1) Wage attachment.-- A court may, at sentencing, assign an amount not greater than 25% of the defendant's gross salary, wages or other earnings to be used for the payment of court costs, restitution or fines. (b) Procedures regarding default.-- (1) If a defendant defaults in the payment of court costs, restitution or fines after imposition of sentence, the issuing authority or a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge appointed by the president judge for the purposes of this section may conduct a hearing to determine whether the defendant is financially able to pay. (2) If the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge determines that the defendant is financially able to pay the costs, restitution or fine, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may enter an order for wage attachment, turn the delinquent account over to a private collection agency or impose imprisonment for nonpayment, as provided by law. (2.1) (i) If the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge schedules a financial determination hearing for the defendant and provides notice to the defendant of the hearing, but the defendant fails to appear at the financial determination hearing, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may turn the delinquent account over to a private collection agency or the county's collection enforcement unit as set forth under section 9728 (relating to collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties), as provided by law. (ii) In each communication with the defendant, the private collection agency or the county's collection enforcement unit shall notify the defendant of the defendant's right to request a new financial determination hearing under paragraph (2.2). (2.2) (i) If the defendant has a delinquent account turned over to a private collection agency or the county's collection enforcement unit under paragraph (2.1), the defendant may request a new financial determination hearing on the defendant's financial ability to pay the court costs, restitution or fines. (ii) Upon receipt of the request for a new financial determination hearing under this paragraph, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge shall schedule and conduct the hearing in accordance with this subsection. (iii) Upon notice that the defendant has requested a new financial determination hearing under this paragraph, the private collection agency or the county's collection enforcement unit shall cease all collections activities pending the conclusion of the financial determination hearing. (iv) If the defendant fails to appear at the financial determination hearing under this paragraph, the private collection agency or county's collection enforcement unit may resume collection activities. (v) If the defendant requests a new financial determination hearing after failing to appear at a hearing previously requested under this paragraph, the private collection agency or county collection enforcement unit's collection activities may continue unless stayed by court order. (3) (i) If the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge determines that the defendant is without the financial means to pay the costs, restitution or fines immediately or in a single remittance, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may provide for payment in installments or, in the case of costs or fines, reduce or waive the costs or fines, except costs imposed under section 1101 of the act of November 24, 1998 (P.L.882, No.111), known as the Crime Victims Act. In determining the appropriate installments, reduction or waiver, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge shall consider the defendant's financial resources, the defendant's ability to make restitution and reparations and the nature of the burden the payment will impose on the defendant. (ii) If the defendant is in default of a payment or advises the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge that default is imminent, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may schedule a rehearing on the payment schedule. At the rehearing the defendant has the burden of proving changes of financial condition such that the defendant is without the means to meet the payment schedule. The issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge may extend or accelerate the schedule, leave it unaltered, reduce or waive the costs or fines, except costs imposed under section 1101 of the Crime Victims Act, or sentence the defendant to a period of community service as the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge finds to be just and practicable under the circumstances. (iii) If the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge determines that the defendant is without the financial means to pay the costs, restitution or fines under this paragraph, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge shall waive an existing collection fee under section 9730.1(b) (relating to collection of court costs, restitution and fines by private collection agency) that was not previously collected from the defendant who is determined to be without the financial means to pay the costs, restitution or fines under this paragraph. (4) A decision of the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge under paragraph (2), (2.1) or (3) is subject to section 5105 (relating to right to appellate review).

(b) Minimum sentence.-- (1) The court shall impose a minimum sentence of confinement which shall not exceed one-half of the maximum sentence imposed. (2) The minimum sentence imposed under this section may not be reduced through parole prior to the expiration of the minimum sentence unless otherwise authorized by this section or other law.

For maximum sentences of less than two years as defined under section 9762(f) (relating to sentencing proceeding; place of confinement), a court may parole a defendant prior to the expiration of the minimum sentence only if the defendant was made eligible to participate in a reentry plan at the time of sentencing. The court shall provide at least ten days' written notice and an opportunity to be heard, pursuant to section 9776 (relating to judicial power to release inmates), to the prosecuting attorney before granting parole pursuant to this subsection. The reentry plan eligibility shall be considered a part of the sentence and subject to the requirements relating to the entry, recording and reporting of sentences.

(c) Prohibition of parole for summary offenses.-- The court may impose a sentence to imprisonment without the right to parole under this subsection only when: (1) a summary offense is charged; (2) sentence is imposed for nonpayment of fines or costs, or both, in which case the sentence shall specify the number of days to be served; and (3) the maximum term or terms of imprisonment imposed on one or more indictments to run consecutively or concurrently total less than 30 days. (c.1) Sentence of total confinement combined with probation.-- The court may impose a sentence of imprisonment without parole under this subsection only when: (1) the period of total confinement is followed immediately by restrictive conditions of probation imposed pursuant to section 9763(c) or (d) (relating to conditions of probation) in which case the sentence of total confinement shall specify the number of days of total confinement also to be served; and (2) the maximum sentence of total confinement imposed on one or more indictments to run consecutively or concurrently total 90 days or less.

      "text": "§ 9771. Modification or revocation of order of probation. (a) General rule.-- The court has inherent power to at any time terminate continued supervision, lessen the conditions upon which an order of probation has been imposed or increase the conditions under which an order of probation has been imposed upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that a person presents an identifiable threat to public safety. (b) Revocation.-- The court may increase the conditions, impose a brief sanction under section 9771.1 (relating to court-imposed sanctions for violating probation) or revoke an order of probation upon proof of the violation of specified conditions of the probation. Subject to the limitations of subsections (b.1) and (c), upon revocation the sentencing alternatives available to the court shall be the same as were available at the time of initial sentencing, due consideration being given to the time spent serving the order of probation. The attorney for the Commonwealth may file notice at any time prior to resentencing of the Commonwealth's intention to proceed under an applicable provision of law requiring a mandatory minimum sentence. (b.1) Nonpayment of fines or costs.-- Notwithstanding subsection (b), the court may not extend the period of probation, may not impose a brief sanction under section 9771.1 and may not revoke an order of probation solely due to nonpayment of fines or costs unless the court finds, with respect to the payment of fines, the defendant is financially able to pay the fines and has willfully refused to do so. (c) Limitation on sentence of total confinement.-- There is a presumption against total confinement for technical violations of probation. The following shall apply: (1) The court may impose a sentence of total confinement upon revocation only if: (i) the defendant has been convicted of another crime; (ii) the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant committed a technical violation that involves an identifiable threat to public safety and the defendant cannot be safely diverted from total confinement through less restrictive means; or (iii) the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed a technical violation and any of the following apply: (A) The technical violation was sexual in nature. (B) The technical violation involved assaultive behavior or included a credible threat to cause bodily injury to another, including acts committed against a family or household member. (C) The technical violation involved possession or control of a firearm or dangerous weapon. (D) The technical violation involved the manufacture, sale, delivery or possession with the intent to manufacture, sell or deliver, a controlled substance or other drug regulated under the act of April 14, 1972 (P.L.233, No.64), known as The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act. (E) The defendant absconded and cannot be safely diverted from total confinement through less restrictive means. (F) The technical violation involved an intentional and unexcused failure to adhere to recommended programming or conditions on three or more separate occasions and the defendant cannot be safely diverted from total confinement through less restrictive means. For purposes of this clause, multiple technical violations stemming from the same episode of events shall not constitute separate technical violations. (2) If a court imposes a sentence of total confinement following a revocation, the basis of which is for one or more technical violations under paragraph (1)(ii) or (iii), the court shall consider the employment status of the defendant. The defendant shall be sentenced as follows: (i) For a first technical violation, a maximum period of 14 days. (ii) For a second technical violation, a maximum period of 30 days. (iii) For a third or subsequent technical violation, the court may impose any sentencing alternatives available at the time of initial sentencing. (iv) The time limitations contained in this paragraph shall not apply to the extent that a reasonable term of additional total confinement, not to exceed 30 days, is necessary to allow a defendant to either be evaluated for or to participate in: (A) a court-ordered drug, alcohol or mental health treatment program; or (B) a problem-solving court provided for in section 916 (relating to problem-solving courts). (3) Nothing in this section shall prevent the adoption of a program under section 9771.1. (d) Hearing required.-- There shall be no revocation or increase of conditions of sentence under this section except after a hearing at which the court shall consider the record of the sentencing proceeding together with evidence of the conduct of the defendant while on probation. Probation may be eliminated or the term decreased without a hearing. (Dec. 18, 2019, P.L.776, No.115, eff. imd.; Dec. 14, 2023, P.L.381, No.44, eff. 180 days) 2023 Amendment. Act 44 amended subsecs. (a), (b) and (c) and added subsec. (b.1). Section 6 of Act 44 provided that nothing in Act 44 shall be construed to prevent a defendant from petitioning a court for early termination of probation or modification of the terms and conditions of probation as otherwise permitted by law. See sections 5 and 7 of Act 44 in the appendix to this title for special provisions relating to applicability. Cross References.

(a) General rule.-- Except as otherwise provided under this chapter or if the Pennsylvania Parole Board has exclusive parole jurisdiction, a court of this Commonwealth or other court of record having jurisdiction may, after due hearing, release on parole an inmate in the county correctional institution of that judicial district. (b) Petition required.-- No inmate may be paroled under this section except on petition verified by the oath of the inmate or by the inmate's representative and presented and filed in the court in which the inmate was convicted. (c) Hearing.-- On presentation of the petition, the court shall fix a day for the hearing. A copy of the petition shall be served on the district attorney and prosecutor in the case at least ten days before the day fixed for the hearing. Proof of service on the district attorney and the prosecutor shall be produced at the hearing. (d) Order.-- After the hearing, the court shall make such order as it may deem just and proper. In case the court paroles the inmate, it shall place the inmate in the charge of and under the supervision of a designated probation officer. (e) Recommit.-- The court may, on cause shown by the probation officer that the inmate has violated his parole, recommit and reparole the inmate in the same manner and by the same procedure as in the case of the original parole if, in the judgment of the court, there is a reasonable probability that the inmate will benefit by being paroled. The court may also recommit for violation of that parole. (f) Limitation.-- (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), the power of a court to parole an inmate under this section shall extend for a period not to exceed the maximum sentence provided by law for the offense of which the inmate was convicted.

(a) Inmates committed to custody of department.-- If an inmate is committed to the custody of the department, the department, the inmate or a person to whom the court grants standing to act on behalf of the inmate may petition the sentencing court to temporarily defer service of the sentence of confinement and temporarily remove the inmate committed to the custody of the department, or other facility, for placement in a hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location. The following shall apply: (1) The sentencing court may approve the petitioner's request to temporarily defer service of the sentence of confinement and place the inmate in a hospital or long-term care nursing facility under electronic monitoring by the department upon clear and convincing proof that all of the following apply: (i) The medical needs of the inmate can be more appropriately addressed in the hospital or long-term care nursing facility. (ii) The hospital or long-term care nursing facility requested by the petitioner has agreed to accept the placement of the inmate and to provide necessary medical care. (iii) The inmate is seriously ill and is expected by a treating physician to not live for more than one year. (iv) There are no writs filed or detainers lodged against the inmate and the inmate is not subject to any court order requiring the inmate's presence. (v) The placement in the hospital or long-term care nursing facility does not pose an undue risk of escape or danger to the community. In making this determination, the sentencing court shall consider the inmate's institutional conduct record, whether the inmate was ever convicted of a crime of violence, the length of time that the inmate has been imprisoned and any other factors the sentencing court deems relevant. (vi) The hospital or long-term care nursing facility has agreed to notify the department and the court of any material changes in the health status of the inmate, the nature of the care provided or other information required by the department. (vii) Each agency representing the Commonwealth at a proceeding which resulted in an order committing or detaining the inmate, the State or local correctional facility housing the inmate and any registered crime victim have been given notice and an opportunity to be heard on the petition. (2) The sentencing court may approve the petitioner's request to temporarily defer service of the sentence of confinement in order for the inmate to receive care from a licensed hospice care provider, proposed by the petitioner and subject to electronic monitoring by the department, if all of the following are established by clear and convincing proof: (i) The inmate is terminally ill, not ambulatory and likely to die in the near future. (ii) The licensed hospice care provider can provide the inmate with more appropriate care. (iii) Appropriate medical care and palliative and supportive services will be provided by the licensed hospice care provider at the proposed hospice care location. (iv) The placement of the inmate in the proposed, licensed hospice care location does not pose an undue risk of escape or danger to the community. In making this determination, the sentencing court shall consider the inmate's institutional conduct record, whether the inmate was ever convicted of a crime of violence, the length of time that the inmate has been imprisoned and any other factors the sentencing court deems relevant. (v) The licensed hospice care provider has agreed to notify the department and the sentencing court of any material changes in the health status of the inmate, the nature of the hospice care provided or other information required by the department or the sentencing court. (vi) Each agency representing the Commonwealth at a proceeding which resulted in an order committing or detaining the inmate, the State or local correctional facility housing the inmate and any registered crime victim have been given notice and an opportunity to be heard on the petition. (3) Any order entered pursuant to this subsection temporarily deferring service of an inmate's sentence of confinement shall include a provision that the department or prosecuting attorney may at any time petition the sentencing court for an order directing that the inmate be recommitted to the custody of the department if the circumstances under which the inmate was released change or for any previously unknown circumstances, including a change in the inmate's medical status, the inmate's risk of escape, the inmate's danger to the community or the nature of the medical or other care provided by the hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care provider. (4) The sentencing court may terminate at any time its order authorizing the temporary deferral of the service of an inmate's sentence of confinement entered pursuant to this subsection. An inmate taken into custody pursuant to an order directing the inmate's detention or recommitment under this subsection shall be delivered to the nearest State correctional institution pending a hearing on the matter. (b) Inmates committed to custody of other facilities.-- An inmate not committed to the custody of the department but confined in an institution authorized to incarcerate or detain persons for criminal sentences, violations of criminal law or orders of parole, probation, bail or other order related to a civil or criminal matter may have service of the sentence of confinement deferred and may be placed in a hospital, long-term care nursing facility or licensed hospice care location, subject to electronic monitoring, by order of the judge that committed the inmate to the facility or institution or by another available judge designated to preside if all of the following are established by clear and convincing proof: (1) The chief administrator, the chief administrator's designee, the inmate or a person to whom the court grants standing to act on behalf of the inmate petitions the court or has given written consent to the grant of a petition under this section filed on behalf of the inmate. (2) There is sufficient proof to establish the requirements for a placement to a hospital or long-term care nursing facility under subsection (a)(1) or a placement to a hospice care location under subsection (a)(2). (3) An entry of an order pursuant to this subsection temporarily deferring service of an inmate's sentence of confinement shall include a provision that the chief administrator or the prosecuting attorney may at any time petition the sentencing court seeking the issuance of a bench warrant directing that the inmate be recommitted to the custody of the appropriate correctional institution if the circumstances under which the inmate was released change or for previously unknown circumstances, including a change in the inmate's medical status, the inmate's risk of escape, the inmate's danger to the community or the nature of the medical or other care provided by the hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care provider. (4) The sentencing court may terminate at any time its order authorizing the temporary deferral of the service of an inmate's sentence of confinement entered pursuant to this subsection. An inmate taken into custody pursuant to an order directing detention or recommitment under this subsection shall be delivered to the county correctional institution or other institution at which the inmate was confined prior to the entry of the order deferring the service of the sentence of confinement pending a hearing on the matter. (c) Service.-- Any petition filed under this section shall be served on each agency representing the Commonwealth at each proceeding which resulted in an order by which the inmate is committed or detained and to the correctional institution or institution responsible for housing the inmate. Each party shall have an opportunity to object and be heard as to the petition for alternative placement, the circumstances of placement, the conditions of return or any other relevant issue. The court shall ensure that any crime victim entitled to notification under section 201(7) or (8) of the act of November 24, 1998 (P.L.882, No.111), known as the Crime Victims Act, has been given notice and the opportunity to be heard on the petition. All parties served or notified under this subsection shall receive a copy of the final order adjudicating the petition. (d) Notice.-- (1) Any order entered under this section placing an inmate in a hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location which provides care to persons who were not placed therein pursuant to an order entered under this section shall direct the individual in charge of the hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location to ensure that each person receiving care at, and each employee or contractor working in, the hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location is notified that the placement was ordered if it is foreseeable that the person, employee or contractor will come into contact with the inmate during the placement. (2) The sentencing court shall forward notice of any order entered under this section placing an inmate in a hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location to the hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location and to the Department of Human Services. (e) Petition requirements.-- Any petition filed pursuant to this section must aver: (1) The name of the hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location proposed for placement. (2) That the petitioner reasonably believes the named hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location has agreed to accept the placement of the inmate and the facts upon which that belief is based. (f) Removal from placement.-- If an inmate placed in a hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location pursuant to this chapter removes himself from the hospital, long-term care nursing facility or hospice care location, the inmate shall be subject to arrest upon probable cause and shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of criminal contempt.

(a) Legislative findings.-- It is hereby determined and declared as a matter of legislative finding: (1) If the public is provided adequate notice and information about sexually violent predators and offenders as well as those sexually violent predators and offenders who do not have a fixed place of habitation or abode, the community can develop constructive plans to prepare itself for the release of sexually violent predators and offenders. This allows communities to meet with law enforcement to prepare and obtain information about the rights and responsibilities of the community and to provide education and counseling to their children. (2) These sexually violent predators and offenders pose a high risk of engaging in further offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitments, and protection of the public from this type of offender is a paramount governmental interest. (3) The penal and mental health components of our justice system are largely hidden from public view, and lack of information from either may result in failure of both systems to meet this paramount concern of public safety. (4) Overly restrictive confidentiality and liability laws governing the release of information about sexually violent predators and offenders have reduced the willingness to release information that could be appropriately released under the public disclosure laws and have increased risks to public safety. (5) Persons found to have committed a sexual offense have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public's interest in public safety and in the effective operation of government. (6) Release of information about sexually violent predators and offenders to public agencies and the general public will further the governmental interests of public safety and public scrutiny of the criminal and mental health systems so long as the information released is rationally related to the furtherance of those goals. (b) Declaration of policy.-- It is hereby declared to be the intention of the General Assembly to: (1) Protect the safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing for registration, community notification and access to information regarding sexually violent predators and offenders who are about to be released from custody and will live in or near their neighborhood. (2) Require the exchange of relevant information about sexually violent predators and offenders among public agencies and officials and to authorize the release of necessary and relevant information about sexually violent predators and offenders to members of the general public, including information available through the publicly accessible Internet website of the Pennsylvania State Police, as a means of assuring public protection and shall not be construed as punitive. (3) Address the Superior Court's opinion in the case of Commonwealth v. Wilgus, 975 A.2d 1183 (2009), by requiring sexually violent predators and offenders without a fixed place of habitation or abode to register under this subchapter. (4) Address the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Muniz, No. 47 MAP 2016 (Pa. 2016), and the Pennsylvania Superior Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Butler, 173 A.3d 1212 (Pa. Super. 2017). (June 12, 2018, P.L.140, No.29, eff. imd.) 2018 Amendment. Act 29 reenacted section 9799.51. References in Text. The citation, Commonwealth v.

      "text": "§ 9912. Supervisory relationship to offenders. (a) General rule.-- Officers are in a supervisory relationship with their offenders. The purpose of this supervision is to assist the offenders in their rehabilitation and reassimilation into the community and to protect the public. (b) Searches and seizures authorized.-- (1) Officers and, where they are responsible for the supervision of county offenders, State parole agents may search the person and property of offenders in accordance with the provisions of this section. (2) (i) Officers may search, in accordance with the provisions of this section, the person and property of any offender who accepts ARD as a result of a charge of a violation of 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 31 (relating to sexual offenses) if the court has determined that the offender shall be subject to personal and property searches as a condition of the offender's participation in the ARD program. (ii) The court shall notify each offender so offered ARD, prior to admission to an ARD program, that the offender shall be subject to searches in accordance with this section. (iii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit searches or seizures in violation of the Constitution of the United States or section 8 of Article I of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. (c) Effect of violation.-- No violation of this section shall constitute an independent ground for suppression of evidence in any probation and parole or criminal proceeding. (d) Grounds for personal search.-- (1) A personal search of an offender may be conducted by an officer: (i) if there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that the offender possesses contraband or other evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision; (ii) when an offender is transported or taken into custody; or (iii) upon an offender entering or leaving the securing enclosure of a correctional institution, jail or detention facility. (2) A property search may be conducted by an officer if there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the real or other property in the possession of or under the control of the offender contains contraband or other evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision. (3) Prior approval of a supervisor shall be obtained for a property search absent exigent circumstances. No prior approval shall be required for a personal search. (4) A written report of every property search conducted without prior approval shall be prepared by the officer who conducted the search and filed in the offender's case record. The exigent circumstances shall be stated in the report. (5) The offender may be detained if he is present during a property search. If the offender is not present during a property search, the officer in charge of the search shall make a reasonable effort to provide the offender with notice of the search, including a list of the items seized, after the search is completed. (6) The existence of reasonable suspicion to search shall be determined in accordance with constitutional search and seizure provisions as applied by judicial decision. In accordance with such case law, the following factors, where applicable, may be taken into account: (i) The observations of officers. (ii) Information provided by others. (iii) The activities of the offender. (iv) Information provided by the offender. (v) The experience of the officers with the offender. (vi) The experience of officers in similar circumstances. (vii) The prior criminal and supervisory history of the offender. (viii) The need to verify compliance with the conditions of supervision. (e) Nonresident offenders.-- No officer shall conduct a personal or property search of an offender who is residing in a foreign state except for the limited purposes permitted under the Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers. The offender is held accountable to the rules of both the sending state and the receiving state. Any personal or property search of an offender residing in another state shall be conducted by an officer of the receiving state. (e.1) Status of seized items.-- (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article XIII.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code, to the contrary, all contraband that is seized from an offender shall be considered abandoned and unclaimed, and no property right may exist in it, except as otherwise provided in this section, if the following criteria have been met: (i) The parolee or probationer from whom the item was seized is no longer under the jurisdiction of the court. (ii) Two years have elapsed from the date the parolee or probationer was no longer under the jurisdiction of the court under subparagraph (i). (iii) Notice that the item will be declared abandoned was mailed to the last known address of the parolee or probationer from whom the item was seized at least 60 days prior to the date the item is to be declared abandoned. (iv) No other claimant of the item has notified the county adult probation and parole department of his claim or is known to the county adult probation and parole department. (v) The item has not been forfeited in accordance with any forfeiture statute, including, but not limited to, Chapter 68 (relating to forfeitures) and as permitted by Pennsylvania common law. (2) Contraband seized under this section may not be subject to replevin, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the county adult probation and parole department. The county adult probation and parole department shall tag and secure the contraband at a place designated by it for such time as is necessary to secure its use as evidence in a violation, revocation or criminal proceeding. In no event may the county adult probation and parole department retain the property for a period of less than 180 days after the hearing conducted under paragraph (3). (3) (i) No later than the time of the first-level hearing to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that a violation of probation, parole or intermediate punishment has been committed, the county adult probation and parole department shall provide notice to the offender that abandonment will be sought if the offender does not claim the seized contraband within two years after sentence completion. (ii) If the hearing is waived or there is a new criminal charge arising from the incident that included the seizure of the contraband, then notice under this paragraph shall be given at least five days before an abandonment hearing is held and the hearing shall be scheduled by the county adult probation and parole department within a reasonable time. (4) If it has been determined that property is contraband that shall be declared abandoned, the contraband shall be retained by the county adult probation and parole department until all appeal periods are exhausted to provide an opportunity for any additional parties to assert a claim of ownership or lienhold interest in the contraband. If the county adult probation and parole department receives notice of such a claim, the claimant or claimants shall be provided a hearing pursuant to paragraph (3). (5) (i) Whenever contraband is declared abandoned under this subchapter, the contraband shall be transferred to the custodial care of the county adult probation and parole department. After the expiration of the necessary time period specified in this section, the county adult probation and parole department shall itemize all such abandoned contraband within its custodial care in a report to the Treasury Department. (ii) Within 10 business days following receipt of an itemized contraband report from a county adult probation and parole department, the Treasury Department shall provide an itemized list of all such abandoned contraband that it will not accept into its custodial care. (iii) All abandoned contraband not accepted by the Treasury Department pursuant to this section shall remain under the custodial control of the county adult probation and parole department. Abandoned contraband not otherwise refused by the Treasury Department shall be transferred to the custodial control of the Treasury Department as directed by the Treasury Department. (6) All abandoned contraband refused by the Treasury Department and remaining under the custodial control of the county adult probation and parole department shall be deemed property of the county department and title to the property shall transfer. Thereafter, the county probation and parole department shall be entitled to any or all of the following: (i) Retain the contraband for official use. (ii) Destroy the contraband. (iii) Donate the contraband to a nonprofit organization or governmental entity. (iv) Sell any contraband that is not required to be destroyed by law. (v) If the item is of de minimis value, as determined by the county adult probation and parole department, dispose of the item, without sale. (7) The county treasurer of each county shall establish and administer a community correction forfeiture fund consisting of all cash or proceeds obtained under this section. The county treasurer shall disburse money from this fund only at the discretion of the president judge of the court of common pleas, subject to paragraph (8). (8) Cash or proceeds generated by the sale of any abandoned contraband shall first be made available to satisfy any restitution owed by the offender to crime victims who are known at the time of the seizure by the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency's Office of Victim Services or by the courts of the Commonwealth where the offender was sentenced. (9) The county adult probation and parole department and its employees shall be immune from liability for good faith conduct under this section. (10) The Department of Corrections may enact regulations that are necessary to implement this subsection on a uniform basis throughout this Commonwealth. If regulations are promulgated, a county adult probation and parole department must comply with the regulations. (11) The provisions set forth in this subsection shall apply to all contraband seized after the effective date of this subsection. (12) Contraband seized prior to the effective date of this subsection may be disposed of in the manner set forth in paragraph (5) after notice is given to the offender from whom it was seized and any claimant known to the county adult probation and parole department. The county adult probation and parole department shall provide the notice within a reasonable time prior to holding a hearing at which abandonment shall be determined. (13) (i) An appeal of an abandonment determination may be made by filing an appeal with the court of common pleas. The appeal must be received by the court of common pleas within 30 days of the mailing date of the county adult probation and parole department's order. (ii) When a timely appeal of an abandonment determination has been filed, the abandonment may not be deemed final for purpose of appeal to a court until the court has mailed its decision on the appeal. (iii) The scope of review of an appeal shall be limited to whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence, an error of law has been committed or there has been a violation of constitutional law. (iv) The failure of an appeal to present with accuracy, brevity, clearness and specificity whatever is essential to a ready and adequate understanding of the factual and legal points requiring consideration shall be a sufficient reason for denying the appeal. (v) A second or subsequent appeal and an appeal that is untimely filed under this paragraph shall not be received. (vi) The procedure for appeal contained in this subsection may not be construed to alter or replace any procedures provided by law for the timely filing of appeals to appellate courts. (14) The county adult probation and parole department shall annually post a report specifying the abandoned property or proceeds of the abandoned property obtained under this section on the county's publicly accessible Internet website and make the report available as a public document. The report shall give an accounting of all proceeds derived from the sale of abandoned property and the use made of unsold abandoned property. (f) When authority is effective.-- The authority granted to the officers under this section shall be effective upon enactment of this section, without the necessity of any further regulation by the board.
