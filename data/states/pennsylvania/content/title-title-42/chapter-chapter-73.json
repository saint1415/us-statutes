If the opposing party denies the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, the court shall proceed summarily to determine the issue so raised and shall order the parties to proceed with arbitration if it finds for the moving party.

If the court finds for the opposing party, the court shall order the parties to proceed with arbitration.\n\n(c) Venue.--If a controversy alleged to be or not to be referable to arbitration under the agreement is also involved in an action or proceeding pending in a court having jurisdiction to hear applications to compel or stay arbitration, the application shall be made to that court. Otherwise, subject to section 7319 (relating to venue of court proceedings), the application may be made in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(d) Stay of judicial proceedings.--An action or proceeding, allegedly involving an issue subject to arbitration, shall be stayed if a court order to proceed with arbitration has been made or an application for such an order has been made under this section.
