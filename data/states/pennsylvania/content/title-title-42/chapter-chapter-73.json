Absent a method prescribed in the agreement to arbitrate, the court shall choose new arbitrators in accordance with section 7305 (relating to appointment of arbitrators by court). If the award is vacated on grounds not affecting the competency of the arbitrators under subsection (a)(1)(i) through (iv), the court may order a rehearing before the arbitrators who made the award or their successors appointed in accordance with section 7305. The time period within which the agreement requires the original award to be made is applicable to the rehearing and commences from the date of the court order directing a rehearing.\n\n(d) Confirmation of award.--If an application to vacate the award is denied and no application to modify or correct the award is pending, the court shall confirm the award.\n\nCross References.Section 7314 is referred to in sections 7311, 7313 of this title.",
