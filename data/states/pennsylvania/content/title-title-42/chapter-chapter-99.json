No prior approval shall be required for a personal search.\n\n(4) A written report of every property search conducted without prior approval shall be prepared by the officer who conducted the search and filed in the offender's case record. The exigent circumstances shall be stated in the report.\n\n(5) The offender may be detained if he is present during a property search. If the offender is not present during a property search, the officer in charge of the search shall make a reasonable effort to provide the offender with notice of the search, including a list of the items seized, after the search is completed.\n\n(6) The existence of reasonable suspicion to search shall be determined in accordance with constitutional search and seizure provisions as applied by judicial decision. In accordance with such case law, the following factors, where applicable, may be taken into account:\n\n(i) The observations of officers.\n\n(ii) Information provided by others.\n\n(iii) The activities of the offender.\n\n(iv) Information provided by the offender.\n\n(v) The experience of the officers with the offender.\n\n(vi) The experience of officers in similar circumstances.\n\n(vii) The prior criminal and supervisory history of the offender.\n\n(viii) The need to verify compliance with the conditions of supervision.\n\n(e) Nonresident offenders.--No officer shall conduct a personal or property search of an offender who is residing in a foreign state except for the limited purposes permitted under the Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers.

The county adult probation and parole department shall tag and secure the contraband at a place designated by it for such time as is necessary to secure its use as evidence in a violation, revocation or criminal proceeding. In no event may the county adult probation and parole department retain the property for a period of less than 180 days after the hearing conducted under paragraph (3).\n\n(3) (i) No later than the time of the first-level hearing to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that a violation of probation, parole or intermediate punishment has been committed, the county adult probation and parole department shall provide notice to the offender that abandonment will be sought if the offender does not claim the seized contraband within two years after sentence completion.\n\n(ii) If the hearing is waived or there is a new criminal charge arising from the incident that included the seizure of the contraband, then notice under this paragraph shall be given at least five days before an abandonment hearing is held and the hearing shall be scheduled by the county adult probation and parole department within a reasonable time.\n\n(4) If it has been determined that property is contraband that shall be declared abandoned, the contraband shall be retained by the county adult probation and parole department until all appeal periods are exhausted to provide an opportunity for any additional parties to assert a claim of ownership or lienhold interest in the contraband. If the county adult probation and parole department receives notice of such a claim, the claimant or claimants shall be provided a hearing pursuant to paragraph (3).\n\n(5) (i) Whenever contraband is declared abandoned under this subchapter, the contraband shall be transferred to the custodial care of the county adult probation and parole department.

The county adult probation and parole department shall provide the notice within a reasonable time prior to holding a hearing at which abandonment shall be determined.\n\n(13) (i) An appeal of an abandonment determination may be made by filing an appeal with the court of common pleas. The appeal must be received by the court of common pleas within 30 days of the mailing date of the county adult probation and parole department's order.\n\n(ii) When a timely appeal of an abandonment determination has been filed, the abandonment may not be deemed final for purpose of appeal to a court until the court has mailed its decision on the appeal.\n\n(iii) The scope of review of an appeal shall be limited to whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence, an error of law has been committed or there has been a violation of constitutional law.\n\n(iv) The failure of an appeal to present with accuracy, brevity, clearness and specificity whatever is essential to a ready and adequate understanding of the factual and legal points requiring consideration shall be a sufficient reason for denying the appeal.\n\n(v) A second or subsequent appeal and an appeal that is untimely filed under this paragraph shall not be received.\n\n(vi) The procedure for appeal contained in this subsection may not be construed to alter or replace any procedures provided by law for the timely filing of appeals to appellate courts.\n\n(14) The county adult probation and parole department shall annually post a report specifying the abandoned property or proceeds of the abandoned property obtained under this section on the county's publicly accessible Internet website and make the report available as a public document.
