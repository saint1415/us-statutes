The General Assembly hereby finds and declares as follows: (1) The health, safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth are directly dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within this Commonwealth. (2) Unemployment, the spread of indigency and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. (3) Development and continuation of a major convention center is most appropriate in a city of the first class which, because of size, is capable of attracting major national conventions, and the attraction of business to this Commonwealth as a result of the development and continuation is an important factor in the continual encouragement, promotion, attraction, stimulation, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within a city of the first class, its surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (4) The purpose of a convention center should be the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in a city of the first class, its surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (5) The development and continuation of a convention center will provide benefits to the hotel industry throughout the entire region where the convention center is developed. (6) The development and continuation of a convention center will also provide benefits to the restaurant and entertainment industries throughout the entire region where the convention center is located, to all other businesses and individuals benefited by the attraction of major conventions and tourists, to other individual businesses whose livelihood is dependent on the attraction of major conventions and tourists and to the general public. (7) The need for and promotion of the type of facility which provides and will continue to provide significant benefits to the general public will require the expenditure of public money, and it is appropriate to authorize a city of the first class where the convention center is located to impose and collect a tax or continue to impose and collect a tax, applicable within the entire territorial limits of the city, to facilitate the development or continuation of a convention center and the promotion of tourism within the city of the first class and the region. (8) To promote the development and continuation of a convention center within this Commonwealth, it is necessary to provide additional and flexible means of developing, constructing, designing, managing, financing and operating such a convention center. (9) An important aspect of the development and continuation of a convention center should be the removal of blighted areas and the redevelopment of blighted areas. (10) The policy of this Commonwealth is to promote the health, safety, employment, business opportunities and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing for the creation and continuation of a convention center authority, which shall exist and operate as a public instrumentality of this Commonwealth for the public purpose of promoting, attracting, stimulating, developing and expanding business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. This purpose is declared to be a public purpose supporting the enactment of all provisions of this chapter and for which public money may be spent, taxes may be imposed and continued and private property may be acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain.",

(a) Application for continued service.-- At any time before or after service is terminated by a public utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer, the affected tenants may apply to the utility to have service continued or resumed. (b) Payment of charges by tenants.-- A public utility shall not terminate service or shall promptly resume service previously terminated if it receives from the tenants an amount equal to the bill for the affected account of the landlord ratepayer for the billing month preceding the notice to the tenants. Thereafter, the utility shall notify each tenant of the total amount of the bill for the second and each succeeding billing month and, if the tenants fail to make payment of any bill within 30 days of the delivery of the notice to the tenants, the utility may commence termination of service, except that no termination may occur until 30 days after each tenant has been furnished notice of the proposed termination as prescribed in section 1528 (relating to delivery and contents of subsequent termination notice to tenants). The tenant or tenants shall make payment to the utility on account of nonpayment of charges by the landlord ratepayer by check or money order drawn by the tenant to the order of the utility or by cash. In all cases, the tenant shall provide, upon request, reasonable identification to the utility. For the purposes of this section, \"reasonable identification\" shall include, but not be limited to, a driver's license, photo identification, medical assistance or food stamp identification or any similar document issued by any public agency which contains the name and address of the tenant. (c) Disposition of payment by utility.-- Upon receiving any payment, the utility shall notify the landlord ratepayer who is liable for the utility service of the amount or amounts paid by any tenant and the amount or amounts credited to the landlord's bill for each tenant pursuant to this section. Tenants requesting continued utility service under this section, except those individually subscribing for service under subsection (d), shall not be considered utility customers but shall be considered to be acting on behalf of the landlord ratepayer, who shall remain liable to the utility for service provided after notice to tenants. In the event that the tenants fail to satisfy the requirements of subsection (b) with regard to the first billing month period preceding notice to the tenant, the utility shall refund any moneys received from a tenant to that tenant. Any payments made by the tenants shall be applied first against the bill for the billing month preceding notice to the tenants and then against bills for service rendered subsequent to the bill. Upon termination of service to the tenants for failure to pay the utility bill for service in full for any subsequent month or upon voluntary discontinuance of service at the request of the tenants, the utility shall immediately refund to the tenants any amounts paid to the utility for the billing period for which payment in full was not remitted. (d) Agreement for individual service.-- Any tenant of a residential building or mobile home park who has been notified of a proposed discontinuance of utility service pursuant to section 1523 (relating to notices before service to landlord discontinued) shall have the right to agree to subscribe for future service individually if this can be accomplished without a major revision of distribution facilities or additional right-of-way acquisitions.

The General Assembly hereby finds and declares as follows: (1) The health, safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth are directly dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within this Commonwealth. (2) Unemployment, the spread of indigency and the heavy burden of public assistance and unemployment compensation can be avoided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. (3) Development and continuation of a major convention center is most appropriate in a city of the first class which, because of size, is capable of attracting major national conventions, and the attraction of business to this Commonwealth as a result of the development and continuation is an important factor in the continual encouragement, promotion, attraction, stimulation, development, growth and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism within a city of the first class, its surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (4) The purpose of a convention center should be the promotion, attraction, stimulation, development and expansion of business, industry, commerce and tourism in a city of the first class, its surrounding counties and this Commonwealth as a whole. (5) The development and continuation of a convention center will provide benefits to the hotel industry throughout the entire region where the convention center is developed. (6) The development and continuation of a convention center will also provide benefits to the restaurant and entertainment industries throughout the entire region where the convention center is located, to all other businesses and individuals benefited by the attraction of major conventions and tourists, to other individual businesses whose livelihood is dependent on the attraction of major conventions and tourists and to the general public. (7) The need for and promotion of the type of facility which provides and will continue to provide significant benefits to the general public will require the expenditure of public money, and it is appropriate to authorize a city of the first class where the convention center is located to impose and collect a tax or continue to impose and collect a tax, applicable within the entire territorial limits of the city, to facilitate the development or continuation of a convention center and the promotion of tourism within the city of the first class and the region. (8) To promote the development and continuation of a convention center within this Commonwealth, it is necessary to provide additional and flexible means of developing, constructing, designing, managing, financing and operating such a convention center. (9) An important aspect of the development and continuation of a convention center should be the removal of blighted areas and the redevelopment of blighted areas. (10) The policy of this Commonwealth is to promote the health, safety, employment, business opportunities and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing for the creation and continuation of a convention center authority, which shall exist and operate as a public instrumentality of this Commonwealth for the public purpose of promoting, attracting, stimulating, developing and expanding business, industry, commerce and tourism in this Commonwealth. This purpose is declared to be a public purpose supporting the enactment of all provisions of this chapter and for which public money may be spent, taxes may be imposed and continued and private property may be acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain.",

No contract shall be entered into for construction or improvement or repair of any project or portion of a project unless the contractor shall provide sufficient surety or sureties approved by the authority, and in an amount fixed by the authority, for the performance of the contract. All contracts shall provide, among other things, that the person or corporation entering into the contract with the authority will pay for all materials furnished and services rendered for the performance of the contract and that any person or corporation furnishing materials or rendering services may maintain an action to recover for the same against the obligor in the undertaking as though the person or corporation was named in the undertaking, provided the action is brought within one year after the time the cause of action accrued. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the power of the authority to construct, repair or improve any project or portion of a project or any addition, betterment or extension to a project, directly by the officers and employees of the authority. Whether the costs of the project are being paid for in whole or in part with funds provided under section 6015 (relating to transfer of existing facilities or funds; making of annual grants and lease payments to authority; Commonwealth bonds), the authority may award the construction, expansion or substantial renovation of a convention center as a single bid project without regard to the provisions of the act of May 1, 1913 (P.L.155, No.104), entitled \"An act regulating the letting of certain contracts for the erection, construction, and alteration of public buildings,\" and shall not be subject to 62 Pa.C.S.

(b) Supplies and materials.-- All supplies and materials costing $25,000 or more to be acquired directly by the authority shall be purchased only after due advertisement as provided in this chapter. The authority shall accept the lowest bid or bids from a responsible bidder, kind, quality and material being equal, but the authority shall have the right to reject any or all bids or select a single item from any bid. The provisions as to bidding shall not apply to the purchase of unique supplies and materials or supplies and materials which cannot be obtained in the open market. (c) Management prerogatives.-- Nothing in this section or in any other law of the Commonwealth shall preclude the board, with the approval of eight members of the board, from negotiating contracts for management, operation, concession services, licensing or leasing of a convention center or any part of a convention center.
