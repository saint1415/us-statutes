The application period under this subsection shall be for a period of no less than 60 days and no longer than 120 days.\n\n(b) Form and contents.--An application for a grant under section 6123 shall be submitted to the authority and shall include information required by Federal law or guidance and any other information required by the authority. The authority shall develop an application form and post and make the application form available on the authority's publicly accessible Internet website.\n\n(c) Availability for review.--Within 10 business days after the expiration of the application period under subsection (a), the authority shall make the proposed unserved areas, underserved areas and the community anchor institutions available for review on the authority's publicly accessible Internet website.\n\n(d) Overbuild challenges.--Before awarding grant funds for the development and deployment of broadband networks under section 6123, the authority shall ensure a transparent, evidence-based and expeditious challenge process under which an entity eligible to be an applicant may challenge a proposed project on the grounds that awarding a grant under section 6123 to the applicant will result in an overbuild. After resolving each challenge under this subsection, and not later than 60 days before awarding grant funds for the development and deployment of broadband networks under section 6123, the authority shall provide public notice of the final classification of each unserved area, underserved area and community anchor institution within the Commonwealth. If an entity eligible to be an applicant submits a challenge under this subsection, the challenge shall be in writing and on a form developed by the authority and shall include all of the following information:\n\n(1) A declaration disputing the eligibility of the proposed project, including whether a particular location is in an unserved area or underserved area.\n\n(2) An affidavit from the broadband service provider of the provider's existing or planned provision of high-speed broadband service within the proposed project area.\n\n(e) Review.--In reviewing an application and any accompanying challenge under this section, the authority shall ensure that the grant award under section 6123 for the development and deployment of broadband networks is used to deploy high-speed broadband service to unserved or underserved areas as required by Federal law or guidance. The authority may not award a grant under section 6123 to fund deployment of high-speed broadband service for a project area that results in an overbuild.\n\n(f) Infrastructure criteria.--The board shall award grants under section 6123 for proposed high-speed broadband service infrastructure projects based upon a scoring system, which shall be released to the public at least 30 days before the beginning of the application period under subsection (a). The authority shall consider all of the following criteria when weighing or scoring an application for a grant under section 6123:\n\n(1) The size and scope of the unserved or underserved area to be deployed.\n\n(2) The experience, technical ability and financial capability of the applicant to successfully deploy high-speed broadband service infrastructure and provide high-speed broadband service.\n\n(3) The extent to which Federal, State or local government funding support is necessary to develop and deploy high-speed broadband service infrastructure in an economically feasible manner in the proposed project area.\n\n(4) The proportion of the capital pledged by the applicant to finance the proposed high-speed broadband service infrastructure project under subsection (b).\n\n(5) The high-speed broadband service speed thresholds proposed in the application and the scalability of the high-speed broadband service infrastructure proposed to be deployed to provide high-speed broadband service to households and businesses.\n\n(6) An affidavit that no grant funding shall be used in such a manner as to result in an overbuild.\n\n(7) An affidavit that an applicant shall ensure that a contractor or subcontractor performing construction, reconstruction, demolition, repair or maintenance work on a high-speed broadband service infrastructure project developed and deployed under this chapter meets all of the following requirements:\n\n(i) Maintains all valid licenses, registrations or certificates required by the Federal Government, the Commonwealth or a local government entity that are necessary to do business or perform applicable work.\n\n(ii) Maintains compliance with the act of June 2, 1915 (P.L.736, No.338), known as the Workers' Compensation Act, the act of December 5, 1936 (2nd Sp.Sess., 1937 P.L.2897, No.1), known as the Unemployment Compensation Law, and bonding and liability insurance requirements as specified in the contract for the project.\n\n(iii) Has not defaulted on a project, declared bankruptcy, been debarred or suspended on a project by the Federal Government, the Commonwealth or a local government entity within the previous three years.\n\n(iv) Has not been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony relating to the performance or operation of the business of the contractor or subcontractor within the previous 10 years.\n\n(v) Has completed a minimum of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration's 10-hour safety training course or similar training sufficient to prepare workers for any hazards that may be encountered during their work on the high-speed broadband service infrastructure.\n\n(8) Other factors which the authority determines to be reasonable and appropriate for the purposes of this chapter.\n\n(f.1) Other project criteria.--The board shall award grants under section 6123 for all other projects based upon a scoring system, which shall be released to the public at least 30 days before the beginning of the application period under subsection (a). The authority shall determine the criteria when weighing or scoring an application for a grant under section 6123 based on Federal law or guidance and other factors which the authority determines to be reasonable and appropriate for the purposes of this chapter.\n\n(g) Regulatory obligations.--In awarding grants under section 6123, the authority shall not consider any additional regulatory obligations, except as required under applicable Federal or State law.\n\n(h) Time for project completion.--Applicants shall deploy the broadband network and begin providing service to each customer that desires service not later than four years after the date in which the applicant receives a grant unless otherwise extended by the authority and allowed by Federal law or guidance. Grant funds awarded to an applicant who fails to complete a proposed project within four years, unless otherwise extended by the authority, may be subject to refund or clawback by the authority.\n\nCross References.Section 6124 is referred to in section 6102 of this title.",
