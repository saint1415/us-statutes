(7) Individual conditions and requirements for parole have been established. (8) Notice and opportunity to be heard was provided by the board to the sentencing court and the prosecuting attorney in a manner consistent with section 6137(g)(2) (relating to parole power).

(a) Convicted violators.-- (1) The board may, at its discretion, revoke the parole of a paroled offender if the offender, during the period of parole or while delinquent on parole, commits a crime punishable by imprisonment, for which the offender is convicted or found guilty by a judge or jury or to which the offender pleads guilty or nolo contendere at any time thereafter in a court of record. (1.1) In addition to paragraph (1), a parolee under the jurisdiction of the board released from a correctional facility who, during the period of parole or while delinquent on parole, commits a crime punishable by imprisonment for which the parolee is convicted or found guilty by a judge or jury or to which the parolee pleads guilty or nolo contendere or of any misdemeanor of the third degree or of any of the following offenses where graded as a summary offense, may at the discretion of the board be recommitted as a parole violator: (i) Possession of a firearm in a court facility under 18 Pa.C.S. § 913(b)(3) (relating to possession of firearm or other dangerous weapon in court facility).

(viii) Selling or furnishing nonalcoholic beverages to minors under 18 Pa.C.S. § 6310.7 (relating to selling or furnishing nonalcoholic beverages to persons under 21 years of age).

(2.1) The board may, in its discretion, award credit to an offender recommitted under paragraph (2) for the time spent at liberty on parole, unless any of the following apply: (i) The crime committed during the period of parole or while delinquent on parole is a crime of violence or a crime listed under 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 97 Subch. H (relating to registration of sexual offenders) or I (relating to continued registration of sexual offenders). (ii) The offender was recommitted under section 6143 (relating to early parole of offenders subject to Federal removal order).

(4) The period for which the offender is required to serve shall be computed by the board and shall begin on the date that the parole violator is taken into custody to be returned to the institution as an offender. (5) If a new sentence is imposed on the offender, the service of the balance of the term originally imposed by a Pennsylvania court shall precede the commencement of the new term imposed in the following cases: (i) If a person is paroled from a State correctional institution and the new sentence imposed on the person is to be served in the State correctional institution. (ii) If a person is paroled from a county prison and the new sentence imposed upon him is to be served in the same county prison. (iii) In all other cases, the service of the new term for the latter crime shall precede commencement of the balance of the term originally imposed. (5.1) If the offender is sentenced to serve a new term of total confinement by a Federal court or by a court of another jurisdiction because of a verdict or plea under paragraph (1), the offender shall serve the balance of the original term before serving the new term. (6) Any offender upon recommitment to a correctional facility shall be sent to the institution designated by the secretary or a designee. (i) (Deleted by amendment). (ii) (Deleted by amendment). (b) Subsequent arrest.-- (1) The formal filing of a charge after parole against an offender within this Commonwealth for any violation of the laws of this Commonwealth shall constitute an automatic detainer and permit the offender to be taken into and held in custody.

(3) The automatic detainer shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other detainer that prior to the effective date of this chapter may have been lodged in such circumstances. (c) Technical violators.-- (1) Subject to paragraph (1.3), an offender under the jurisdiction of the board who violates the terms and conditions of his parole, other than a convicted violator who has parole revoked under subsection (a), may be detained pending a hearing before the board or waiver of the hearing or recommitted after a hearing before the board or a waiver of the hearing. Detention and recommitment under this paragraph shall be in a community corrections center, community corrections facility or any secured facility operated or contracted by the department.

(1.2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) and subject to paragraph (1.3), an offender under the jurisdiction of the board who violates the terms and conditions of his parole, other than a convicted parole violator who has parole revoked under subsection (a), may be arrested and detained without revocation of parole under a program to impose swift, predictable and brief sanctions. The program shall provide for immediate detention in a community corrections center, community corrections facility or any secured facility operated or contracted by the department for a period not to exceed seven days. The board shall adopt procedures governing appropriate detention under this paragraph, including identifying which offenders are eligible for the program and providing warnings to offenders to clearly communicate expectations and consequences. (1.3) If the board determines that one of the following conditions is present regarding an offender who violates the terms and conditions of parole, the offender shall not be eligible for detention under paragraph (1.2) and shall be detained in or recommitted to a State correctional institution or contracted county jail: (i) The violation was sexual in nature. (ii) The violation involved assaultive behavior or included a credible threat to cause bodily injury to another. (iii) The violation involved possession or control of a weapon. (iv) The offender has absconded and the offender cannot be safely diverted to a community corrections center, community corrections facility or any secured facility operated or contracted by the department. (v) There exists an identifiable threat to public safety, and the offender cannot be safely diverted to a community corrections center, community corrections facility or any secured facility operated or contracted by the department. (vi) The violation involved an intentional and unexcused failure to adhere to recommended programming or conditions on more than three occasions, and the offender cannot be safely diverted to a community corrections center, community corrections facility or any secured facility operated or contracted by the department. (1.4) Every offender's placement in a community corrections center, community corrections facility or parole violator center shall be subject to a condition that the offender comply with the rules of conduct applicable to the place where the offender is housed. The department may, at its discretion, place an offender accused of violating the rules of conduct in a State correctional institution or contracted county jail, pending an investigation or disciplinary hearing, or serve a disciplinary sanction under the department's procedures, or both. (2) If the offender is recommitted under this subsection, the offender shall be given credit for the time served on parole in good standing but with no credit for delinquent time and may be reentered to serve the remainder of the original sentence or sentences. Credit awarded to a technical parole violator for time served on parole in good standing is subject to forfeiture if the offender is subsequently recommitted as a convicted parole violator. (3) The remainder shall be computed by the board from the time the offender's delinquent conduct occurred for the unexpired period of the maximum sentence imposed by the court without credit for the period the offender was delinquent on parole. The offender shall serve the remainder so computed from the date the offender is taken into custody by the department's agent. (4) Subject to subsection (e), the offender shall be subject to reparole by the board whenever in its opinion the best interests of the offender justify or require the offender being reparoled and it does not appear that the interests of the Commonwealth will be injured reparoling the offender. (5) Parole violators shall be supervised in accordance with evidence-based practices that may include: (i) Consideration of whether the offender poses a risk of safety to the community or himself. (ii) The department's capacity to deliver programs that address criminal thinking behavior and related crime-producing factors. (iii) Use of community-based sanctioning alternatives to incarceration. (iv) Use of a graduated violation sanctioning process.

Detention and recommitment under this paragraph shall be to the county correctional facility from which the offender was released. (d) Recommitment to correctional facility.-- A technical parole violator recommitted to a State correctional institution or a contracted county jail under subsection (c) shall be recommitted as follows: (1) If paroled from a county prison, to the same institution or to any other institution to which the offender may be legally transferred. (2) If paroled from a State correctional institution, to any State correctional institution, parole violator center or contracted county jail designated by the department. (3) Except as set forth in paragraph (4) or (5), the offender shall be recommitted for one of the following periods, at which time the offender shall automatically be reparoled without further action by the board: (i) For the first recommitment under this subsection, a maximum period of six months.

(b) Application for certificate of salvage.-- An owner who transfers a vehicle to be destroyed or dismantled, salvaged or recycled shall assign the certificate of title to the person to whom the vehicle is transferred. Except as provided in section 1163, the transferee shall immediately present the assigned certificate of title to the department or an authorized agent of the department with an application for a certificate of salvage upon a form furnished and prescribed by the department.

The person identified on the application must be located or the owner or lienholder must be domiciled in this Commonwealth to qualify for issuance of a certificate of salvage by the department.

The revenues of the authority and the real and tangible personal property of the authority shall be pledged or otherwise encumbered only as expressly provided in this section and, except to the extent necessary to effectuate such pledge or encumbrance, shall not be subject to attachment nor levied upon by execution or otherwise.",

(b) Nonresident.-- The nonresident owner of a motor vehicle not registered in this Commonwealth may give proof of financial responsibility by filing with the department a written certificate or certificates of an insurance company authorized to transact business in the state in which the motor vehicle or motor vehicles described in the certificate are registered or, if the nonresident does not own a motor vehicle, then evidence satisfactory to the department that the person does not own a motor vehicle. The department shall accept the certificate upon condition that the insurance company complies with the following provisions with respect to the policies so certified: (1) The insurance company shall execute a power of attorney authorizing the department to accept service on its behalf or process in any action arising out of a motor vehicle accident in this Commonwealth. (2) The insurance company shall agree in writing that the policies shall be deemed to conform with the laws of this Commonwealth relating to the terms of motor vehicle liability policies issued in this Commonwealth. (c) Default by foreign insurance company.-- If any insurance company not authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth, which has qualified to furnish proof of financial responsibility, defaults in any undertakings or agreements, the department shall not thereafter accept as proof any certificate of the company whether theretofore filed or thereafter tendered as proof as long as the default continues. (d) Financial responsibility identification cards.-- Insurers shall provide financial responsibility identification cards to insureds which shall be valid only for the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured. If the insured and insurer both agree, the insurer may issue the financial responsibility identification card solely in electronic format. Financial responsibility identification cards shall disclose the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured and shall contain such other information as required by the Insurance Department. In such instance where the insured has financed premiums through a premium finance company or where the insured is on an insurer-sponsored or agency-sponsored payment plan, financial responsibility identification cards may be issued for periods of six months even though such payment by the insured may be for a period of less than six months. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the immediate issuance of financial responsibility identification cards where an insured replaces an insured vehicle, adds a vehicle or increases coverages under an existing policy for which a premium adjustment is required. (e) Immunity.-- If an insured chooses to provide proof of financial responsibility to be viewed in an electronic format on an electronic device pursuant to section 1786 (relating to required financial responsibility), a police officer administering in good faith this subchapter shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability which arises from the insured's choice, including the inadvertent viewing of materials on the device other than the proof of financial responsibility, inadvertent deletion of information from the device, inadvertent interception of a communication while in possession of the device and breakage which occurs to the device.

(a) General rule.-- Every motor vehicle of the type required to be registered under this title which is operated or currently registered shall be covered by financial responsibility. (b) Self-certification.-- The Department of Transportation shall require that each motor vehicle registrant certify that the registrant is financially responsible at the time of registration or renewal thereof. The department shall refuse to register or renew the registration of a vehicle for failure to comply with this requirement or falsification of self-certification. (c) Consent to produce proof of financial responsibility.-- Upon registering a motor vehicle or renewing a motor vehicle registration, the owner of the motor vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to produce proof, upon request, to the Department of Transportation or a police officer that the vehicle registrant has the financial responsibility required by this chapter. Proof of financial responsibility may be satisfied under this chapter by production of a financial responsibility identification card in paper or electronic form. If an owner of a motor vehicle is providing electronic proof of financial responsibility to a police officer, the police officer shall only view content that is reasonably necessary to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility. The owner of the electronic device assumes liability for any damage to the electronic device containing the financial responsibility identification card while in possession of the police officer or agents of the department. (d) Suspension of registration and operating privilege.-- (1) The Department of Transportation shall suspend the registration of a vehicle for a period of three months if it determines the required financial responsibility was not secured as required by this chapter and shall suspend the operating privilege of the owner or registrant for a period of three months if the department determines that the owner or registrant has operated or permitted the operation of the vehicle without the required financial responsibility. The operating privilege shall not be restored until the restoration fee for operating privilege provided by section 1960 (relating to reinstatement of operating privilege or vehicle registration) is paid. (1.1) In lieu of serving a registration suspension imposed under this section, an owner or registrant may pay to the department a civil penalty of $500, the restoration fee prescribed under section 1960 and furnish proof of financial responsibility in a manner determined by the department. An owner or registrant may exercise this option no more than once in a 12-month period. (2) Whenever the department revokes or suspends the registration of any vehicle under this chapter, the department shall not restore or transfer the registration until the suspension has been served or the civil penalty has been paid to the department and the vehicle owner furnishes proof of financial responsibility in a manner determined by the department and submits an application for registration to the department, accompanied by the fee for restoration of registration provided by section 1960. This subsection shall not apply in the following circumstances: (i) The owner or registrant proves to the satisfaction of the department that the lapse in financial responsibility coverage was for a period of less than 31 days and that the owner or registrant did not operate or permit the operation of the vehicle during the period of lapse in financial responsibility. (ii) The owner or registrant is a member of the armed services of the United States, the owner or registrant has previously had the financial responsibility required by this chapter, financial responsibility had lapsed while the owner or registrant was on temporary, emergency duty and the vehicle was not operated during the period of lapse in financial responsibility. The exemption granted by this paragraph shall continue for 30 days after the owner or registrant returns from duty as long as the vehicle is not operated until the required financial responsibility has been established. (iii) The insurance coverage has terminated or financial responsibility has lapsed simultaneously with or subsequent to expiration of a seasonal registration, as provided in section 1307(a.1) (relating to period of registration). (3) An owner whose vehicle registration has been suspended under this subsection shall have the same right of appeal under section 1377 (relating to judicial review) as provided for in cases of the suspension of vehicle registration for other purposes. The filing of the appeal shall act as a supersedeas, and the suspension shall not be imposed until determination of the matter as provided in section 1377. The court's scope of review in an appeal from a vehicle registration suspension shall be limited to determining whether: (i) the vehicle is registered or of a type that is required to be registered under this title; and (ii) there has been either notice to the department of a lapse, termination or cancellation in the financial responsibility coverage as required by law for that vehicle or that the owner, registrant or driver was requested to provide proof of financial responsibility to the department, a police officer or another driver and failed to do so. Notice to the department of the lapse, termination or cancellation or the failure to provide the requested proof of financial responsibility shall create a presumption that the vehicle lacked the requisite financial responsibility. This presumption may be overcome by producing clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was insured at all relevant times. (4) Where an owner or registrant's operating privilege has been suspended under this subsection, the owner or registrant shall have the same right of appeal under section 1550 (relating to judicial review) as provided for in cases of suspension for other reason. The court's scope of review in an appeal from an operating privilege suspension shall be limited to determining whether: (i) the vehicle was registered or of a type required to be registered under this title; and (ii) the owner or registrant operated or permitted the operation of the same vehicle when it was not covered by financial responsibility. The fact that an owner, registrant or operator of the motor vehicle failed to provide competent evidence of insurance or the fact that the department received notice of a lapse, termination or cancellation of insurance for the vehicle shall create a presumption that the vehicle lacked the requisite financial responsibility. This presumption may be overcome by producing clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was insured at the time that it was driven. (5) An alleged lapse, cancellation or termination of a policy of insurance by an insurer may only be challenged by requesting review by the Insurance Commissioner pursuant to Article XX of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.682, No.284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921. Proof that a timely request has been made to the Insurance Commissioner for such a review shall act as a supersedeas, staying the suspension of registration or operating privilege under this section pending a determination pursuant to section 2009(a) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921 or, in the event that further review at a hearing is requested by either party, a final order pursuant to section 2009(i) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (6) The civil penalty collected under paragraph (1.1) shall be deposited into the Public Transportation Trust Fund. (e) Obligations upon lapse, termination or cancellation of financial responsibility.-- (1) An owner of a motor vehicle who ceases to maintain financial responsibility on a registered vehicle shall not operate or permit operation of the vehicle in this Commonwealth until proof of the required financial responsibility has been provided to the Department of Transportation. (2) An insurer who has issued a contract of motor vehicle liability insurance, or any approved self-insurance entity, shall notify the department in a timely manner and in a method prescribed by the department's regulations. Upon request of an owner or registrant in the case of an appeal brought by an owner or registrant for suspension under this section, an insurer shall provide a copy of the notice of cancellation or a copy of the insurer's filing procedures with proof that the notice was written in the normal course of business and placed in the normal course of mailing.

If acute care is provided in an acute care facility to a patient with an immediately life-threatening or urgent injury by a Level I or Level II trauma center accredited by the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation under the act of July 3, 1985 (P.L.164, No.45), known as the Emergency Medical Services Act, or to a major burn injury patient by a burn facility which meets all the service standards of the American Burn Association, the amount of payment may not exceed the usual and customary charge. Providers subject to this section may not bill the insured directly but must bill the insurer for a determination of the amount payable. The provider shall not bill or otherwise attempt to collect from the insured the difference between the provider's full charge and the amount paid by the insurer. (b) Peer review plan for challenges to reasonableness and necessity of treatment.-- (1) Peer review plan.-- Insurers shall contract jointly or separately with any peer review organization established for the purpose of evaluating treatment, health care services, products or accommodations provided to any injured person. Such evaluation shall be for the purpose of confirming that such treatment, products, services or accommodations conform to the professional standards of performance and are medically necessary. An insurer's challenge must be made to a PRO within 90 days of the insurer's receipt of the provider's bill for treatment or services or may be made at any time for continuing treatment or services. (2) PRO reconsideration.-- An insurer, provider or insured may request a reconsideration by the PRO of the PRO's initial determination. Such a request for reconsideration must be made within 30 days of the PRO's initial determination. If reconsideration is requested for the services of a physician or other licensed health care professional, then the reviewing individual must be, or the reviewing panel must include, an individual in the same specialty as the individual subject to review. (3) Pending determinations by PRO.-- If the insurer challenges within 30 days of receipt of a bill for medical treatment or rehabilitative services, the insurer need not pay the provider subject to the challenge until a determination has been made by the PRO. The insured may not be billed for any treatment, accommodations, products or services during the peer review process. (4) Appeal to court.-- A provider of medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise or an insured may challenge before a court an insurer's refusal to pay for past or future medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise, the reasonableness or necessity of which the insurer has not challenged before a PRO. Conduct considered to be wanton shall be subject to a payment of treble damages to the injured party. (5) PRO determination in favor of provider or insured.-- If a PRO determines that medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise were medically necessary, the insurer must pay to the provider the outstanding amount plus interest at 12% per year on any amount withheld by the insurer pending PRO review. (6) Court determination in favor of provider or insured.-- If, pursuant to paragraph (4), a court determines that medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise were medically necessary, the insurer must pay to the provider the outstanding amount plus interest at 12%, as well as the costs of the challenge and all attorney fees. (7) Determination in favor of insurer.-- If it is determined by a PRO or court that a provider has provided unnecessary medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise or that future provision of such treatment, services or merchandise will be unnecessary, or both, the provider may not collect payment for the medically unnecessary treatment, services or merchandise. If the provider has collected such payment, it must return the amount paid plus interest at 12% per year within 30 days. In no case does the failure of the provider to return the payment obligate the insured to assume responsibility for payment for the treatment, services or merchandise. (c) Review authorized.-- By December 1, 1991, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall commence a review of the impact of this section. Such review may be conducted biennially. (Feb. 12, 1984, P.L.53, No.12, eff. Oct. 1, 1984; Feb. 7, 1990, P.L.11, No.6, eff. Apr. 15, 1990) References in Text.

(d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart.

(2) The department has certified that it developed a program plan based on the assessment conducted under paragraph (1) that is designed to reduce the risk of recidivism through the use of recidivism risk reduction incentive programs authorized and approved under this chapter that are appropriate for that particular inmate. (3) The department advised the inmate that the inmate is required to successfully complete the program plan. (4) The inmate has successfully completed all required recidivism risk reduction incentive programs or other programs designated in the program plan. (5) The inmate has maintained a good conduct record following the imposition of the recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum sentence. (6) The reentry plan for the inmate is adequate. (7) Individual conditions and requirements for parole have been established. (8) Notice and opportunity to be heard was provided by the board to the sentencing court and the prosecuting attorney in a manner consistent with section 6137(g)(2) (relating to parole power). (9) The department has certified that the inmate continues to be an eligible offender. In the event that a recidivism risk reduction minimum sentence was imposed under section 4505(b) (relating to sentencing), the department certifies that it has not received additional information demonstrating a history of past or present violent behavior which was not available at the time of sentencing and the prosecuting attorney was unaware of that information at the time of sentencing. (10) There is no reasonable indication that the inmate poses a risk to public safety. (b) Funding.-- The department shall make all reasonable efforts to seek appropriate funding and resources in order to implement the recidivism risk reduction program. (c) Program content.-- Nothing in this section shall do any of the following: (1) Require the department to include recidivism risk reduction programs in an individual program plan where the risk assessment indicates that such a program is unlikely to reduce recidivism for that particular inmate. (2) Prohibit the department from including appropriate community works or public service projects as part of the program plan. (3) Prohibit the department from making modifications to the program plan at any time in order to ensure appropriate treatment and recidivism risk reduction incentive program placement.

(a) Restrictions based on condition of highway or bridge.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge only when they determine by conducting an engineering and traffic study as provided for in department regulations that the highway or bridge may be damaged or destroyed unless use by vehicles is prohibited or the permissible size or weight of vehicles is reduced. (2) School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (2.1) Government-owned vehicles, vehicles of local government agency contractors providing material for maintenance and department contractors engaged in or providing material for construction or maintenance shall be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways, except bridges, imposed under this subsection in accordance with department regulations. The following types of documents shall constitute evidence that a vehicle is traveling to or from a site in accordance with this paragraph: (i) A bill of lading. (ii) A shipping order. (iii) A service order or other document that indicates the address of the site and purpose of the trip. (3) The department may issue a statement of policy, which shall take effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, adopting an appropriate methodology to provide letters of local determination that identify particular vehicles, routes or uses as local in nature. (4) The methodology under paragraph (3) may allow for exemptions from 67 Pa. Code Ch. 189 (relating to hauling in excess of posted weight limit) related to the at-risk industry of logging or other forest products experiencing a 20% decline in Statewide employment between March 2002 and March 2011, as determined by the Department of Labor and Industry. (5) The exemptions and related requirements under paragraph (4) may remain in existence only until December 31, 2028. Exemptions for local delivery or pickup may not include traffic going to or coming from a site at which minerals, natural gas or natural resources are developed, harvested or extracted, notwithstanding whether the site is located at a residence, a commercial site or on farmland. Delivery or pickup of logs or other forest products to or from permanent processing mills located on or reachable only through posted highways shall be considered local delivery or pickup. Delivery or pickup of coal to or from permanent coal reprocessing or preparation plants located on or reachable only through posted highways and not on the same posted highway as a site at which coal is extracted shall be considered local delivery or pickup. (b) Restrictions based on traffic conditions.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdictions may prohibit the operation of vehicles and may impose restrictions as to the weight or size of vehicles operated upon a highway or bridge whenever they determine that hazardous traffic conditions or other safety factors require such a prohibition or restriction. School buses, emergency vehicles and vehicles making local deliveries or pickups may be exempted from restrictions on the use of highways imposed under this subsection. (c) Permits and security.-- (1) The Commonwealth and local authorities may issue permits for movement of vehicles of size and weight in excess of restrictions promulgated under subsections (a) and (b) with respect to highways and bridges under their jurisdiction and may require such agreement or security as they deem necessary to cover the cost of repairs and restoration necessitated by the permitted movement of vehicles. In reference to subsection (a), the Commonwealth and local authorities shall not refuse to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction if there is no reasonable alternate route available. For purposes of this section, \"reasonable alternate route\" shall mean a route meeting the criteria set forth in department regulations relating to traffic and engineering studies. (2) The department may establish the types of permits to be issued and agreements to be entered into, subject to the following: (i) Permits may be for long-term or short-term use of the posted highways. (ii) The department may require multiple vehicles traveling to or from a single destination to operate pursuant to a single permit. (iii) The department may establish a permit type allowing the posting authority to determine that damage to the posted highway covered by the permit will be minimal. This type of permit may include categories based on the number and kinds of loads expected, including a category providing that use of the posted highway under a single minimum-use permit of less than 700 loads per year shall not require an agreement or security. The department may alter the 700 loads per year minimum-use threshold if it determines the structural capacity of the State highways can accept a higher or lower amount of over-posted weight traffic. The department may express the threshold as a loads-per-day, loads-per-week or loads-per-month number. (iv) The department may restrict use of de minimis and minimum-use permits during thaw periods as determined by the department. (v) The department shall exclude hauling related to unconventional oil and gas development from minimum-use status based on its disproportionate and qualitatively different impact upon highways and bridges. (3) The department shall promulgate regulations to implement this section. During the two years immediately following the effective date of this section, the department may promulgate temporary regulations, which shall expire no later than three years following the effective date of this paragraph or upon promulgation of final regulations, whichever occurs first. Temporary regulations promulgated by the department under this paragraph shall not be subject to any of the following: (i) Sections 201, 202 and 203 of the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L.769, No.240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law. (ii) The Act of June 25, 1982 (P.L.633, No.181), known as the Regulatory Review Act. (d) Designation of alternate routes.-- (1) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsections (a) and (b), the Commonwealth may designate alternate routes for vehicles in excess of specified weights or sizes. Such alternate routes may utilize portions of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. (2) In conjunction with the exercise of the powers set forth in subsection (c), when refusing to issue a permit with respect to a highway under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an alternate route study. The elements of an engineering and traffic study conducted to designate an alternate route pursuant to this section shall consist of the same elements found in department regulations. (e) Erection of signs.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities shall erect or cause to be erected and maintained restriction signs designating the restrictions within 25 feet of each end of a bridge or portion of highway restricted as provided in subsection (a) or (b). In the case of a restriction on a bridge or on a highway which does not begin or end at an intersection with an unrestricted highway, the Commonwealth or local authorities shall also place an advance informational sign at the intersection nearest each end of the restricted bridge or portion of highway which would allow drivers to avoid the restricted bridge or portion of highway. No person shall be convicted of violating subsection (a) or (b) unless the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the direction the person was driving was posted as required in this subsection. However, failure to post the restriction sign designating the restricted bridge or portion of highway to traffic moving in the opposite direction or failure to post any advance informational sign shall not constitute a defense to a violation of this section. (f) Actions to be in accordance with department regulations.-- All actions taken under authority of this section shall be taken in accordance with department regulations. (f.1) Local ordinances superseded.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, local authorities are prohibited from enacting or enforcing ordinances inconsistent with the provisions contained in this section. (g) Penalty.-- (1) Any person operating a vehicle or combination upon a highway or bridge in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (a) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $75, except that any person convicted of operating a vehicle with a gross weight in excess of a posted weight shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $150 plus $150 for each 500 pounds, or part thereof, in excess of 3,000 pounds over the maximum allowable weight. (2) Any person operating a vehicle or combination in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under subsection (b) is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $500. (h) (Reserved). (i) Authority to conduct investigations and audits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may conduct or cause to be conducted an investigation and audit of a person or entity to determine if there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement. Audits shall be limited to proper usage of letters of local determination and de minimis and minimum-use permits. (j) Authority to suspend, revoke or deny permits.-- The Commonwealth and local authorities may suspend, revoke or deny a permit and agreement if it is determined by the Commonwealth or a local authority that there has been a violation of this section, pertinent regulation or agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

The tax shall be increased by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective January 1, 1985, and by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective July 1, 1985. Distributors shall be liable to the Commonwealth for the collection and payment of the tax imposed by this section. The tax shall be collected by the distributor and shall be paid to the Commonwealth only once with respect to any fuels. (b) Annual adjustment.-- Beginning on January 1, 1986, and each January 1 thereafter, the tax imposed under this section shall be adjusted annually and shall be set for that calendar year. The adjustment shall be based upon the percentage change of the Producer Price Index for Jet Fuel, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States Department of Labor, for the most recent 12-month period available as of the immediately preceding November 1. For every 10% increase or decrease in the Producer Price Index, as determined by comparing the index for the first month of the 12-month period with the index for the last month of the period, there shall be a 0.1¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, increase or decrease in the rate of tax.

The tax, as adjusted, shall never exceed 2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, nor shall it be less than 1.5¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof. (c) Construction of section.-- This section shall be construed in conjunction with the act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, as if jet fuels were liquid fuels as defined in that act, and all of the provisions of that act, except for section 4 thereof to the extent it imposes any tax, shall apply to the collection, administration and enforcement of the tax imposed under this section. Upon the effective date of the tax imposed by this section upon jet fuels, such jet fuels shall not be subject to the tax imposed by the act of January 14, 1952 (1951 P.L.1965, No.550), known as the Fuel Use Tax Act, except that dealer-users shall remain liable to report and pay the fuel use tax on any jet fuels used thereafter upon which the tax provided by this section has not been imposed. (d) Disposition of taxes.-- All moneys collected under this section shall be deposited by the State Treasurer in the Aviation Restricted Account. Effective Date of Tax.

(ii) It does not appear that the interests of the Commonwealth will be injured by the offender's parole. (2) Parole shall be subject in every instance to the Commonwealth's right to immediately retake and hold in custody without further proceedings any offender charged after his parole with an additional offense until a determination can be made whether to continue his parole status. (3) The power to parole granted under this section to the board may not be exercised in the board's discretion at any time before, but only after, the expiration of the minimum term of imprisonment fixed by the court in its sentence or by the Board of Pardons in a sentence which has been reduced by commutation. (3.1) (i) Following the expiration of the offender's minimum term of imprisonment, if the primary reason for not paroling the offender is the offender's inability to access and complete prescribed programming within the correctional institution, the board may release the offender on parole with the condition that the offender complete the prescribed programming while on parole. (ii) This paragraph shall not apply to offenders who are currently serving a term of imprisonment for a crime of violence as defined in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714 (relating to sentences for second and subsequent offenses) or for a crime requiring registration under 42 Pa.C.S.

(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as granting a right to be paroled to any person, and any decision by the board and its designees or the department, under this section shall not be considered an adjudication under 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 Subch. A (relating to practice and procedure of Commonwealth agencies) and Ch. 7 Subch. A (relating to judicial review of Commonwealth agency action).

(c) Technical violators.-- (1) Subject to paragraph (1.3), an offender under the jurisdiction of the board who violates the terms and conditions of his parole, other than a convicted violator who has parole revoked under subsection (a), may be detained pending a hearing before the board or waiver of the hearing or recommitted after a hearing before the board or a waiver of the hearing.

(d) Grounds for personal search of a department-supervised offender.-- (1) A personal search of an offender may be conducted by an agent: (i) if there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that the department-supervised offender possesses contraband or other evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision; (ii) when a department-supervised offender is transported or taken into custody; or (iii) upon a department-supervised offender entering or leaving the secure enclosure of a correctional institution, jail or detention facility.

(3) The department-supervised offender may be detained if the department-supervised offender is present during a property search. If the department-supervised offender is not present during a property search, the agent in charge of the search shall make a reasonable effort to provide the department-supervised offender with notice of the search, including a list of the items seized, after the search is completed. (4) The existence of reasonable suspicion to search shall be determined in accordance with constitutional search and seizure provisions as applied by judicial decision. In accordance with such case law, the following factors, where applicable, may be taken into account: (i) The observations of agents. (ii) Information provided by others. (iii) The activities of the department-supervised offender. (iv) Information provided by the department-supervised offender. (v) The experience of agents with the department-supervised offender. (vi) The experience of agents in similar circumstances. (vii) The prior criminal and supervisory history of the department-supervised offender.

The Interstate Corrections Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this State with any other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: INTERSTATE CORRECTIONS COMPACT ARTICLE I Purpose and Policy The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had. (c) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had. (d) \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution. (e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including, but not limited to, a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined. ARTICLE III Contracts (a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration. 2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance. 3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any, the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom. 4. Delivery and retaking of inmates. 5. Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states. (b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith. ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights (a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. (b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. (c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III. (d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state. (e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state. (f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. (g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory. (h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state. (i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact. ARTICLE V Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition (a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference. (b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VI Federal Aid Any state party to this compact may accept Federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such Federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provisions, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor. ARTICLE VII Entry into Force This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state. ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact. ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements. ARTICLE X Construction and Severability The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",
