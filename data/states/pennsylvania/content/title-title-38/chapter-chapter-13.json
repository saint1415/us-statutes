Truman on June 12, 1948.\n\n(9) That Federal law enabled women to serve as permanent, regular members of the United States Army, Marine Corps, Navy and the recently formed Air Force.\n\n(10) Throughout the years, the role of women continues to grow in all branches and phases of operations of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n(11) Currently, women serve freely alongside men in any branch or role they desire and comprise a substantial portion of new recruits, active duty members and reserve components of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n(12) Women Veterans Day is not considered a separate day for only women veterans, but a tribute to a groundbreaking day when women were acknowledged as essential to the war effort and could serve as permanent, regular members of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n(b) Designation.--June 12 of each year is designated as Women Veterans Day in this Commonwealth.\n\n(c) Proclamation.--The Governor shall issue annually a proclamation encouraging residents of this Commonwealth to observe Women Veterans Day and recognize the contributions of all women veterans and the sacrifices they made.\n\n(Nov. 3, 2022, P.L.1944, No.129, eff. imd.)\n\n2022 Amendment.Act 129 added section 1304.",

Johnson until the time of the return of peace and security to Vietnam.\n\n(5) In 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat units arrived in Vietnam.\n\n(6) By the end of 1965 there were 80,000 United States troops in Vietnam.\n\n(7) By 1969, a peak of approximately 543,000 troops was reached.\n\n(8) On January 27, 1973, the Paris Peace Accords were signed, requiring the release of all United States prisoners of war held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of all United States Armed Forces from South Vietnam.\n\n(9) On March 29, 1973, the United States Armed Forces completed the withdrawal of combat troops from Vietnam.\n\n(10) On March 30, 1973, the last of the United States Armed Forces landed at home.\n\n(11) More than 58,000 members of the United States Armed Forces lost their lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 members were wounded.\n\n(12) The Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue among the people of the United States and a conflict that caused a generation of veterans to wait too long for the public of the United States to acknowledge and honor the efforts and services of those veterans.\n\n(13) The members of the United States Armed Forces who served bravely and faithfully for the United States during the Vietnam War were often wrongly criticized for the decisions of policymakers that were beyond the control of those members.\n\n(14) In 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated by President Ronald Reagan in the District of Columbia to commemorate those members of the United States Armed Forces who died or were declared missing in action in Vietnam.\n\n(15) In 2012, President Barack Obama signed a presidential proclamation designating March 29 as the annual observance of Vietnam War Veterans Day.\n\n(16) In 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act of 2017 which designates March 29 each year as National Vietnam War Veterans Day and amended the United States Flag Code to include National Vietnam War Veterans Day as a day on which the flag should be flown.\n\n(b) Designation.--March 29 of each year is designated as Vietnam War Veterans Day in this Commonwealth.\n\n(c) Proclamation.--The Governor shall issue annually a proclamation encouraging all public schools and educational institutions to observe Vietnam War Veterans Day and conduct exercises recognizing the contributions of all those involved in the Vietnam War and remembering the sacrifices they made for their country.
