If an instrument falls within the definition of both \"note\" and \"draft,\" a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.\n\n(f) Definition of \"check\".--\"Check\" means:\n\n(1) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank; or\n\n(2) a cashier's check or teller's check.\n\nAn instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as \"money order.\"\n\n(g) Definition of \"cashier's check\".--\"Cashier's check\" means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.\n\n(h) Definition of \"teller's check\".--\"Teller's check\" means a draft drawn by a bank:\n\n(1) on another bank; or\n\n(2) payable at or through a bank.\n\n(i) Definition of \"traveler's check\".--\"Traveler's check\" means an instrument that:\n\n(1) is payable on demand;\n\n(2) is drawn on or payable at or through a bank;\n\n(3) is designated by the term \"traveler's check\" or by a substantially similar term; and\n\n(4) requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.\n\n(j) Definition of \"certificate of deposit\".--\"Certificate of deposit\" means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money.

An instrument that is conditionally issued or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.\n\n(c) Definition of \"issuer\".--\"Issuer\" applies to issued and unissued instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument.\n\n(July 1, 2024, P.L.450, No.41, eff. 60 days)\n\n2024 Amendment.Act 41 amended subsec.

If the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.\n\n(d) Promise or order not made conditional by containing certain statements required by law.--If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of section 3104(a); but if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.\n\nCross References.Section 3106 is referred to in section 3302 of this title.",

If more than one person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to any person intended by one or more of the signers.\n\n(b) When signature of issuer made by automated means.--If the signature of the issuer of an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing machine, the payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied the name or identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.\n\n(c) Identification of person to whom instrument is payable and rules for determining holder.--A person to whom an instrument is payable may be identified in any way, including by name, identifying number, office or account number.
