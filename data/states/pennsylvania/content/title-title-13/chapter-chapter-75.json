      "text": "(a) Tangible documents.--The following rules apply to a negotiable tangible document of title:\n\n(1) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person, the document is negotiated by the named person's indorsement and delivery. After the named person's indorsement in blank or to bearer, any person may negotiate the document by delivery alone.\n\n(2) If the document's original terms run to the bearer, it is negotiated by delivery alone.\n\n(3) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and it is delivered to the named person, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.\n\n(4) Negotiation of the document after it has been indorsed to a named person requires indorsement by the named person as well as delivery.\n\n(5) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves receiving the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.\n\n(b) Electronic documents.--The following rules apply to a negotiable electronic document of title:\n\n(1) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person or to the bearer, the document is negotiated by delivery of the document to another person. Indorsement by the named person is not required to negotiate the document.\n\n(2) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and the named person has control of the document, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.\n\n(3) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves taking delivery of the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.\n\n(c) Nonnegotiable documents.--Indorsement of a nonnegotiable document of title neither makes it negotiable nor adds to the transferee's rights.\n\n(d) Notice of interest.--The naming in a negotiable bill of lading of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods does not limit the negotiability of the bill or constitute notice to a purchaser of the bill of any interest of that person in the goods.",

      "text": "(a) Rights.--Subject to sections 7205 (relating to title under warehouse receipt defeated in certain cases) and 7503 (relating to document of title to goods defeated in certain cases), a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated acquires thereby all of the following:\n\n(1) Title to the document.\n\n(2) Title to the goods.\n\n(3) All rights accruing under the law of agency or estoppel, including rights to goods delivered to the bailee after the document was issued.\n\n(4) The direct obligation of the issuer to hold or deliver the goods according to the terms of the document free of any defense or claim by the issuer except those arising under the terms of the document or under this division. In the case of a delivery order, the bailee's obligation accrues only upon the bailee's acceptance of the delivery order, and the obligation acquired by the holder is that the issuer and any indorser will procure the acceptance of the bailee.\n\n(b) Effect of stoppage or surrender.--Subject to section 7503, title and rights acquired by due negotiation are not defeated by any stoppage of the goods represented by the document of title or by surrender of the goods by the bailee and are not impaired even if:\n\n(1) the due negotiation or any prior due negotiation constituted a breach of duty;\n\n(2) any person has been deprived of possession of a negotiable tangible document or control of a negotiable electronic document by misrepresentation, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft or conversion; or\n\n(3) a previous sale or other transfer of the goods or document has been made to a third person.",

      "text": "(a) General rule.--A document of title confers no right in goods against a person that before issuance of the document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:\n\n(1) deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's nominee with actual or apparent authority to ship, store or sell; with power to obtain delivery under section 7403 (relating to obligation of bailee to deliver; excuse); or with power of disposition under section 2403 (relating to power to transfer; good faith purchase of goods; \"entrusting\"), 2A304(a)(2) (relating to subsequent lease of goods by lessor), 2A305(a)(2) (relating to sale or sublease of goods by lessee), 9320 (relating to buyer of goods), 9321(c) (relating to licensee of general intangible and lessee of goods in ordinary course of business) or other statute or rule of law; or\n\n(2) acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.\n\n(b) Negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading.--Title to goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of any person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated. That title may be defeated under section 7504 (relating to rights acquired in absence of due negotiation; effect of diversion; stoppage of delivery) to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.\n\n(c) Freight forwarder.--Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of any person to which a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated. However, delivery by the carrier in accordance with Chapter 74 (relating to warehouse receipts and bills of lading: general obligations) pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to deliver.\n\nCross References.Section 7503 is referred to in sections 7403, 7502 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Transferee.--A transferee of a document of title, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, to which the document has been delivered but not duly negotiated, acquires the title and rights that its transferor had or had actual authority to convey.\n\n(b) Third parties.--In the case of a transfer of a nonnegotiable document of title, until but not after the bailee receives notice of the transfer, the rights of the transferee may be defeated:\n\n(1) by those creditors of the transferor that could treat the transfer as void under section 2402 (relating to rights of creditors of seller against sold goods) or 2A308 (relating to special rights of creditors);\n\n(2) by a buyer from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the buyer or received notification of the buyer's rights;\n\n(3) by a lessee from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the lessee or received notification of the lessee's rights; or\n\n(4) as against the bailee, by good faith dealings of the bailee with the transferor.\n\n(c) Diversion or change by consignor.--A diversion or other change of shipping instructions by the consignor in a nonnegotiable bill of lading which causes the bailee not to deliver the goods to the consignee:\n\n(1) defeats the consignee's title to the goods if the goods have been delivered to a buyer in ordinary course of business or a lessee in ordinary course of business; and\n\n(2) in any event defeats the consignee's rights against the bailee.\n\n(d) Stopping delivery.--Delivery of the goods pursuant to a nonnegotiable document of title may be stopped by a seller under section 2705 (relating to stoppage by seller of delivery in transit or otherwise) or a lessor under section 2A526 (relating to lessor's stoppage of delivery in transit or otherwise), subject to the requirements of due notification in those sections. A bailee honoring the seller's or lessor's instructions is entitled to be indemnified by the seller or lessor against any resulting loss or expense.\n\nCross References.Section 7504 is referred to in section 7503 of this title.",
