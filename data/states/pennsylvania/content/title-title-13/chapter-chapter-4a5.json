      "text": "(a) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \"creditor process\" means levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien, sequestration or similar process issued by or on behalf of a creditor or other claimant with respect to an account.\n\n(b) Creditor process served on receiving bank.--This subsection applies to creditor process with respect to an authorized account of the sender of a payment order if the creditor process is served on the receiving bank. For the purpose of determining rights with respect to the creditor process, if the receiving bank accepts the payment order, the balance in the authorized account is deemed to be reduced by the amount of the payment order to the extent the bank did not otherwise receive payment of the order, unless the creditor process is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank accepts the payment order.\n\n(c) Payment orders issued to beneficiary's bank.--If a beneficiary's bank has received a payment order for payment to the beneficiary's account in the bank, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) The bank may credit the beneficiary's account. The amount credited may be set off against an obligation owed by the beneficiary to the bank or may be applied to satisfy creditor process served on the bank with respect to the account.\n\n(2) The bank may credit the beneficiary's account and allow withdrawal of the amount credited unless creditor process with respect to the account is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act to prevent withdrawal.\n\n(3) If creditor process with respect to the beneficiary's account has been served and the bank has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it, the bank may not reject the payment order except for a reason unrelated to the service of process.\n\n(d) Creditor process served on beneficiary's bank.--Creditor process with respect to a payment by the originator to the beneficiary pursuant to a funds transfer may be served only on the beneficiary's bank with respect to the debt owed by that bank to the beneficiary. Any other bank served with the creditor process is not obliged to act with respect to the process.",

A funds-transfer system rule may also govern rights and obligations of parties other than participating banks using the system to the extent stated in sections 4A404(c) (relating to obligation of beneficiary's bank to pay and give notice to beneficiary), 4A405(d) (relating to payment by beneficiary's bank to beneficiary) and 4A507(c) (relating to choice of law).\n\nCross References.Section 4A501 is referred to in section 4A105 of this title.",

      "heading": "",
      "text": "(a) By agreement or funds-transfer system rule.--If, under this division, a receiving bank is obliged to pay interest with respect to a payment order issued to the bank, the amount payable may be determined:\n\n(1) by agreement of the sender and receiving bank; or\n\n(2) by a funds-transfer system rule if the payment order is transmitted through a funds-transfer system.\n\n(b) Method of calculation when not determined by agreement or rule.--If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in subsection (a), the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable Federal Funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable. The applicable Federal Funds rate is the average of the Federal Funds rates published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by 360. The Federal Funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank.",

      "text": "(a) General rule.--The following rules apply unless the affected parties otherwise agree or subsection (c) applies:\n\n(1) The rights and obligations between the sender of a payment order and the receiving bank are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the receiving bank is located.\n\n(2) The rights and obligations between the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.\n\n(3) The issue of when payment is made pursuant to a funds transfer by the originator to the beneficiary is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.\n\n(b) By agreement.--If the parties described in each paragraph of subsection (a) have made an agreement selecting the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern rights and obligations between each other, the law of that jurisdiction governs those rights and obligations, whether or not the payment order or the funds transfer bears a reasonable relation to that jurisdiction.\n\n(c) By funds-transfer system rule.--A funds-transfer system rule may select the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern:\n\n(1) rights and obligations between participating banks with respect to payment orders transmitted or processed through the system; or\n\n(2) the rights and obligations of some or all parties to a funds transfer, any part of which is carried out by means of the system.\n\nA choice of law made pursuant to paragraph (1) is binding on participating banks. A choice of law made pursuant to paragraph (2) is binding on the originator, other sender or a receiving bank having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system when the originator, other sender or receiving bank issued or accepted a payment order. The beneficiary of a funds transfer is bound by the choice of law if, when the funds transfer is initiated, the beneficiary has notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system. The law of a jurisdiction selected pursuant to this subsection may govern, whether or not that law bears a reasonable relation to the matter in issue.\n\n(d) Inconsistency between agreement and rule.--In the event of inconsistency between an agreement under subsection (b) and a choice-of-law rule under subsection (c), the agreement under subsection (b) prevails.\n\n(e) Inconsistency between choice-of-law rules of systems.--If a funds transfer is made by use of more than one funds-transfer system and there is inconsistency between choice-of-law rules of the system, the matter in issue is governed by the law of the selected jurisdiction that has the most significant relationship to the matter in issue.\n\nCross References.Section 4A507 is referred to in sections 1301, 4A501 of this title.",
