A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if:\n\n(1) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer; and\n\n(2) the customer expressly agreed in a record to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank's obligations under the security procedure chosen by the customer.\n\n(d) Definition of \"sender\".--The term \"sender\" in this division includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (a), or it is effective as the order of the customer under subsection (b).\n\n(e) Amendments and cancellations of payment orders.--This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.\n\n(f) Rights and obligations.--Except as provided in this section and in section 4A203(a)(1) (relating to unenforceability of certain verified payment orders), rights and obligations arising under this section or section 4A203 may not be varied by agreement.\n\n(July 1, 2024, P.L.450, No.41, eff. 60 days)\n\n2024 Amendment.Act 41 amended subsecs.

In that case, the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary the excess amount received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.\n\n(b) Duty of sender.--If the sender of an erroneous payment order described in subsection (a) is not obliged to pay all or part of the order and the sender receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was accepted by the bank or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care, on the basis of information available to the sender, to discover the error with respect to the order and to advise the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time, not exceeding 90 days, after the bank's notification was received by the sender.

The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.\n\n(2) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.\n\n(c) Applicable rules when bank pays person identified by number.--If a payment order described in subsection (b) is accepted, the originator's payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number and the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection (b)(1), the following rules apply:\n\n(1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.\n\n(2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence.

A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order, any means complying with the agreement is reasonable and any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.\n\n(b) When sender learns after execution date that sender's order has not been executed.--This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order.
