      "text": "(a) Payment for accepted goods.--The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods accepted.\n\n(b) Effect of acceptance on remedies for breach.--Acceptance of goods by the buyer precludes rejection of the goods accepted and if made with knowledge of a nonconformity cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured but acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this division for nonconformity.\n\n(c) Notice of breach.--Where a tender has been accepted:\n\n(1) the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy; and\n\n(2) if the claim is one for infringement or the like (section 2312(c)) and the buyer is sued as a result of such a breach he must so notify the seller within a reasonable time after he receives notice of the litigation or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation.\n\n(d) Burden of establishing breach.--The burden is on the buyer to establish any breach with respect to the goods accepted.\n\n(e) Notice of litigation to person answerable over.--Where the buyer is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which his seller is answerable over:\n\n(1) He may give his seller written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the seller may come in and defend and that if the seller does not do so he will be bound in any action against him by his buyer by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the seller after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend he is so bound.\n\n(2) If the claim is one for infringement or the like (section 2312(c)), the original seller may demand in writing that his buyer turn over to him control of the litigation including settlement or else be barred from any remedy over and if he also agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the buyer after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the buyer is so barred.\n\n(f) Obligation of buyer to hold seller harmless.--The provisions of subsections (c), (d) and (e) apply to any obligation of a buyer to hold the seller harmless against infringement or the like (section 2312(c) (relating to warranty of merchant regularly dealing in goods)).\n\nCross References.Section 2607 is referred to in section 2714 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) When allowable.--Until the next performance is due by the repudiating party he can retract his repudiation unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled or materially changed his position or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final.\n\n(b) Method.--Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance justifiably demanded under the provisions of this division (section 2609).\n\n(c) Effect on contract rights.--Retraction reinstates the rights of the repudiating party under the contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation.",

      "text": "(a) Definition of \"installment contract\".--An \"installment contract\" is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause \"each delivery is a separate contract\" or its equivalent.\n\n(b) Right to reject nonconforming installment.--The buyer may reject any installment which is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (c) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.\n\n(c) Breach.--Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole. But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a nonconforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.\n\nCross References.Section 2612 is referred to in sections 2103, 2601, 2616, 2703, 2711 of this title.",

He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.\n\n(3) The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or nondelivery and, when allocation is required under paragraph (2), of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.\n\nCross References.Section 2615 is referred to in section 2616 of this title.",

If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the obligation of the buyer unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.\n\nCross References.Section 2614 is referred to in section 2615 of this title.",
