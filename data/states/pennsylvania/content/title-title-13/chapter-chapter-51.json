      "text": "(a) Fraud and forgery generally.--If a presentation is made that appears on its face strictly to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit, but a required document is forged or materially fraudulent, or honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant:\n\n(1) the issuer shall honor the presentation if honor is demanded by:\n\n(i) a nominated person who has given value in good faith and without notice of forgery or material fraud;\n\n(ii) a confirmer who has honored its confirmation in good faith;\n\n(iii) a holder in due course of a draft drawn under the letter of credit which was taken after acceptance by the issuer or nominated person; or\n\n(iv) an assignee of the issuer's or nominated person's deferred obligation that was taken for value and without notice of forgery or material fraud after the obligation was incurred by the issuer or nominated person; and\n\n(2) the issuer, acting in good faith, may honor or dishonor the presentation in any other case.\n\n(b) Conditions for injunction.--If an applicant claims that a required document is forged or materially fraudulent or that honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant, a court of competent jurisdiction may temporarily or permanently enjoin the issuer from honoring a presentation or grant similar relief against the issuer or other persons only if the court finds that:\n\n(1) the relief is not prohibited under the law applicable to an accepted draft or deferred obligation incurred by the issuer;\n\n(2) a beneficiary, issuer or nominated person who may be adversely affected is adequately protected against loss that it may suffer because the relief is granted;\n\n(3) all of the conditions to entitle a person to the relief under the law of this Commonwealth have been met; and\n\n(4) on the basis of the information submitted to the court, the applicant is more likely than not to succeed under its claim of forgery or material fraud and the person demanding honor does not qualify for protection under subsection (a)(1).\n\nSpecial Provisions in Appendix.See section 28 of Act 18 of 2001 in the appendix to this title for special provisions relating to applicability of transitional provisions.\n\nCross References.Section 5109 is referred to in sections 2512, 5108, 5110, 5113, 9700 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Undisclosed successor.--A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents and receive payment or other items of value in the name of the beneficiary without disclosing its status as a successor.\n\n(b) Disclosed successor.--A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents and receive payment or other items of value in its own name as the disclosed successor of the beneficiary. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), an issuer shall recognize a disclosed successor of a beneficiary as beneficiary in full substitution for its predecessor upon compliance with the requirements for recognition by the issuer of a transfer of drawing rights by operation of law under the standard practice referred to in section 5108(e) (relating to standard practice) or, in the absence of such a practice, compliance with other reasonable procedures sufficient to protect the issuer.\n\n(c) Determination of successor status, signature.--An issuer is not obliged to determine whether a purported successor is a successor of a beneficiary or whether the signature of a purported successor is genuine or authorized.\n\n(d) Effect of honor of presentation by purported successor.--Honor of a purported successor's apparently complying presentation under subsection (a) or (b) has the consequences specified in section 5108(i) (relating to certain consequences of honor) even if the purported successor is not the successor of a beneficiary. Documents signed in the name of the beneficiary or of a disclosed successor by a person who is neither the beneficiary nor the successor of the beneficiary are forged documents for the purposes of section 5109 (relating to fraud and forgery).\n\n(e) Right to decline to recognize presentation.--An issuer whose rights of reimbursement are not covered by subsection (d) or substantially similar law and any confirmer or nominated person may decline to recognize a presentation under subsection (b).\n\n(f) Change of name.--A beneficiary whose name is changed after the issuance of a letter of credit has the same rights and obligations as a successor of a beneficiary under this section.\n\nSpecial Provisions in Appendix.See section 28 of Act 18 of 2001 in the appendix to this title for special provisions relating to applicability of transitional provisions.\n\nCross References.Section 5113 is referred to in sections 5108, 5112, 9700 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \"proceeds of a letter of credit\" means the cash, check, accepted draft or other item of value paid or delivered upon honor or giving of value by the issuer or any nominated person under the letter of credit. The term does not include a beneficiary's drawing rights or documents presented by the beneficiary.\n\n(b) Beneficiary's right to assign proceeds.--A beneficiary may assign its right to part or all of the proceeds of a letter of credit. The beneficiary may do so before presentation as a present assignment of its right to receive proceeds contingent upon its compliance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.\n\n(c) Recognition of assignment of proceeds.--An issuer or nominated person need not recognize an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit until it consents to the assignment.\n\n(d) Consent to assignment of proceeds.--An issuer or nominated person has no obligation to give or withhold its consent to an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit, but consent may not be unreasonably withheld if the assignee possesses and exhibits the letter of credit and presentation of the letter of credit is a condition to honor.\n\n(e) Rights of transferee beneficiary or nominated person.--Rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person are independent of the beneficiary's assignment of the proceeds of a letter of credit and are superior to the assignee's right to the proceeds.\n\n(f) Certain rights not affected; relationship to Division 9.--Neither the rights recognized by this section between an assignee and an issuer, transferee beneficiary or nominated person nor the issuer's or nominated person's payment of proceeds to an assignee or a third person affect the rights between the assignee and any person other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary or nominated person. The mode of creating and perfecting a security interest in or granting an assignment of a beneficiary's right to proceeds is governed by Division 9 (relating to secured transactions) or other law. Against persons other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary or nominated person, the rights and obligations arising upon the creation of a security interest or other assignment of a beneficiary's right to proceeds and its perfection are governed by Division 9 or other law.\n\nSpecial Provisions in Appendix.See section 28 of Act 18 of 2001 in the appendix to this title for special provisions relating to applicability of transitional provisions.\n\nCross References.Section 5114 is referred to in sections 5103, 9102, 9107, 9109, 9700 of this title.",

If more than one address is indicated, the branch is considered to be located at the address from which the undertaking was issued.\n\n(e) Role of custom or practice.--Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the liability of an issuer, nominated person or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice, such as the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, to which the letter of credit, confirmation or other undertaking is expressly made subject.
