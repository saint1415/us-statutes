      "text": "(a) When transfer effected.--An instrument is transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument.\n\n(b) Rights obtained upon transfer of instrument.--Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument.\n\n(c) Right of transferee to demand indorsement.--Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified indorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made.\n\n(d) Effect of transfer of less than entire instrument.--If a transferor purports to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of the instrument does not occur. The transferee obtains no rights under this division and has only the rights of a partial assignee.\n\nCross References.Section 3203 is referred to in section 3103 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Definition of \"indorsement\".--\"Indorsement\" means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer or acceptor, that alone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of negotiating the instrument, restricting payment of the instrument or incurring indorser's liability on the instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a purpose other than indorsement. For the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.\n\n(b) Definition of \"indorser\".--\"Indorser\" means a person who makes an indorsement.\n\n(c) When transferee is a holder.--For the purpose of determining whether the transferee of an instrument is a holder, an indorsement that transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective as an unqualified indorsement of the instrument.\n\n(d) Wrong name.--If an instrument is payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, indorsement may be made by the holder in the name stated in the instrument or in the holder's name or both, but signature in both names may be required by a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection.\n\nCross References.Section 3204 is referred to in section 3103 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Special indorsement.--If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument, whether payable to an identified person or payable to bearer, and the indorsement identifies a person to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a \"special indorsement.\" When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of that person. The principles stated in section 3110 (relating to identification of person to whom instrument is payable) apply to special indorsements.\n\n(b) Blank indorsement.--If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a \"blank indorsement.\" When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed.\n\n(c) Conversion of blank indorsement into special indorsement.--The holder may convert a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words identifying the person to whom the instrument is made payable.\n\n(d) Definition of \"anomalous indorsement\".--\"Anomalous indorsement\" means an indorsement made by a person who is not the holder of the instrument. An anomalous indorsement does not affect the manner in which the instrument may be negotiated.\n\nCross References.Section 3205 is referred to in sections 3103, 3109 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Indorsement prohibiting further transfer or negotiation.--An indorsement limiting payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibiting further transfer or negotiation of the instrument is not effective to prevent further transfer or negotiation of the instrument.\n\n(b) Conditional indorsement.--An indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect the right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it for value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person are not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled.\n\n(c) Specified purpose indorsement.--If an instrument bears an indorsement described in section 4201(b) (relating to status of collecting bank as agent and provisional status of credits; applicability of division; item indorsed \"pay any bank\") or in blank or to a particular bank using the words \"for deposit,\" \"for collection\" or other words indicating a purpose of having the instrument collected by a bank for the indorser or for a particular account, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) A person, other than a bank, who purchases the instrument when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid for the instrument is received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.\n\n(2) A depositary bank that purchases the instrument or takes it for collection when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid by the bank with respect to the instrument is received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.\n\n(3) A payor bank that is also the depositary bank or that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter from a person other than a collecting bank converts the instrument unless the proceeds of the instrument are received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.\n\n(4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), a payor bank or intermediary bank may disregard the indorsement and is not liable if the proceeds of the instrument are not received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.\n\n(d) Indorsement for benefit of indorser or another person.--Except for an indorsement covered by subsection (c), if an instrument bears an indorsement using words to the effect that payment is to be made to the indorsee as agent, trustee or other fiduciary for the benefit of the indorser or another person, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) Unless there is notice of breach of fiduciary duty as provided in section 3307 (relating to notice of breach of fiduciary duty), a person who purchases the instrument from the indorsee or takes the instrument from the indorsee for collection or payment may pay the proceeds of payment or the value given for the instrument to the indorsee without regard to whether the indorsee violates a fiduciary duty to the indorser.\n\n(2) A subsequent transferee of the instrument or person who pays the instrument is neither given notice nor otherwise affected by the restriction in the indorsement unless the transferee or payor knows that the fiduciary dealt with the instrument or its proceeds in breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n(e) Holder in due course.--The presence on an instrument of an indorsement to which this section applies does not prevent a purchaser of the instrument from becoming a holder in due course of the instrument unless the purchaser is a converter under subsection (c) or has notice or knowledge of breach of fiduciary duty as stated in subsection (d).\n\n(f) Defense of obligor.--In an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the obligor has a defense if payment would violate an indorsement to which this section applies and the payment is not permitted by this section.\n\nCross References.Section 3206 is referred to in section 4203 of this title.",

A former holder who reacquires the instrument may cancel indorsements made after the reacquirer first became a holder of the instrument.

An indorser whose indorsement is canceled is discharged, and the discharge is effective against any subsequent holder.\n\nCross References.Section 3207 is referred to in section 3103 of this title.",
