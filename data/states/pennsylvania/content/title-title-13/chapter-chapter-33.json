      "text": "(a) Definition of \"holder in due course\".--Subject to subsection (c) and section 3106(d) (relating to unconditional promise or order), \"holder in due course\" means the holder of an instrument if:\n\n(1) the instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity; and\n\n(2) the holder took the instrument:\n\n(i) for value;\n\n(ii) in good faith;\n\n(iii) without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series;\n\n(iv) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered;\n\n(v) without notice of any claim to the instrument described in section 3306 (relating to claims to an instrument); and\n\n(vi) without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in section 3305(a) (relating to defenses and claims in recoupment).\n\n(b) Notice of discharge.--Notice of discharge of a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding, is not notice of a defense under subsection (a), but discharge is effective against a person who became a holder in due course with notice of the discharge. Public filing or recording of a document does not of itself constitute notice of a defense, claim in recoupment or claim to the instrument.\n\n(c) When one does not acquire rights of holder in due course.--Except to the extent a transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder in due course, a person does not acquire rights of a holder in due course of an instrument taken:\n\n(1) by legal process or by purchase in an execution, bankruptcy or creditor's sale or similar proceeding;\n\n(2) by purchase as part of a bulk transaction not in ordinary course of business of the transferor; or\n\n(3) as the successor in interest to an estate or other organization.\n\n(d) Limited right as holder in due course; partial performance.--If, under section 3303(a)(1) (relating to value and consideration), the promise of performance that is the consideration for an instrument has been partially performed, the holder may assert rights as a holder in due course of the instrument only to the fraction of the amount payable under the instrument equal to the value of the partial performance divided by the value of the promised performance.\n\n(e) Limited right as holder in due course; security interest.--If:\n\n(1) the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest in the instrument; and\n\n(2) the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment or claim to the instrument that may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest;\n\nthe person entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which, at the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured.\n\n(f) Manner of notice.--To be effective, notice must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a reasonable opportunity to act on it.\n\n(g) Applicability of other law.--This section is subject to any law limiting status as a holder in due course in particular classes of transactions.\n\nCross References.Section 3302 is referred to in sections 3103, 4104, 4205, 4211, 9102 of this title.",

The drawer or maker of an instrument has a defense if the instrument is issued without consideration. If an instrument is issued for a promise of performance, the issuer has a defense to the extent performance of the promise is due and the promise has not been performed.

An obligor is not obliged to pay the instrument if the person seeking enforcement of the instrument does not have rights of a holder in due course and the obligor proves that the instrument is a lost or stolen instrument.\n\n(d) Instrument signed for accommodation.--In an action to enforce the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument, the accommodation party may assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument any defense or claim in recoupment under subsection (a) that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings, infancy and lack of legal capacity.\n\nCross References.Section 3305 is referred to in sections 3302, 4207, 9403 of this title.",

If the validity of a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed principal of a person who signed the instrument as a party to the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant is liable on the instrument as a represented person under section 3402(a) (relating to signature by representative).\n\n(b) Status as holder in due course.--If the validity of signatures is admitted or proved and there is compliance with subsection (a), a plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under section 3301 (relating to person entitled to enforce instrument), unless the defendant proves a defense or claim in recoupment. If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course which are not subject to the defense or claim.\n\nCross References.Section 3308 is referred to in section 3309 of this title.",
