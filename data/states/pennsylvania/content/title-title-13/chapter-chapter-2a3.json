      "text": "(a) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \"creation of a security interest\" includes the sale of a lease contract that is subject to Division 9 (relating to secured transactions) by reason of section 9109(a)(3) (relating to scope).\n\n(b) General rule.--Except as provided in subsection (c) and section 9407 (relating to restrictions on creation or enforcement of security interest in leasehold interest or in lessor's residual interest), a provision in a lease agreement which:\n\n(1) prohibits the voluntary or involuntary transfer, including a transfer by sale, sublease, creation or enforcement of a security interest, or attachment, levy or other judicial process, of an interest of a party under the lease contract or of the lessor's residual interest in the goods; or\n\n(2) makes such a transfer an event of default;\n\ngives rise to the rights and remedies provided in subsection (d), but a transfer that is prohibited or is an event of default under the lease agreement is otherwise effective.\n\n(c) Transfer of right to damages.--A provision in a lease agreement which:\n\n(1) prohibits a transfer of a right to damages for default with respect to the whole lease contract or of a right to payment arising out of the transferor's due performance of the transferor's entire obligation; or\n\n(2) makes such a transfer an event of default;\n\nis not enforceable, and such a transfer is not a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the other party to the lease contract within the purview of subsection (d).\n\n(d) Certain rights and remedies.--Subject to subsection (c) and section 9407:\n\n(1) If a transfer is made which is made an event of default under a lease agreement, the party to the lease contract not making the transfer, unless that party waives the default or otherwise agrees, has the rights and remedies described in section 2A501(b) (relating to default: procedure).\n\n(2) If paragraph (1) is not applicable and if a transfer is made that is prohibited under a lease agreement or materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the other party to the lease contract, unless the party not making the transfer agrees at any time to the transfer in the lease contract or otherwise, then, except as limited by contract, the transferor is liable to the party not making the transfer for damages caused by the transfer to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the party not making the transfer and a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the lease contract or an injunction against the transfer.\n\n(e) Effect and enforceability of general transfer.--A transfer of \"the lease\" or of \"all my rights under the lease\" or a transfer in similar general terms is a transfer of rights, and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee. Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties. The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract.\n\n(f) Effect of delegation of performance.--Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or any liability for default.\n\n(g) Requirements for prohibition of transfer in consumer lease.--In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party under the lease contract or to make a transfer an event of default, the language must be specific, by a writing and conspicuous.\n\n(June 8, 2001, P.L.123, No.18, eff.

To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage.\n\n(g) Priority of interest in other cases.--In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate.\n\n(h) Removal of goods if interest of lessor has priority.--If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may:\n\n(1) on default, expiration, termination or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this division; or\n\n(2) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this division;\n\nremove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.\n\n(i) Perfection of interest of lessor.--Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of Division 9 (relating to secured transactions).\n\n(June 8, 2001, P.L.123, No.18, eff.
