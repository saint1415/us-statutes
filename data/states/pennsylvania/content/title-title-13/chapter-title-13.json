      "text": "§ 7102. Interstate Corrections Compact. The Interstate Corrections Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this State with any other states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: INTERSTATE CORRECTIONS COMPACT ARTICLE I Purpose and Policy The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, thereby serving the best interests of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) \"State\" means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had. (c) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had. (d) \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution. (e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including, but not limited to, a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined. ARTICLE III Contracts (a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration. 2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance. 3. Participation in programs of inmate employment, if any, the disposition or crediting of any payments received by inmates on account thereof; and the crediting of proceeds from or disposal of any products resulting therefrom. 4. Delivery and retaking of inmates. 5. Such other matters as may be necessary and appropriate to fix the obligations, responsibilities and rights of the sending and receiving states. (b) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith. ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights (a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. (b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. (c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III. (d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state. (e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state. (f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. (g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory. (h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state. (i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact. ARTICLE V Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State: Extradition (a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference. (b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VI Federal Aid Any state party to this compact may accept Federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such Federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provisions, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor. ARTICLE VII Entry into Force This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state. ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact. ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements. ARTICLE X Construction and Severability The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.",

(2) Recording an instrument conveying or leasing to the association the real estate to be included in the cooperative, which instrument also includes all provisions required to be in a declaration by section 4205 (relating to contents of declaration) and which instrument shall then be deemed to be a declaration for all purposes of this subpart. (b) Execution of instrument.-- The instrument by which the conveyance or lease to the association of the real estate to be in the cooperative is to be effected shall be executed and acknowledged by the association as well as by all persons having an interest in the real estate to be included in the cooperative and whose interest is being conveyed to or subjected to a lease in favor of the association. (c) Recording instruments.-- The declaration and any separate instrument of conveyance or lease of the real estate to the association must be recorded in every county in which any portion of the cooperative is located and must be indexed in the grantee's index in the name of the cooperative and the association and in the grantor's index in the name of every person executing the declaration and such separate instrument.

Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, the unit's allocated votes and liabilities shall automatically be reallocated to the remaining units in proportion to the respective allocated votes and liabilities of those units before the taking. The association shall promptly prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Any remnant of a unit remaining after part of a unit is taken under this subsection shall be a common facility. (b) Acquisition of part of unit.-- Except as provided in subsection (a), if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain, the award shall compensate the unit owner for the reduction in value of the unit and its appurtenant interest in the planned community, whether or not any common facilities or controlled facilities are acquired, and shall compensate the association for the value, if any, of the interest of other units in any controlled facilities that were at the time of the taking a part of the unit subject to the taking. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, the following shall apply: (1) The unit's appurtenant votes in the association and common expense liability shall be reduced on the basis specified in the declaration with respect to the reallocation of votes and common expense liability in the event of eminent domain or, if the declaration does not specify a basis, as initially allocated based on the formulae stated in the declaration under section 5208 (relating to allocation of votes and common expense liabilities). (2) The portion of the appurtenant votes and common expense liability divested from the partially acquired unit shall be automatically reallocated to that unit and the remaining units in proportion to the respective appurtenant votes and liabilities of those units before the taking, with the partially acquired unit participating in the reallocation on the basis of its reduced allocated votes and liabilities. (c) Acquisition of part of common facilities.-- If part of the common facilities is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the award attributable to the interest of the association in the common facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining common facilities among the unit owners in proportion to the common expense liability attributable to the units before the taking, but any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common facility shall be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that limited common facility was allocated at the time of acquisition or in any manner as provided in the declaration. (d) Acquisition of part of controlled facilities.-- If, as part of a unit acquired by eminent domain, controlled facilities are taken which benefit other units, that portion of the award attributable to the interest of the other units in the controlled facilities taken shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining controlled facilities equally among the unit owners whose units were benefited by the controlled facilities that have been taken.

(c) Holders of conflicting inventory security interests to be notified.-- Subsection (b)(2) through (4) apply only if the holder of the conflicting security interest had filed a financing statement covering the same types of inventory: (1) if the purchase-money security interest is perfected by filing, before the date of the filing; or (2) if the purchase-money security interest is temporarily perfected without filing or possession under section 9312(f) (relating to perfection of security interests in chattel paper, controllable accounts, controllable electronic records, controllable payment intangibles, deposit accounts, documents, goods covered by documents, instruments, investment property, letter-of-credit rights and money; perfection by permissive filing; temporary perfection without filing or transfer of possession), before the beginning of the 20-day period thereunder.

(e) Holders of conflicting livestock security interests to be notified.-- Subsection (d)(2) through (4) apply only if the holder of the conflicting security interest had filed a financing statement covering the same types of livestock: (1) if the purchase-money security interest is perfected by filing, before the date of the filing; or (2) if the purchase-money security interest is temporarily perfected without filing or possession under section 9312(f), before the beginning of the 20-day period thereunder. (f) Software purchase-money priority.-- Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in software has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same collateral; and, except as otherwise provided in section 9327, a perfected security interest in its identifiable proceeds also has priority, to the extent that the purchase-money security interest in the goods in which the software was acquired for use has priority in the goods and proceeds of the goods under this section. (g) Conflicting purchase-money security interests.-- If more than one security interest qualifies for priority in the same collateral under subsection (a), (b), (d) or (f): (1) a security interest securing an obligation incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral has priority over a security interest securing an obligation incurred for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of collateral; and (2) in all other cases, section 9322(a) (relating to general priority rules) applies to the qualifying security interests.

(a) Staggered renewal system to be established.-- The department shall establish a system of staggered registration renewal in a manner that an approximately equal number of registrations will expire every month throughout the year. In order to implement and maintain the staggered registration system, the department may prorate annual registration fees over registration periods of from 6 to 18 months. (a.1) Seasonal registration.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a passenger car, recreational motor vehicle, motorcycle, truck or farm vehicle which does not have a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 14,000 pounds may register the vehicle with the department for a period of successive months of less than one year. The applicant shall specify the period of months during which the vehicle shall be registered. Except when the department initially converts a currently valid annual registration to a seasonal registration, the annual fee prescribed for the vehicle by Chapter 19 (relating to fees) shall be paid in full by the applicant regardless of the number of months chosen for registration by the applicant. Upon receipt of the appropriate fee and the properly completed form, including all information required by this chapter, the department shall issue a seasonal registration that shall expire on the last day of the expiration month chosen by the registrant. No insurer of a vehicle belonging to any owner or lessee who obtains a seasonal registration and who applies for or receives a reduced automobile insurance premium on account thereof shall be required to provide any contractual coverage, whether in the form of the provision of a defense or the payment of first-party or third-party benefits or otherwise, to the owner or lessee in connection with any event occurring during that part of the year in which the vehicle is not registered; and such owner or lessee shall be treated for all purposes, including, without limitation, ascertaining rights to stack coverages and to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, as a person who does not own that vehicle and has no duty to carry financial responsibility on it for that part of the year. (b) New registration.-- A new registration is effective on the date of issuance of a registration card by the department or the date of issuance of a temporary registration card by an authorized agent of the department under section 1310 (relating to temporary registration cards). (c) Renewal of registration.-- A renewed registration shall be effective on issuance by the department of a renewed registration card. (d) Expiration of registration.-- A registration shall expire on the last day of the month designated on the registration card. (e) Antique, classic and collectible vehicles.-- Antique, classic and collectible motor vehicle registrations shall expire upon the salvaging, scrapping or transfer of ownership of the vehicle, except that if the transfer is between spouses or between parent and child the registration may be transferred upon payment of a transfer fee. (f) Optional permanent trailer registration.-- Except as set forth in section 1920(c) (relating to trailers), the registration of trailers permanently registered as provided in section 1920(c) shall expire upon salvaging of the vehicle or transfer of ownership. (g) Election.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a motor vehicle, except a motor vehicle registered under the International Registration Plan and a motor vehicle with a seasonal registration or a circus or carnival plate, may elect to pay an annual registration fee for a two-year period. The fee shall be two times the amount of the registration fee otherwise payable for the motor vehicle under this title.

(a) Staggered renewal system to be established.-- The department shall establish a system of staggered registration renewal in a manner that an approximately equal number of registrations will expire every month throughout the year. In order to implement and maintain the staggered registration system, the department may prorate annual registration fees over registration periods of from 6 to 18 months. (a.1) Seasonal registration.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a passenger car, recreational motor vehicle, motorcycle, truck or farm vehicle which does not have a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 14,000 pounds may register the vehicle with the department for a period of successive months of less than one year. The applicant shall specify the period of months during which the vehicle shall be registered. Except when the department initially converts a currently valid annual registration to a seasonal registration, the annual fee prescribed for the vehicle by Chapter 19 (relating to fees) shall be paid in full by the applicant regardless of the number of months chosen for registration by the applicant. Upon receipt of the appropriate fee and the properly completed form, including all information required by this chapter, the department shall issue a seasonal registration that shall expire on the last day of the expiration month chosen by the registrant. No insurer of a vehicle belonging to any owner or lessee who obtains a seasonal registration and who applies for or receives a reduced automobile insurance premium on account thereof shall be required to provide any contractual coverage, whether in the form of the provision of a defense or the payment of first-party or third-party benefits or otherwise, to the owner or lessee in connection with any event occurring during that part of the year in which the vehicle is not registered; and such owner or lessee shall be treated for all purposes, including, without limitation, ascertaining rights to stack coverages and to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, as a person who does not own that vehicle and has no duty to carry financial responsibility on it for that part of the year. (b) New registration.-- A new registration is effective on the date of issuance of a registration card by the department or the date of issuance of a temporary registration card by an authorized agent of the department under section 1310 (relating to temporary registration cards). (c) Renewal of registration.-- A renewed registration shall be effective on issuance by the department of a renewed registration card. (d) Expiration of registration.-- A registration shall expire on the last day of the month designated on the registration card. (e) Antique, classic and collectible vehicles.-- Antique, classic and collectible motor vehicle registrations shall expire upon the salvaging, scrapping or transfer of ownership of the vehicle, except that if the transfer is between spouses or between parent and child the registration may be transferred upon payment of a transfer fee. (f) Optional permanent trailer registration.-- Except as set forth in section 1920(c) (relating to trailers), the registration of trailers permanently registered as provided in section 1920(c) shall expire upon salvaging of the vehicle or transfer of ownership. (g) Election.-- Upon application on a form prescribed by the department, the owner or lessee of a motor vehicle, except a motor vehicle registered under the International Registration Plan and a motor vehicle with a seasonal registration or a circus or carnival plate, may elect to pay an annual registration fee for a two-year period. The fee shall be two times the amount of the registration fee otherwise payable for the motor vehicle under this title.

(c) Customer billing.-- (1) Subject to the right of a retail gas customer to choose to receive separate bills from its natural gas supplier for natural gas supply service, the natural gas distribution company shall be responsible for billing each of its retail gas customers for natural gas distribution service, consistent with the orders or regulations of the commission, regardless of the identity of the provider of natural gas supply services. (2) (i) Bills to retail gas customers shall contain sufficient unbundled charge information to enable the customer to determine the basis for those charges and shall comply with section 1509 (relating to billing procedures). At a minimum, such charges shall include those services which are unbundled as a result of a restructuring filing or rulemaking. (ii) Bills to retail residential customers rendered by a natural gas distribution company for natural gas distribution services shall include information required by commission regulations governing standards and billing practices for residential utility service. (iii) Bills rendered by a natural gas distribution company on behalf of a natural gas supplier shall include, in a form and manner determined by the natural gas distribution company in consultation with the natural gas supplier, the following information with respect to natural gas supplier services: the name of the natural gas supplier; the rates, charges or prices of natural gas supply services billed, including adjustments to prior period billings, if applicable, and taxes, if applicable; and the natural gas supplier's toll-free telephone number and hours of operation for customer inquiries. (3) Incremental costs relating to billing services designed, implemented and rendered by the natural gas distribution company, at its election, on behalf of a natural gas supplier or other entity may be recovered through fees charged by the natural gas distribution company to the natural gas supplier or other entity. Either party may request that the commission consider the appropriate level of the fee. In doing so, the commission shall consider fees charged by other natural gas distribution companies for similar services. The commission shall either permit the fee to continue as set or shall establish an alternative mechanism to permit full recovery of unrecovered just and reasonable costs from the supplier or the supplier's customers. Nothing in this section shall permit the recovery of such costs from natural gas supply service customers of the natural gas distribution company. (4) If services are provided by an entity other than the natural gas distribution company, the entity that provided those services shall furnish to the natural gas distribution company billing data sufficient to enable the natural gas distribution company to timely bill retail gas customers. The entity shall provide data for billing purposes in a format and in a time frame as required by the natural gas distribution company. The natural gas distribution company shall consider the data and information confidential and shall treat it as such. (5) No natural gas distribution company shall be required to forward payment to entities providing services to customers and on whose behalf the natural gas distribution company is billing those customers before the natural gas distribution company has received payment for those services from customers. The commission shall issue guidelines addressing the application of partial payments. (6) Natural gas distribution companies and natural gas suppliers shall take reasonable steps to allow retail gas customers to contribute via their bill to hardship energy funds which benefit low-income residential retail gas consumers. (7) Natural gas distribution companies shall have the right to recover on a full and current basis all prudent and reasonable costs incurred to implement customer choice from retail natural gas customers or other entities as determined by the commission. Recovery from retail natural gas customers shall be made pursuant to a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments). (d) Enhanced metering.-- Subject to commission approval, the natural gas distribution company may require the installation, at the retail gas customer's expense, of enhanced metering capability sufficient to match the natural gas delivered by the retail gas customer's natural gas supplier or suppliers with consumption by that retail gas customer. In exercising its discretion, the commission shall consider the effect on low-income retail gas customers. (June 23, 2016, P.L.355, No.47, eff. 60 days) 2016 Amendment. Act 47 added subsec. (c)(7).",

(a) Quality.-- A natural gas distribution company shall be responsible for customer service functions consistent with the orders and regulations of the commission, including, but not limited to, meter reading, installation, testing and maintenance and emergency response for all customers, and complaint resolution and collections related to the service provided by the natural gas distribution company. Customer service and consumer protections and policies for retail gas customers shall, at a minimum, be maintained at the same level of quality under retail competition as in existence on the effective date of this chapter. (b) Change of suppliers.-- The commission shall, by order or regulation, establish procedures to ensure that a natural gas distribution company does not change a retail gas customer's natural gas supplier without direct oral confirmation from the customer of record or written evidence of the customer's consent to a change of supplier. (c) Customer information.-- The commission shall, by order or regulation, establish requirements that each natural gas distribution company and natural gas supplier provide adequate, accurate customer information to enable retail gas customers to make informed choices regarding the purchase of all natural gas services offered by that provider. Information shall be provided to retail gas customers in an understandable format that enables retail gas customers to compare prices and services on a uniform basis. (d) Consumer education.-- Prior to the implementation of any restructuring plan under section 2204 (relating to implementation), each natural gas distribution company, in conjunction with the commission and consistent with the guidelines established by the commission, shall implement a consumer education program to inform customers of the changes in the natural gas utility industry. The program shall provide retail gas customers with information necessary to help them make appropriate choices as to their natural gas service. The education program shall be subject to approval by the commission. The consumer education program shall include goals, objectives and an action plan that is designed to be objective, easily understood, utilizes a uniform measurement as established by the commission for the cost of gas, be available in languages that the commission requires to meet the needs of a service territory and be separate and distinct from marketing. (e) Consumer education cost recovery.-- The consumer education program shall be subject to approval by the commission and shall be funded in each natural gas distribution service territory by a nonbypassable, competitively neutral cost-recovery mechanism that fully recovers the reasonable cost of such program. To the extent that the industrial customer class is not currently assigned such costs on the effective date of this chapter, it shall not be assigned such costs in the future. (f) Tenants' rights.-- Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict the rights of tenants pursuant to Subchapter B of Chapter 15 (relating to discontinuance of service to leased premises).

      "text": "§ 2207. Obligation to serve. (a) Supplier of last resort.-- (1) After the effective date of this chapter, the natural gas distribution company shall serve as the supplier of last resort for residential, small commercial, small industrial and essential human needs customers and any other customer classes determined by the commission in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding until such time as the commission, pursuant to this section, approves an alternative supplier or suppliers to provide such services to any or all of the natural gas distribution company's customers. (2) For purposes of this section, a supplier of last resort is a natural gas distribution company or natural gas supplier which is designated by the commission to provide natural gas supply service with respect to one or more of the following services: (i) natural gas supply services to those customers who have not chosen an alternative natural gas supplier or who choose to be served by their supplier of last resort; (ii) natural gas supply services to those customers who are refused supply service from a natural gas supplier; or (iii) natural gas supply services to those customers whose natural gas supplier has failed to deliver its requirements. No customer shall have more than one supplier of last resort designated for any of the services set forth in this paragraph. (b) Consumer protection.-- Service by the supplier of last resort shall be subject to all consumer protection standards, including those contained in 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service) and to all universal service obligations. (c) Natural gas distribution company.-- The natural gas distribution company shall deliver natural gas to the extent that it is provided by all natural gas suppliers, or suppliers of last resort, as the case may be, in accordance with the natural gas distribution company's tariff. (d) Standards of service.-- Consistent with the standards set forth in section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities) and applicable orders of the commission, a supplier of last resort under subsection (a)(2)(iii) shall provide sufficient supplies as to quantity, quality, pressure and location to meet the operational reliability requirements of the natural gas distribution company's system, including, but not limited to, a failure of one or more natural gas suppliers to: (1) supply natural gas to their retail gas customers in conformance with their contractual obligations to such customers; or (2) satisfy applicable reliability standards and obligations. (e) Discontinuation of service.-- The natural gas distribution company shall continue providing services as the supplier of last resort to all of its customers for all of the natural gas supply services described in subsection (a)(2) unless, at its discretion, it requests and receives commission approval to discontinue providing one or more such supplier of last resort obligation. In approving such a petition, the commission shall also approve another party as the alternative supplier of last resort for each customer or customer group for which the natural gas distribution company no longer provides such natural gas supply services. (f) Regulations.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations setting forth the standards for approving an alternative supplier of last resort consistent with the provisions of this title, including a mechanism to ensure that the rates charged by any alternate supplier of last resort are just and reasonable. (g) Organized labor.-- During the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, approval of an alternative supplier of last resort pursuant to subsection (e) shall not be granted unless the entity designated by the commission to succeed the natural gas distribution company in the provision of service to these customers agrees to recognize relevant union and collective bargaining agreements of the natural gas distribution company then in place. (h) Petition to become supplier of last resort.-- After the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, any party may petition the commission to become the supplier of last resort to some or all customers except for those customers identified in subsection (a)(2)(i). (i) Notice required prior to market exit.-- (1) A natural gas supplier may not exit the market without providing notice as determined by the commission in the restructuring proceeding of the natural gas distribution company to its customers, the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company. (2) If firm gas supply contracts with Pennsylvania natural gas producers or storage or transportation capacity contracts used by the natural gas supplier to serve such retail gas customers were either assigned or released to the natural gas supplier or constitute capacity which was acquired by the natural gas supplier as the result of nonrenewal of a storage or transportation capacity contract previously held by the natural gas distribution company, the natural gas supplier shall offer the supplier of last resort or successor natural gas supplier a right of first refusal to utilize such Pennsylvania supply contracts or storage or transportation capacity contracts at its contract cost as long as needed to serve those customers. (3) If the storage or transportation capacity contracts held by the natural gas supplier were acquired in another manner, and there was not sufficient notice given to the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company, or if there is not alternative storage or transportation capacity available which is operationally sufficient to serve the market the natural gas supplier was serving, then the supplier of last resort shall be provided with a right to use such storage or transportation capacity as designated by the natural gas supplier, at the contract cost, until the supplier of last resort is able to acquire replacement capacity sufficient to serve its customers using reasonable and diligent efforts to do so. (4) If a dispute arises under this subsection, the aggrieved party may file a complaint with the commission for resolution within 45 days. (j) Duty involving lost customers.-- To the extent that a natural gas supplier loses retail gas customers such that its capacity requirements to a natural gas distribution company are reduced below the level established by the commission for such purpose in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, the natural gas supplier shall have the same obligations set forth in subsection (i). (k) Rate after service discontinued.-- In the event the natural gas supplier discontinues service or defaults before its contract with the customer expires, the retail gas customer shall be served by the supplier of last resort at the commission-approved supplier of last resort rate commencing with the next billing cycle. However, the retail gas customer shall continue to be charged the rate the customer negotiated with the discontinuing or defaulting natural gas supplier for the remainder of the billing cycle. Any difference between the cost incurred by the supplier of last resort and the amount payable by the retail gas customer shall be recovered from the natural gas supplier or from the bond or other security provided by the natural gas supplier without recourse to any retail gas customer not otherwise contractually committed for the difference.

The amount for each county to which funds will be distributed shall be determined using a formula that divides the number of spud unconventional gas wells in the county by the number of spud unconventional gas wells in this Commonwealth and multiplies the resulting percentage by the amount available for distribution under this paragraph. (2) Except as provided in section 2302(a.4), 37% shall be distributed to municipalities in which spud unconventional gas wells are located. The amount for each municipality to which funds will be distributed shall be determined using a formula that divides the number of spud unconventional gas wells in the municipality by the number of spud unconventional gas wells in this Commonwealth and multiplies the resulting percentage by the amount available for distribution under this paragraph. (3) Except as provided in section 2302(a.4), 27% shall be distributed to municipalities located in a county in which spud unconventional gas wells are located. The amount available for distribution in each county shall be determined by dividing the number of spud unconventional gas wells in the county by the number of spud unconventional gas wells in this Commonwealth and multiplying the resulting percentage by the amount available for distribution under this paragraph. The resulting amount available for distribution in each county in which spud unconventional gas wells are located shall be distributed to each municipality in the county to which funds will be distributed as follows: (i) Except as provided in section 2302(a.4), 50% of the amount available under this paragraph shall be distributed to municipalities in which spud unconventional gas wells are located and to municipalities that are either contiguous with a municipality in which spud unconventional gas wells are located or are located within five linear miles of a spud unconventional gas well.

(ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113 (relating to pedestrian-control signals), pedestrians facing any green signal may proceed across the roadway within a crosswalk. (2) Steady yellow indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green indication is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113, pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. (3) Steady red indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, or if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subparagraph (ii). (ii) Unless signing is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way highway onto a one-way highway after stopping as required by subparagraph (i). Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. (b) Places other than intersections.-- In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. (c) Inoperable or malfunctioning signal.-- If a traffic-control signal is out of operation or is not functioning properly, including, but not limited to, a signal that uses inductive loop sensors or other automated technology to detect the presence of vehicles that fails to detect a vehicle, vehicular traffic facing a: (1) Green or yellow signal may proceed with caution as indicated in subsection (a)(1) and (2).

This subsection does not apply to any convertible or withdrawable real estate in which no unit has been conveyed. (b) Other liens.-- Before conveying real estate to the association, the declarant shall have the real estate released from: (1) All liens, the foreclosure of which would deprive unit owners of any right of access to or easements of support of their units.

      "text": "§ 3410. Condominiums containing conversion buildings. (a) Notice of conversion.-- The declarant of every condominium containing one or more conversion buildings shall give each of the residential tenants and residential subtenants, if any, lawfully in possession of a unit or units in a conversion building or buildings, a conversion notice no later than one year before the declarant will require such residential tenant and residential subtenant to vacate. The conversion notice must set forth generally the rights of residential tenants and residential subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States certified or registered mail return receipt requested to the residential tenant and residential subtenant at the address of the unit and not more than one other mailing address provided by a residential tenant. Every notice shall be accompanied by a public offering statement concerning the proposed sale of condominium units within such building or buildings. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), no residential tenant or residential subtenant in a conversion building may be required by the declarant to vacate the unit he leases earlier than one year after the conversion notice date, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises and the terms of the tenancy, including those terms that apply to a period occurring in whole or in part after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during that period. Failure of a declarant to give notice to a residential tenant or residential subtenant entitled to such notice pursuant to this subsection is a defense to an action for possession against such residential tenant or residential subtenant. (b) Offer to tenant to purchase unit.-- For six months after the conversion notice date, the declarant shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use in a conversion building to the tenant who leases that unit. If the tenant fails to purchase his unit during that six-month period, the declarant may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following six months at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection shall not apply to any rental unit which immediately prior to the conversion notice date was restricted or devoted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of which unit, after the creation of the condominium, will not substantially conform to the boundaries of such unit on the conversion notice date. (c) Effect of wrongful conveyance.-- If a declarant, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, recordation of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that unit if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection (b) but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of subsection (b). (d) Notice to vacate.-- If a conversion notice specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, the conversion notice also constitutes a notice of termination of the tenant's lease, subject to revocation in accordance with subsection (i), and a notice to quit specified by section 501 of the act of April 6, 1951 (P.L.69, No.20), known as The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951. (e) Improper lease termination prohibited.-- (1) Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms. (2) Nothing in this section or in any lease shall prohibit a residential tenant, after receiving notice pursuant to subsection (a), from terminating any lease without any liability for such termination provided such tenant gives the building owner 90 days' written notice of the intent to terminate the lease. (3) The declarant or owner of any proposed conversion condominium shall not engage in any activity of any nature which would coerce the tenant into terminating any lease, including but not limited to stampeding, harassing tenants or withholding normal services or repairs. (f) Units leased to senior citizens and disabled persons.-- (1) For the purpose of this subsection, an eligible tenant or subtenant shall be a natural person who, on the conversion notice date, lawfully occupies a unit in a conversion building as his principal residence and is 62 years of age or older or is disabled, and has occupied the unit for at least two years. For the purpose of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to be \"disabled\" if on the conversion notice date he is totally and permanently unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impediment, including, but not limited to, blindness. (2) Within 60 days after the conversion notice date, any tenant, or subtenant, in possession of a unit, who believes that he is an eligible tenant or subtenant shall so notify the declarant and shall provide the declarant with proof of his eligibility. Any eligible tenant or subtenant who has established his eligibility as aforesaid shall be entitled to remain in possession of his unit for two years following the conversion notice date, notwithstanding any prior termination date in his lease, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste or conduct that disturbs other occupants' peaceful enjoyment of the condominium, and the terms of the tenancy, including terms that apply to a time period after the conversion notice date, may not be altered, but may be enforced, during the time period between the original lease termination date and the expiration of this two-year period except as is otherwise provided in paragraph (3). (3) The monthly rental payable by the tenant during the time period commencing upon the later to occur of the original lease termination date or the first anniversary of the conversion notice date and ending upon the expiration of the two-year period described in paragraph (2) shall be the same monthly rental as was payable for the month immediately preceding the original lease termination date, except that, at the landlord's option, such monthly rental may be increased by the lesser of 5% of such monthly rental or the same percentage increase as the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor for the six-month time period commencing on the first day of the first full calendar month after the conversion notice date. (4) Failure of a declarant to comply with the provisions of this subsection is a defense to an action for possession. (g) Tenant meetings; open to the public.-- With respect to any conversion building containing one or more units then occupied for residential use, at least 30 days before the conversion notice date, the declarant shall hold a tenant meeting open to the public in the municipality where the proposed conversion building is located at a place and time convenient to the persons who may be directly affected by the conversion. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be given to residential tenants and subtenants in lawful possession of their units in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice and to the general public by a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the condominium is located, except that no notice to the general public need be given with respect to conversion buildings as to which the provisions of section 3402(b) (relating to public offering statement; general provisions) are applicable. At such meeting, representatives of the declarant shall briefly describe the following and may, but shall not be required to, discuss other matters: (1) The rights and obligations of tenants and subtenants pursuant to this section. (2) Improvements, if any, then planned to be made to the condominium by the declarant. (3) The anticipated approximate range of initial unit sales prices. Specific unit sales prices need not, however, be provided. (4) The anticipated approximate range of estimated monthly common expenses for various types of units, however, specific per unit estimates need not be provided. (h) Community development grants.-- If Federal funds under Title I of the Community Development Act of 1974 have been used to finance the rehabilitation of multifamily rental housing, with the intent that such housing subsequent to the rehabilitation is to be used for residential rental purposes, such housing shall not be converted to a condominium for a period of ten years from the date the rehabilitation is completed. (i) Revocation.-- A declarant may subsequently revoke a conversion notice if the declarant has expressly reserved the right of revocation in the conversion notice and if the notice of revocation: (1) is given prior to the conveyance of any unit in the condominium occurring after the conversion notice date other than a unit or units conveyed to a successor declarant or as a result of foreclosure of a mortgage on the unit or a deed in lieu thereof; (2) is given in the same manner as is required for the giving of the conversion notice; and (3) is given to all persons who were entitled to receive the conversion notice and who continue to be in lawful occupancy at the time such notice of revocation is given. The giving of a notice of revocation revokes all rights granted under this section, but does not revoke the rights granted to residential tenants under subsection (a) or (f), and such rights shall be deemed to have been incorporated in each residential tenant's lease. (j) Waiver of purchase rights.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of this subpart prohibiting waiver of rights, any tenant may waive his right to purchase a unit pursuant to subsection (b) if the waiver is in writing, is acknowledged and is given in consideration of: (1) an extension of the term of the tenant's tenancy and right of occupancy under this subpart beyond the time period required by subsection (a) or (f) as applicable; (2) the tenant entering into an agreement to purchase another unit in the condominium; or (3) all occupants of the unit making alternative living arrangements. (k) Alteration of terms of tenancy.-- Notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (a) or (f), the terms of the tenancy of a tenant or subtenant may be altered with the express written consent of that tenant or subtenant, and such altered terms shall then be the terms of tenancy referred to in this section. (l) Application of section.-- The provisions of this section shall apply only with respect to conversion buildings in which one or more residential tenants or residential subtenants are in lawful occupancy on the conversion notice date and the only tenants who are entitled to exercise the rights granted under this section are residential tenants or residential subtenants: (1) who are in lawful occupancy of conversion building on the date the declarant gives the conversion notice; or (2) who commence their tenancy after the notice of conversion is given to the other residential tenants without having been notified in writing, at or prior to the commencement of their tenancy, that the property is then a condominium and that they are not entitled to the rights granted under this section. Such rights continue only so long as the lawful occupancy of the tenant or subtenant continues.

In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.

(a) General rule.-- A customer or collecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that: (1) the warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the item; (2) all signatures on the item are authentic and authorized; (3) the item has not been altered; (4) the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment (section 3305(a)) of any party that can be asserted against the warrantor; and (5) the warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer. (b) Effect of dishonor.-- If an item is dishonored, a customer or collecting bank transferring the item and receiving settlement or other consideration is obliged to pay the amount due on the item according to the terms of the item at the time it was transferred or, if the transfer was of an incomplete item, according to its terms when completed as stated in sections 3115 (relating to incomplete instrument) and 3407 (relating to alteration). The obligation of a transferor is owed to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that takes the item in good faith. A transferor cannot disclaim its obligation under this subsection by an indorsement stating that it is made \"without recourse\" or otherwise disclaiming liability. (c) Measure of damages for breach of warranty.-- A person to whom the warranties under subsection (a) are made and who took the item in good faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result of the breach, but not more than the amount of the item plus expenses and loss of interest incurred as a result of the breach. (d) Prohibition against certain disclaimers and discharge.-- The warranties stated in subsection (a) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim. (e) Cause of action.-- A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach. (July 9, 1992, P.L.507, No.97, eff. one year)",

(a) General rule.-- To exercise any development right reserved under section 4205(a)(8) (relating to contents of declaration), the declarant shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration (section 4216). If the exercise of such development rights causes real estate to be added to a cooperative or withdrawn from a cooperative, the amendment to the declaration shall either convey or refer to the instrument conveying the real estate so added or withdrawn and shall contain a legally sufficient description of the real estate.

(2) If the declarant subdivides the unit into two or more units, whether or not any part of the unit is converted into common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the cooperative interests created by the subdivision in any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant. (d) Withdrawal of real estate.-- If the declaration provides, pursuant to section 4205(a)(8), that all or a portion of the real estate is subject to the development right of withdrawal: (1) If all of the real estate is subject to withdrawal and the declaration does not describe separate portions of real estate subject to that right, none of the real estate may be withdrawn after a cooperative interest has been conveyed to a purchaser. (2) If a portion or portions are subject to withdrawal, no portion may be withdrawn after a cooperative interest in the portion has been conveyed to a purchaser. Cross References.

(a) Duty of police.-- Every police officer having knowledge of a vehicle on which the vehicle identification number has been removed or falsified shall immediately seize and take possession of the vehicle and arrest or file a complaint for the arrest of the suspected owner or custodian. In all actions involving seizure or possession of such vehicles, vehicle identification information shall be transmitted to the Federal or other agencies involved in recovery of stolen vehicles. (b) Proceedings if owner known.-- The court, upon petition of the owner or of the person entitled to possession of a seized vehicle, may relinquish custody of the vehicle to the person legally entitled to the vehicle. Any vehicle in the possession or custody of a police officer shall not be released to the owner or person legally entitled to possession of a seized vehicle pursuant to this section until such time as a replacement vehicle identification number plate has been obtained. Proof of the replacement vehicle identification number must be exhibited to the police officer at the time of release, together with the court order relinquishing custody. The provisions with regard to the securance of a replacement vehicle identification number shall not apply when the vehicle is titled in a foreign state and will be removed from this State immediately upon release. If the foreign vehicle will not be removed immediately, the exception does not apply and a replacement vehicle identification number must be obtained. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the court shall retain in custody the seized vehicle pending prosecution of the person arrested. In case the person is found guilty, the vehicle shall remain in the custody of the court until the fine and costs of prosecution are paid, except that if 90 days have elapsed after the verdict has been rendered and the fine and costs have not been paid, the court shall proceed to advertise and sell the vehicle in the manner provided by law for the sale of personal property under execution. The proceeds from the sale shall be used to pay the fine and costs of prosecution and the balance, if any, shall be forwarded to the department to be transmitted to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Motor License Fund.

(2) If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, an order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls and must be so recognized, but, if an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls and must be so recognized. (3) If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this part, the tribunal of this State shall issue a child support order, which controls. (a.2) Request to determine controlling order.-- If two or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and the same child, upon request of a party who is an individual or which is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this State having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under subsection (a.1). The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification under Chapter 76 (relating to registration, enforcement and modification of support order) or may be filed as a separate proceeding. The request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child support order in effect and the applicable record of payments. The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination. (b) Exclusive jurisdiction.-- The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection (a), (a.1) or (a.2) is the tribunal that has continuing jurisdiction under section 7205 (relating to continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify child support orders) or 7206 (relating to continuing jurisdiction to enforce child support orders). (c) Basis of order.-- A tribunal of this State which determines by order the identity of the controlling order under subsection (a.1)(1) or (2) or (a.2) or which issues a new controlling order under subsection (a.1)(3) shall state all of the following in that order: (1) The basis upon which the tribunal made its determination. (2) The amount of prospective support, if any. (3) The total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are credited under section 7209 (relating to credit for payments). (d) Filing of copy of order.-- Within 30 days after issuance of an order determining the identity of the controlling order, the party obtaining the determining order shall file a certified copy of it with each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement agency that obtains a determining order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. Failure to file a copy of the determining order does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order. (e) Recognition.-- An order which has been determined to be the controlling order or a judgment for consolidated arrears of support and interest, if any, made under this section must be recognized in proceedings under this part.

(2) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are less than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, each maintenance district's share shall be reduced, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocation within the funding limits, in the same proportion that each county's base allocations bears to the combined total of all counties' base allocations. (3) For any fiscal year in which the total highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations are greater than the combined total base allocations of all the county maintenance districts, the funds shall be distributed based upon the formula in subsection (b), but notwithstanding the formula calculation for any particular county, no county shall receive less than its base allocation in any year. (b) Formula for distribution.-- The department shall distribute to each county maintenance district: (1) an amount equal to the county's base allocation; plus (2) an amount based on the following incremental formula in which each county shall receive a portion of State highway maintenance appropriations and executive authorizations in excess of the total of all counties' base allocations, expressed in the following manner: ASHMA (40% RPQc + 15% BMDc + 30% LMc + 15% VMc). (c) Establishment of applicable data.-- The applicable data for all counties corresponding to each individual factor in the incremental formula in subsection (b) shall be established and certified by the Governor by May 1 of each year based on the best information available at that time for the immediately preceding five-year period with the exception of BMD. The submission of data relative to BMD shall only include the immediately preceding 12-month period beginning with fiscal year 1997-1998. In each subsequent fiscal year, an additional year of data relative to BMD shall be added until such time as data from a five-year period has been accumulated. (d) Effect of insufficient funds.-- In the event sufficient funds are not available to fully fund all county maintenance districts under the formula in subsection (b) due to the hold harmless provision in subsection (a), each county maintenance district receiving an increase above its base allocation shall have its share reduced in the proportion that the increase over its base allocation bears to the total increases over the base allocation of all counties entitled to an increase, to the extent necessary to bring the total allocations within the funding limit.

A public entity may establish procedures for the distribution of a request for proposals, including the imposition of a fee to reimburse the public entity for the costs of photocopying and mailing. (e) Receipt of proposals.-- Offerors shall submit their proposals to ensure that their proposals are received prior to the time and date established for receipt of the proposals. Proposals shall be submitted in the format required by the request for proposals. Proposals shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of their contents to competing offerors. (f) Evaluation.-- A public entity shall evaluate each proposal to determine which proposal has the best value for and is in the best interest of the public entity. In making this determination, a public entity may consider any of the following: (1) Cost. (2) Price. (3) Financial commitment. (4) Innovative financing. (5) Bonding. (6) Technical, scientific, technological or socioeconomic merit. (7) Financial strength and viability. (8) Design, operation and feasibility of the transportation project.

No individual who has been employed by an offeror within the last two years may participate in the evaluation of proposals. (i) Discussion with responsible offerors and revision of proposals.-- As provided in the request for proposals, discussions and negotiations may be conducted with responsible offerors for the purpose of clarification and of obtaining best and final offers. Responsible offers shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. (j) Selection for negotiation.-- The responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the best value for and in the best interests of the public entity, taking into consideration all evaluation factors, shall be selected for contract negotiation. (k) Cancellation.-- A request for proposals may be canceled at any time prior to the time a public-private transportation partnership agreement is executed by all parties when it is in the best interests of the public entity. (l) Award.-- Upon reaching an agreement with a responsible offeror, a public entity shall enter into a public-private transportation partnership agreement with the responsible offeror. The public-private transportation partnership agreement shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter. If agreement cannot be reached with the best qualified responsible offeror, then negotiations will be formally terminated with the offeror. If proposals were submitted by one or more other responsible offerors, negotiations may be conducted with the other responsible offeror or responsible offerors in the order of their respective qualification ranking. The contract may be awarded to the responsible offeror then ranked as best qualified. (m) Resolution of controversies involving the Commonwealth.-- If a prospective offeror, offeror or development entity is aggrieved by a selection under this section and the public entity or proprietary public entity in the invitation or contract is a Commonwealth agency, the prospective offeror, offeror or development entity may file a protest or a claim, as appropriate, in accordance with 62 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17 (relating to legal and contractual remedies). (n) Resolution of controversies not involving the Commonwealth.-- If a development entity is aggrieved by a selection under this section and the proprietary public entity in the contract is an entity other than the Commonwealth, a development entity may file a claim with the court of common pleas where the proprietary public entity is located. The process for the filing and resolution of claims, including rights, contents, timing, evaluation, determination and remedies, which are established in 62 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17, shall apply insofar as they are practicable. (July 11, 2022, P.L.1566, No.84, eff. imd.) 2022 Amendment. Act 84 amended subsec. (a). Cross References.

(a) General priority rules.-- Except as otherwise provided in this section, priority among conflicting security interests and agricultural liens in the same collateral is determined according to the following rules: (1) Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection. (2) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien. (3) The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected. (b) Time of perfection: proceeds and supporting obligations.-- For the purposes of subsection (a)(1): (1) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and (2) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation. (c) Special priority rules: proceeds and supporting obligations.-- Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a security interest in collateral which qualifies for priority over a conflicting security interest under section 9327 (relating to priority of security interests in deposit account), 9328 (relating to priority of security interests in investment property), 9329 (relating to priority of security interests in letter-of-credit right), 9330 (relating to priority of purchaser of chattel paper or instrument) or 9331 (relating to priority of rights of purchasers of controllable accounts, controllable electronic records, controllable payment intangibles, documents, instruments and securities under other divisions; priority of interests in financial assets and security entitlements and protection against assertion of claim under Divisions 8 and 12) also has priority over a conflicting security interest in all of the following: (1) Any supporting obligation for the collateral. (2) Proceeds of the collateral if: (i) the security interest in proceeds is perfected; (ii) the proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and (iii) in the case of proceeds which are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are: (A) cash proceeds; (B) proceeds of the same type as the collateral; or (C) an account relating to the collateral. (d) First-to-file priority rule for certain collateral.-- Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), if a security interest in chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests in proceeds of the collateral rank according to priority in time of filing. (e) Applicability of subsection (d).-- Subsection (d) applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property or letter-of-credit rights. (f) Limitations on subsections (a) through (e).-- Subsections (a) through (e) are subject to: (1) subsection (g) and the other provisions of this chapter; (2) section 4210 (relating to security interest of collecting bank in items, accompanying documents and proceeds); (3) section 5118 (relating to security interest of issuer or nominated person); and (4) section 9110 (relating to security interests arising under Division 2 or 2A).

The appointment shall occur no later than 30 days after the receipt of the application. (2) The panel shall appoint as independent counsel an individual who has appropriate experience and who will conduct the investigation and any prosecution in a prompt, responsible and cost-effective manner. The panel shall seek to appoint as independent counsel an individual who will serve to the extent necessary to complete the investigation and any prosecution without undue delay. The panel may not appoint as an independent counsel any person who holds any office of profit or trust with the Commonwealth. A person who is serving as a special investigative counsel may not be appointed or serve as an independent counsel in the matter for which the person had been appointed to investigate as special investigative counsel. If an independent counsel is appointed, the independent counsel may only accept the appointment when the appointment would not conflict with the rules governing professional conduct. (3) In defining the independent counsel's prosecutorial jurisdiction, the panel shall assure that the independent counsel has adequate authority to fully investigate and prosecute the subject matter with respect to which the special investigative counsel has requested the appointment of the independent counsel and all matters related to that subject matter. Jurisdiction shall also include the authority to investigate and prosecute an offense classified higher than a summary offense or a contempt of court which may arise out of the investigation with respect to which the special investigative counsel's request was made. (4) The panel shall disclose the identity of the independent counsel upon appointment. (b) Expansion of jurisdiction.-- (1) The panel upon the request of a district attorney or a requesting judge may expand the prosecutorial jurisdiction of an independent counsel.

(2) If the independent counsel discovers or receives information about possible violations of criminal law by persons as provided in section 9512 (relating to preliminary investigation) which are not covered by the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel, the independent counsel may submit the information to a district attorney. In accordance with this subchapter, a district attorney shall petition the panel to appoint a special investigative counsel to conduct a preliminary investigation of the information, except that the preliminary investigation shall not exceed 30 days from the date the information is received. In making the determinations required by this subchapter, the special investigative counsel shall give great weight to any recommendations of the independent counsel. (3) If the special investigative counsel determines, after according great weight to the recommendations of the independent counsel, that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted, the special investigative counsel shall promptly notify the panel. (4) The panel shall expand the jurisdiction of the appropriate independent counsel to include the matters involved or shall appoint another independent counsel to investigate the matters if: (i) the special investigative counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted; or (ii) the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (2) elapses without a notification to the panel that no further investigation is warranted. (5) If the independent counsel discovers or receives information about possible violations of criminal law by persons other than those provided for in section 9512 and which are not covered by the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel and a request for expansion under this subsection has not been made by a district attorney or a requesting judge or the request for expansion under this subsection has been denied by the panel, the independent counsel shall submit the information to the appropriate law enforcement authority. (c) Return for further explanation.-- Upon receipt of a notification under this subchapter that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted with respect to information received under this chapter, the panel shall have no authority to overrule this determination but may return the matter to the special investigative counsel for further explanation of the reasons for the determination. (d) Vacancies.-- If a vacancy in office arises by reason of the resignation, death or removal of an independent counsel, the panel shall appoint an independent counsel to complete the work of the independent counsel whose resignation, death or removal caused the vacancy, except that, in the case of a vacancy arising by reason of the removal of an independent counsel, the panel may appoint an acting independent counsel to serve until any judicial review of the removal is completed.",

(2) If the secured party's compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was conducted in accordance with this chapter.

(4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(ii), the amount of proceeds which would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses and attorney fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum. (5) If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under section 9615(f) (relating to calculation of surplus or deficiency in disposition to person related to secured party), the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices which a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party or a secondary obligor would have brought. (b) Nonconsumer transactions; no inference.-- The limitation of the rules in subsection (a) to transactions other than consumer transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer transactions.

(a) Findings.-- The General Assembly hereby finds that imposition of a tax on oil company revenues should provide the Department of Transportation with an annual growth in revenues which offsets the growth in highway maintenance and construction costs more effectively than the annual changes in revenues produced by the flat-rate tax on the retail price of gasoline and by the various other taxes and fees levied on behalf of the department. As a result of such a tax on oil company revenues, the Department of Transportation should have sufficient revenues to carry out necessary maintenance and construction activities with less frequent increases in highway taxes and fees than the General Assembly has enacted in recent years. One effect of less frequent requests for highway tax and fee increases could be a significant decrease in the ability of the General Assembly to oversee the activities of the Department of Transportation. Accordingly, the General Assembly finds that responsible legislative oversight requires ongoing monitoring of the department's activities and periodic indepth evaluations of its performance. (b) Annual reports.-- No later than 30 days after the effective date of this section, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the 1981-1982 fiscal year. No later than 30 days before the beginning of the 1982-1983 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the maintenance and construction program planned for that member's district during the upcoming fiscal year. No later than 30 days after the end of the 1981-1982 fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year, the department shall, upon request, provide to any member of the House of Representatives and to any member of the Senate a brief outline of the reasons for any major deviations from the maintenance and construction program which had been planned for that member's district during that fiscal year. (c) Performance audits.-- During the 1983-1984 fiscal year, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, a performance audit of the department carried out in accordance with the standards for performance and financial compliance auditing developed by the United States General Accounting Office. The performance audit shall determine whether the department is conducting authorized activities or programs in a manner consistent with accomplishing the objectives intended by the General Assembly and is conducting programs or activities and expending available funds in a faithful, efficient, economical and effective manner. The Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall make a written report of the findings of the performance audit and shall submit a copy of that report to each member of the House of Representatives and each member of the Senate prior to enactment of a maintenance and construction budget for the department for the 1984-1985 fiscal year. During the 1989-1990 fiscal year and every six years thereafter, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, a performance audit of the department similar to the performance audit required by this subsection to be conducted during the 1983-1984 fiscal year.",

(d) Continuation statement.-- (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (2), the filing of a continuation statement after Revised Division 9 takes effect does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before Revised Division 9 takes effect. (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after Revised Division 9 takes effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Chapter 93 of Revised Division 9 (relating to perfection and priority), the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before Revised Division 9 takes effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.

      "text": "§ 2207. Obligation to serve. (a) Supplier of last resort.-- (1) After the effective date of this chapter, the natural gas distribution company shall serve as the supplier of last resort for residential, small commercial, small industrial and essential human needs customers and any other customer classes determined by the commission in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding until such time as the commission, pursuant to this section, approves an alternative supplier or suppliers to provide such services to any or all of the natural gas distribution company's customers. (2) For purposes of this section, a supplier of last resort is a natural gas distribution company or natural gas supplier which is designated by the commission to provide natural gas supply service with respect to one or more of the following services: (i) natural gas supply services to those customers who have not chosen an alternative natural gas supplier or who choose to be served by their supplier of last resort; (ii) natural gas supply services to those customers who are refused supply service from a natural gas supplier; or (iii) natural gas supply services to those customers whose natural gas supplier has failed to deliver its requirements. No customer shall have more than one supplier of last resort designated for any of the services set forth in this paragraph. (b) Consumer protection.-- Service by the supplier of last resort shall be subject to all consumer protection standards, including those contained in 52 Pa. Code Ch. 56 (relating to standards and billing practices for residential utility service) and to all universal service obligations. (c) Natural gas distribution company.-- The natural gas distribution company shall deliver natural gas to the extent that it is provided by all natural gas suppliers, or suppliers of last resort, as the case may be, in accordance with the natural gas distribution company's tariff. (d) Standards of service.-- Consistent with the standards set forth in section 1501 (relating to character of service and facilities) and applicable orders of the commission, a supplier of last resort under subsection (a)(2)(iii) shall provide sufficient supplies as to quantity, quality, pressure and location to meet the operational reliability requirements of the natural gas distribution company's system, including, but not limited to, a failure of one or more natural gas suppliers to: (1) supply natural gas to their retail gas customers in conformance with their contractual obligations to such customers; or (2) satisfy applicable reliability standards and obligations. (e) Discontinuation of service.-- The natural gas distribution company shall continue providing services as the supplier of last resort to all of its customers for all of the natural gas supply services described in subsection (a)(2) unless, at its discretion, it requests and receives commission approval to discontinue providing one or more such supplier of last resort obligation. In approving such a petition, the commission shall also approve another party as the alternative supplier of last resort for each customer or customer group for which the natural gas distribution company no longer provides such natural gas supply services. (f) Regulations.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations setting forth the standards for approving an alternative supplier of last resort consistent with the provisions of this title, including a mechanism to ensure that the rates charged by any alternate supplier of last resort are just and reasonable. (g) Organized labor.-- During the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, approval of an alternative supplier of last resort pursuant to subsection (e) shall not be granted unless the entity designated by the commission to succeed the natural gas distribution company in the provision of service to these customers agrees to recognize relevant union and collective bargaining agreements of the natural gas distribution company then in place. (h) Petition to become supplier of last resort.-- After the five-year period following the effective date of this chapter, any party may petition the commission to become the supplier of last resort to some or all customers except for those customers identified in subsection (a)(2)(i). (i) Notice required prior to market exit.-- (1) A natural gas supplier may not exit the market without providing notice as determined by the commission in the restructuring proceeding of the natural gas distribution company to its customers, the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company. (2) If firm gas supply contracts with Pennsylvania natural gas producers or storage or transportation capacity contracts used by the natural gas supplier to serve such retail gas customers were either assigned or released to the natural gas supplier or constitute capacity which was acquired by the natural gas supplier as the result of nonrenewal of a storage or transportation capacity contract previously held by the natural gas distribution company, the natural gas supplier shall offer the supplier of last resort or successor natural gas supplier a right of first refusal to utilize such Pennsylvania supply contracts or storage or transportation capacity contracts at its contract cost as long as needed to serve those customers. (3) If the storage or transportation capacity contracts held by the natural gas supplier were acquired in another manner, and there was not sufficient notice given to the supplier of last resort and the natural gas distribution company, or if there is not alternative storage or transportation capacity available which is operationally sufficient to serve the market the natural gas supplier was serving, then the supplier of last resort shall be provided with a right to use such storage or transportation capacity as designated by the natural gas supplier, at the contract cost, until the supplier of last resort is able to acquire replacement capacity sufficient to serve its customers using reasonable and diligent efforts to do so. (4) If a dispute arises under this subsection, the aggrieved party may file a complaint with the commission for resolution within 45 days. (j) Duty involving lost customers.-- To the extent that a natural gas supplier loses retail gas customers such that its capacity requirements to a natural gas distribution company are reduced below the level established by the commission for such purpose in the natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, the natural gas supplier shall have the same obligations set forth in subsection (i). (k) Rate after service discontinued.-- In the event the natural gas supplier discontinues service or defaults before its contract with the customer expires, the retail gas customer shall be served by the supplier of last resort at the commission-approved supplier of last resort rate commencing with the next billing cycle. However, the retail gas customer shall continue to be charged the rate the customer negotiated with the discontinuing or defaulting natural gas supplier for the remainder of the billing cycle. Any difference between the cost incurred by the supplier of last resort and the amount payable by the retail gas customer shall be recovered from the natural gas supplier or from the bond or other security provided by the natural gas supplier without recourse to any retail gas customer not otherwise contractually committed for the difference.

(f) Conduct of investigations.-- (1) The commission may require a natural gas supplier to provide information, including documents and testimony, in accordance with the commission's regulations regarding the discovery of information. (2) Material which the commission determines to be confidential, proprietary or trade secret information provided under this subsection shall not be disclosed to any person not directly employed or retained by the commission to conduct the investigation without the consent of the party providing the information.

The commission may disclose the information to appropriate Federal or State law enforcement officials if it determines that the disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent or restrain a violation of Federal or State law and it provides the party that provided the information with reasonable notice and opportunity to prevent or limit disclosure. (g) Referrals and investigation.-- If, as a result of the investigation conducted under this section, the commission has reason to believe that anticompetitive or discriminatory conduct, including the unlawful exercise of market power, is preventing the retail gas customers from obtaining the benefits of a properly functioning and effectively competitive retail natural gas market, the commission, pursuant to its regulations, shall: (1) Refer its findings to the Attorney General, the United States Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. (2) Subject to subsection (c)(3), disclose any information it has obtained in the course of its investigation to the agency or agencies to which it had made a referral under paragraph (1). (3) Intervene, as provided and permitted by law or regulation, in any proceedings initiated as a result of a referral made under paragraph (1). (h) Marketing standards.-- As part of each natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding, the commission may, in its discretion, develop and apply different standards of conduct to the natural gas distribution company's marketing activities related to natural gas supply services. No such standards shall apply to the natural gas distribution company's marketing division or operations until the commission issues an order in the context of that natural gas distribution company's restructuring proceeding. (i) Definition.-- Subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (h), for the purposes of this section, the term \"affiliated natural gas supplier\" includes marketing activities related to natural gas supply services by the marketing division or the marketing operation of a natural gas distribution company.",

(a) Statement of warranties.-- If an unaccepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee pays or accepts the draft, the person obtaining payment or acceptance, at the time of presentment, and a previous transferor of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant to the drawee making payment or accepting the draft in good faith that: (1) the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the draft, a person entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the draft; (2) the draft has not been altered; and (3) the warrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer of the draft is unauthorized. (b) Damages for breach of warranty.-- A drawee making payment may recover from any warrantor damages for breach of warranty equal to the amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer because of the payment. In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment. If the drawee accepts the draft, breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor. If the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this subsection. (c) Defense.-- If a drawee asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection (a) based on an unauthorized indorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the indorsement is effective under section 3404 (relating to impostors; fictitious payees) or 3405 (relating to employer's responsibility for fraudulent indorsement by employee) or the drawer is precluded under section 3406 (relating to negligence contributing to forged signature or alteration of instrument) or 4406 (relating to duty of customer to discover and report unauthorized signature or alteration) from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized indorsement or alteration. (d) Statement of warranty in certain other cases.-- If a dishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an indorser or any other instrument is presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the instrument and payment is received, the following rules apply: (1) The person obtaining payment and a prior transferor of the instrument warrant to the person making payment in good faith that the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the instrument, a person entitled to enforce the instrument or authorized to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the instrument. (2) The person making payment may recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal to the amount paid plus expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.

Rights of the drawee under this subsection are not affected by failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in paying or accepting the draft.

The obligation of an accommodation party may be enforced notwithstanding any statute of frauds and whether or not the accommodation party receives consideration for the accommodation. (c) Presumption.-- A person signing an instrument is presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the instrument is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous indorsement or is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party to the instrument. Except as provided in section 3605 (relating to discharge of indorsers and accommodation parties), the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation. (d) Limitation on liability.-- If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument only if: (1) execution of judgment against the other party has been returned unsatisfied; (2) the other party is insolvent or in an insolvency proceeding; (3) the other party cannot be served with process; or (4) it is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from the other party. (e) Rights between accommodation and accommodated parties.-- An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against the accommodated party. An accommodated party who pays the instrument has no right of recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party. Cross References.

An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a copayee. (b) Measure of damages.-- In an action under subsection (a), the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument. (c) Limitation on liability.-- A representative, other than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.

(c) Reallocation of interests if number of units reduced.-- If the expiration or termination of a lease decreases the number of units in a cooperative, the allocated interests shall be reallocated in accordance with section 4107(a) (relating to eminent domain) as though those units had been taken by eminent domain.

(a) General rule.-- To exercise any development right reserved under section 4205(a)(8) (relating to contents of declaration), the declarant shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration (section 4216). If the exercise of such development rights causes real estate to be added to a cooperative or withdrawn from a cooperative, the amendment to the declaration shall either convey or refer to the instrument conveying the real estate so added or withdrawn and shall contain a legally sufficient description of the real estate. The amendment to the declaration must also assign an identifying number to each new unit created, if appropriate, and reallocate the allocated interests among all cooperative interests. The amendment must also describe any common elements and any limited common elements thereby created and, in the case of limited common elements, designate the unit to which each is allocated to the extent required by section 4208 (relating to limited common elements). (b) Reservation of development rights.-- Development rights may be reserved within any real estate added to the cooperative if the amendment adding that real estate includes all matters required by section 4205 or 4206 (relating to leasehold cooperatives), as the case may be. This provision does not extend the time limit on the exercise of development rights imposed by the declaration pursuant to section 4205(b)(1). (c) Subdivision or conversion of unit.-- Whenever a declarant exercises a development right to subdivide or convert a unit previously created into additional units, common elements or both: (1) If the declarant converts the unit entirely to common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the cooperative interest of which that unit is a part among the other cooperative interests as if that unit had been taken by eminent domain (section 4107). (2) If the declarant subdivides the unit into two or more units, whether or not any part of the unit is converted into common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of the cooperative interests created by the subdivision in any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant. (d) Withdrawal of real estate.-- If the declaration provides, pursuant to section 4205(a)(8), that all or a portion of the real estate is subject to the development right of withdrawal: (1) If all of the real estate is subject to withdrawal and the declaration does not describe separate portions of real estate subject to that right, none of the real estate may be withdrawn after a cooperative interest has been conveyed to a purchaser. (2) If a portion or portions are subject to withdrawal, no portion may be withdrawn after a cooperative interest in the portion has been conveyed to a purchaser. Cross References.

The Emergency Management Assistance Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: Article I Purpose and Authorities This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this compact, the term \"states\" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and all U.S. territorial possessions. The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack. This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states. Article II General Implementation Each party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist. The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood. On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact. Article III Party State Responsibilities A. It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall: 1. review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resources shortages, civil disorders, insurgency or enemy attack; 2. review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency; 3. develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans; 4. assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries; 5. protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material; 6. inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness; and 7. provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities. B. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance to another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this compact shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information: 1. a description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, including, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building, inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue; 2. the amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed; and 3. the specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location. C. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities. Article IV Limitations Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer. Article V Licenses and Permits Whenever any person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise. Article VI Liability Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes. No party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness. Article VII Supplementary Agreements Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein shall preclude any state entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies. Article VIII Compensation Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state. Article IX Reimbursement Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense or other cost or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this article. Article X Evacuation Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees. Article XI Implementation A. This compact shall become effective immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon enactment by such state. B. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until 30 days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. C. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States Government. Article XII Validity This compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected. Article XIII Additional Provisions Nothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into Federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under section 1385 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

(a) Appointment and jurisdiction of independent counsel.-- (1) Upon receipt of an application, the panel shall appoint an appropriate independent counsel and shall define that independent counsel's prosecutorial jurisdiction. The appointment shall occur no later than 30 days after the receipt of the application. (2) The panel shall appoint as independent counsel an individual who has appropriate experience and who will conduct the investigation and any prosecution in a prompt, responsible and cost-effective manner. The panel shall seek to appoint as independent counsel an individual who will serve to the extent necessary to complete the investigation and any prosecution without undue delay. The panel may not appoint as an independent counsel any person who holds any office of profit or trust with the Commonwealth. A person who is serving as a special investigative counsel may not be appointed or serve as an independent counsel in the matter for which the person had been appointed to investigate as special investigative counsel. If an independent counsel is appointed, the independent counsel may only accept the appointment when the appointment would not conflict with the rules governing professional conduct. (3) In defining the independent counsel's prosecutorial jurisdiction, the panel shall assure that the independent counsel has adequate authority to fully investigate and prosecute the subject matter with respect to which the special investigative counsel has requested the appointment of the independent counsel and all matters related to that subject matter. Jurisdiction shall also include the authority to investigate and prosecute an offense classified higher than a summary offense or a contempt of court which may arise out of the investigation with respect to which the special investigative counsel's request was made. (4) The panel shall disclose the identity of the independent counsel upon appointment. (b) Expansion of jurisdiction.-- (1) The panel upon the request of a district attorney or a requesting judge may expand the prosecutorial jurisdiction of an independent counsel. The expansion may be in lieu of the appointment of another independent counsel. (2) If the independent counsel discovers or receives information about possible violations of criminal law by persons as provided in section 9512 (relating to preliminary investigation) which are not covered by the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel, the independent counsel may submit the information to a district attorney. In accordance with this subchapter, a district attorney shall petition the panel to appoint a special investigative counsel to conduct a preliminary investigation of the information, except that the preliminary investigation shall not exceed 30 days from the date the information is received. In making the determinations required by this subchapter, the special investigative counsel shall give great weight to any recommendations of the independent counsel. (3) If the special investigative counsel determines, after according great weight to the recommendations of the independent counsel, that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted, the special investigative counsel shall promptly notify the panel. (4) The panel shall expand the jurisdiction of the appropriate independent counsel to include the matters involved or shall appoint another independent counsel to investigate the matters if: (i) the special investigative counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted; or (ii) the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (2) elapses without a notification to the panel that no further investigation is warranted. (5) If the independent counsel discovers or receives information about possible violations of criminal law by persons other than those provided for in section 9512 and which are not covered by the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel and a request for expansion under this subsection has not been made by a district attorney or a requesting judge or the request for expansion under this subsection has been denied by the panel, the independent counsel shall submit the information to the appropriate law enforcement authority. (c) Return for further explanation.-- Upon receipt of a notification under this subchapter that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted with respect to information received under this chapter, the panel shall have no authority to overrule this determination but may return the matter to the special investigative counsel for further explanation of the reasons for the determination. (d) Vacancies.-- If a vacancy in office arises by reason of the resignation, death or removal of an independent counsel, the panel shall appoint an independent counsel to complete the work of the independent counsel whose resignation, death or removal caused the vacancy, except that, in the case of a vacancy arising by reason of the removal of an independent counsel, the panel may appoint an acting independent counsel to serve until any judicial review of the removal is completed.",

(d) Indexing: real-property-related financing statement.-- If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, the filing office shall index it: (1) under the names of the debtor and of each owner of record shown on the financing statement as if they were the mortgagors under a mortgage of the real property described; and (2) to the extent that the law of this Commonwealth provides for indexing of records of mortgages under the name of the mortgagee, under the name of the secured party as if the secured party were the mortgagee thereunder or, if indexing is by description, as if the financing statement were a record of a mortgage of the real property described. (e) Indexing: real-property-related assignment.-- If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, the filing office shall index an assignment filed under section 9514(a) (relating to assignment reflected on initial financing statement) or an amendment filed under section 9514(b) (relating to assignment of filed financing statement): (1) under the name of the assignor as grantor; and (2) to the extent that the law of this Commonwealth provides for indexing a record of the assignment of a mortgage under the name of the assignee, under the name of the assignee.

(g) Removal of debtor's name.-- The filing office may not remove a debtor's name from the index until one year after the effectiveness of a financing statement naming the debtor lapses under section 9515 (relating to duration and effectiveness of financing statement; effect of lapsed financing statement) with respect to all secured parties of record. (h) Timeliness of filing office performance.-- Except as provided in subsection (i), the filing office shall perform the acts required by subsections (a) through (e) at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule but not later than five business days after the filing office receives the record in question. (i) Inapplicability to real-property-related filing office.-- Subsections (b) and (h) do not apply to a filing office described in section 9501(a)(1) (relating to filing offices). Cross References.
