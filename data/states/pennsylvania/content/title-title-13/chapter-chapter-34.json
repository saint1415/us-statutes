If the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.\n\n(c) Application.--Under subsection (b), an indorsement is made in the name of the person to whom an instrument is payable if:\n\n(1) it is made in a name substantially similar to the name of that person; or\n\n(2) the instrument, whether or not indorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to the name of that person.\n\nCross References.Section 3405 is referred to in sections 3417, 4208 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Definition of \"acceptance\".--\"Acceptance\" means the drawee's signed agreement to pay a draft as presented. It must be written on the draft and may consist of the drawee's signature alone. Acceptance may be made at any time and becomes effective when notification pursuant to instructions is given or the accepted draft is delivered for the purpose of giving rights on the acceptance to any person.\n\n(b) Acceptance of incomplete, overdue or dishonored draft.--A draft may be accepted although it has not been signed by the drawer, is otherwise incomplete, is overdue or has been dishonored.\n\n(c) Failure to date acceptance of sight draft.--If a draft is payable at a fixed period after sight and the acceptor fails to date the acceptance, the holder may complete the acceptance by supplying a date in good faith.\n\n(d) Definition of \"certified check\".--\"Certified check\" means a check accepted by the bank on which it is drawn. Acceptance may be made as stated in subsection (a) or by a writing on the check which indicates that the check is certified. The drawee of a check has no obligation to certify the check, and refusal to certify is not dishonor of the check.\n\nCross References.Section 3409 is referred to in sections 3103, 4104, 5102 of this title.",

In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment.
