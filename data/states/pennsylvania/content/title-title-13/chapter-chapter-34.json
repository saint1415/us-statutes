If the represented person is bound, the signature of the representative is the \"authorized signature of the represented person\" and the represented person is liable on the instrument, whether or not identified in the instrument.\n\n(b) When representative is bound by signature.--If a representative signs the name of the representative to an instrument and the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) If the form of the signature shows unambiguously that the signature is made on behalf of the represented person who is identified in the instrument, the representative is not liable on the instrument.\n\n(2) Subject to subsection (c), if the form of the signature does not show unambiguously that the signature is made in a representative capacity or the represented person is not identified in the instrument, the representative is liable on the instrument to a holder in due course that took the instrument without notice that the representative was not intended to be liable on the instrument. With respect to any other person, the representative is liable on the instrument unless the representative proves that the original parties did not intend the representative to be liable on the instrument.\n\n(c) Checks.--If a representative signs the name of the representative as drawer of a check without indication of the representative status and the check is payable from an account of the represented person who is identified on the check, the signer is not liable on the check if the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person.\n\nCross References.Section 3402 is referred to in sections 3308, 3401 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Accommodation party.--If an instrument is issued for value given for the benefit of a party to the instrument (\"accommodated party\") and another party to the instrument (\"accommodation party\") signs the instrument for the purpose of incurring liability on the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for the instrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party \"for accommodation.\"\n\n(b) Liability of accommodation party.--An accommodation party may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor or indorser and, subject to subsection (d), is obliged to pay the instrument in the capacity in which the accommodation party signs. The obligation of an accommodation party may be enforced notwithstanding any statute of frauds and whether or not the accommodation party receives consideration for the accommodation.\n\n(c) Presumption.--A person signing an instrument is presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the instrument is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous indorsement or is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party to the instrument. Except as provided in section 3605 (relating to discharge of indorsers and accommodation parties), the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation.\n\n(d) Limitation on liability.--If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument only if:\n\n(1) execution of judgment against the other party has been returned unsatisfied;\n\n(2) the other party is insolvent or in an insolvency proceeding;\n\n(3) the other party cannot be served with process; or\n\n(4) it is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from the other party.\n\n(e) Rights between accommodation and accommodated parties.--An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against the accommodated party. An accommodated party who pays the instrument has no right of recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party.\n\nCross References.Section 3419 is referred to in sections 3103, 3116, 3415, 3605 of this title.",

An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a copayee.\n\n(b) Measure of damages.--In an action under subsection (a), the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument.\n\n(c) Limitation on liability.--A representative, other than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.\n\nCross References.Section 3420 is referred to in section 4203 of this title.",
