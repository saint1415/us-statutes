      "text": "(a) Scope of section.--This section is subject to sections 4A205 (relating to erroneous payment orders) and 4A207 (relating to misdescription of beneficiary).\n\n(b) Payment order issued to beneficiary's bank.--With respect to a payment order issued to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the order, but payment is not due until the payment date of the order.\n\n(c) Payment order issued to receiving bank other than beneficiary's bank.--This subsection is subject to subsection (e) and to section 4A303 (relating to erroneous execution of payment order). With respect to a payment order issued to a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the receiving bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the sender's order. Payment by the sender is not due until the execution date of the sender's order. The obligation of that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order.\n\n(d) Refund.--If the sender of a payment order pays the order and was not obliged to pay all or part of the amount paid, the bank receiving payment is obliged to refund payment to the extent the sender was not obliged to pay. Except as provided in sections 4A204 (relating to refund of payment and duty of customer to report with respect to unauthorized payment order) and 4A304 (relating to duty of sender to report erroneously executed payment order), interest is payable on the refundable amount from the date of payment.\n\n(e) Certain subrogation rights.--If a funds transfer is not completed as stated in subsection (c) and an intermediary bank is obliged to refund payment as stated in subsection (d) but is unable to do so because not permitted by applicable law or because the bank suspends payments, a sender in the funds transfer that executed a payment order in compliance with an instruction, as stated in section 4A302(a)(1) (relating to obligations of receiving bank in execution of payment order), to route the funds transfer through that intermediary bank is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the payment order that it accepted. The first sender in the funds transfer that issued an instruction requiring routing through that intermediary bank is subrogated to the right of the bank that paid the intermediary bank to refund as stated in subsection (d).\n\n(f) Prohibition against modification by agreement of certain rights of sender.--The right of the sender of a payment order to be excused from the obligation to pay the order as stated in subsection (c) or to receive refund under subsection (d) may not be varied by agreement.\n\nCross References.Section 4A402 is referred to in sections 4A303, 4A304, 4A403, 4A405 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) When payment occurs.--Payment of the sender's obligation under section 4A402 (relating to obligation of sender to pay receiving bank) to pay the receiving bank occurs as follows:\n\n(1) If the sender is a bank, payment occurs when the receiving bank receives final settlement of the obligation through a Federal Reserve bank or through a funds-transfer system.\n\n(2) If the sender is a bank and the sender credited an account of the receiving bank with the sender or caused an account of the receiving bank in another bank to be credited, payment occurs when the credit is withdrawn or, if not withdrawn, at midnight of the day on which the credit is withdrawable and the receiving bank learns of that fact.\n\n(3) If the receiving bank debits an account of the sender with the receiving bank, payment occurs when the debit is made to the extent the debit is covered by a withdrawable credit balance in the account.\n\n(b) Multilateral settlements.--If the sender and receiving bank are members of a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank receives final settlement when settlement is complete in accordance with the rules of the system. The obligation of the sender to pay the amount of a payment order transmitted through the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against the sender's obligation the right of the sender to receive payment from the receiving bank of the amount of any other payment order transmitted to the sender by the receiving bank through the funds-transfer system. The aggregate balance of obligations owed by each sender to each receiving bank in the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against that balance the aggregate balance of obligations owed to the sender by other members of the system. The aggregate balance is determined after the right of setoff stated in the second sentence of this subsection has been exercised.\n\n(c) When two banks transmit payment orders to each other under agreement that settlement will be at certain date.--If two banks transmit payment orders to each other under an agreement that settlement of the obligations of each bank to the other under section 4A402 will be made at the end of the day or other period, the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by one bank shall be set off against the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by the other bank. To the extent of the setoff, each bank has made payment to the other.\n\n(d) Other cases when payment occurs.--In a case not covered by subsection (a), the time when payment of the sender's obligation under section 4A402(b) or (c) occurs is governed by applicable principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.\n\nCross References.Section 4A403 is referred to in sections 4A105, 4A209 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Obligation.--Subject to sections 4A211(e) (relating to cancellation and amendment of payment order) and 4A405(d) and (e) (relating to payment by beneficiary's bank to beneficiary), if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, the bank is obliged to pay the amount of the order to the beneficiary of the order. Payment is due on the payment date of the order, but if acceptance occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank, payment is due on the next funds-transfer business day. If the bank refuses to pay after demand by the beneficiary and receipt of notice of particular circumstances that will give rise to consequential damages as a result of nonpayment, the beneficiary may recover damages resulting from the refusal to pay to the extent the bank had notice of the damages, unless the bank proves that it did not pay because of a reasonable doubt concerning the right of the beneficiary to payment.\n\n(b) Notice.--If a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank instructs payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to notify the beneficiary of receipt of the order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date. If the payment order does not instruct payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is required to notify the beneficiary only if notice is required by the order. Notice may be given by first class mail or any other means reasonable in the circumstances. If the bank fails to give the required notice, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of the payment order from the day notice should have been given until the day the beneficiary learned of receipt of the payment order by the bank. No other damages are recoverable. Reasonable attorney fees are also recoverable if demand for interest is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.\n\n(c) Prohibition against modification of certain rights of beneficiary.--The right of a beneficiary to receive payment and damages as stated in subsection (a) may not be varied by agreement or a funds-transfer system rule. The right of a beneficiary to be notified as stated in subsection (b) may be varied by agreement of the beneficiary or by a funds-transfer system rule if the beneficiary is notified of the rule before initiation of the funds transfer.\n\nCross References.Section 4A404 is referred to in sections 4A405, 4A406, 4A501 of this title.",

A beneficiary's bank that makes a payment that is provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if:\n\n(1) the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is initiated;\n\n(2) the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank and the originator's bank agreed to be bound by the rule; and\n\n(3) the beneficiary's bank did not receive payment of the payment order that it accepted.\n\nIf the beneficiary is obliged to refund payment to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the payment order by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no payment by the originator of the funds transfer to the beneficiary occurs under section 4A406 (relating to payment by originator to beneficiary; discharge of underlying obligation).\n\n(e) Funds-transfer systems having loss-sharing rules.--This subsection applies to a funds transfer that includes a payment order transmitted over a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants and has in effect a loss-sharing agreement among participants for the purpose of providing funds necessary to complete settlement of the obligations of one or more participants that do not meet their settlement obligations. If the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system fails to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment order in the funds transfer, the acceptance by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover payment from the beneficiary, no payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under section 4A406 and, subject to section 4A402(e) (relating to obligation of sender to pay receiving bank), each sender in the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order under section 4A402(c) because the funds transfer has not been completed.\n\nCross References.Section 4A405 is referred to in sections 4A105, 4A209, 4A404, 4A406, 4A501 of this title.",
