A payment order received by the beneficiary's bank can be accepted but cannot be executed.\n\n(b) Execution date.--\"Execution date\" of a payment order means the day on which the receiving bank may properly issue a payment order in execution of the sender's order. The execution date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received. If the sender's instruction states a payment date, the execution date is the payment date or an earlier date on which execution is reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date.\n\nCross References.Section 4A301 is referred to in section 4A105 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) General rule.--Except as provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d), if the receiving bank accepts a payment order pursuant to section 4A209(a) (relating to acceptance of payment order), the bank has the following obligations in executing the order:\n\n(1) The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow the sender's instructions concerning:\n\n(i) any intermediary bank or funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer; or\n\n(ii) the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer.\n\nIf the originator's bank issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the originator's bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the instruction of the originator. An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment order it accepts.\n\n(2) If the sender's instruction states that the funds transfer is to be carried out telephonically or by wire transfer or otherwise indicates that the funds transfer is to be carried out by the most expeditious means, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order by the most expeditious available means and to instruct any intermediary bank accordingly. If a sender's instruction states a payment date, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order at a time and by means reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date or as soon thereafter as is feasible.\n\n(b) Discretion of receiving bank.--Unless otherwise instructed, a receiving bank executing a payment order may:\n\n(1) use any funds-transfer system if use of that system is reasonable in the circumstances; and\n\n(2) issue a payment order to the beneficiary's bank or to an intermediary bank through which a payment order conforming to the sender's order can expeditiously be issued to the beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in the selection of the intermediary bank.\n\nA receiving bank is not required to follow an instruction of the sender designating a funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer if the receiving bank, in good faith, determines that it is not feasible to follow the instruction or that following the instruction would unduly delay completion of the funds transfer.\n\n(c) Manner by which receiving bank may execute payment order in certain circumstances.--Unless subsection (a)(2) applies or the receiving bank is otherwise instructed, the bank may execute a payment order by transmitting its payment order by first class mail or by any means reasonable in the circumstances. If the receiving bank is instructed to execute the sender's order by transmitting its payment order by a particular means, the receiving bank may issue its payment order by the means stated or by any means as expeditious as the means stated.\n\n(d) Certain prohibited acts of receiving bank.--Unless instructed by the sender, the receiving bank:\n\n(1) may not obtain payment of its charges for services and expenses in connection with the execution of the sender's order by issuing a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the sender's order less the amount of the charges; and\n\n(2) may not instruct a subsequent receiving bank to obtain payment of its charges in the same manner.\n\nCross References.Section 4A302 is referred to in sections 4A208, 4A305, 4A402 of this title.",

The bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the erroneous order the excess payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.\n\n(b) Issuance of payment order in amount less than amount of sender's order.--A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under section 4A402(c) if that subsection is otherwise satisfied and the bank corrects its mistake by issuing an additional payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary of the sender's order. If the error is not corrected, the issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the order it accepted only to the extent of the amount of the erroneous order. This subsection does not apply if the receiving bank executes the sender's payment order by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order for the purpose of obtaining payment of its charges for services and expenses pursuant to instruction of the sender.\n\n(c) Issuance of payment order to wrong beneficiary.--If a receiving bank executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order to a beneficiary different from the beneficiary of the sender's order and the funds transfer is completed on the basis of that error, the sender of the payment order that was erroneously executed and all previous senders in the funds transfer are not obliged to pay the payment orders they issued. The issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the order the payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.\n\nCross References.Section 4A303 is referred to in sections 4A304, 4A402 of this title.",
