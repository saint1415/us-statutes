      "text": "(a) General rule.--Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is a record sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by the party's authorized agent or broker. A record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in the record.\n\n(b) Writing confirming contract between merchants.--Between merchants if within a reasonable time a record in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (a) against the party unless notice in a record of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.\n\n(c) Enforceability of contracts not satisfying general requirements.--A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (a) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable:\n\n(1) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the business of the seller and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement;\n\n(2) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or\n\n(3) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (section 2606).\n\n(d) Qualified financial contracts.--Subsection (a) does not apply to a qualified financial contract, as defined in section 1206(c)(1) (relating to statute of frauds for kinds of personal property not otherwise covered), if either:\n\n(1) there is, as provided in section 1206(c)(3), sufficient evidence to indicate that a contract has been made; or\n\n(2) the parties, by means of a prior or subsequent written contract, have agreed to be bound by the terms of the qualified financial contract from the time they reach agreement (by telephone, by exchange of electronic messages or otherwise) on those terms.\n\n(May 22, 1996, P.L.248, No.44, eff. imd.; July 1, 2024, P.L.450, No.41, eff. 60 days)\n\n2024 Amendment.Act 41 amended subsecs. (a) and (b). See section 1 of Act 41 in the appendix to this title for special provisions relating to findings and declarations.\n\n1996 Amendment.Act 44 added subsec. (d). See section 14(c) of Act 44 in the appendix to this title for special provisions relating to applicability to qualified financial contracts.\n\nReferences in Text.Section 1206, referred to in this section, was repealed and added by the act of April 16, 2008 (P.L.57, No.13). Present section 1206 relates to presumptions.\n\nCross References.Section 2201 is referred to in sections 2209, 2326 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Delegation of performance.--A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.\n\n(b) Assignment of rights.--Except as otherwise provided in section 9406 (relating to discharge of account debtor; notification of assignment; identification and proof of assignment; restrictions on assignment of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles and promissory notes ineffective), unless otherwise agreed, all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of due performance by the assignor of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.\n\n(c) Effect of security interest.--The creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (b) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but:\n\n(1) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer; and\n\n(2) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.\n\n(d) Assignment prohibition limited to performance.--Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary, a prohibition of assignment of \"the contract\" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the performance of the assignor.\n\n(e) Effect and enforceability of general assignment.--An assignment of \"the contract\" or of \"all my rights under the contract\" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.\n\n(f) Security for assignment delegating performance.--The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (section 2609).\n\n(June 8, 2001, P.L.123, No.18, eff. July 1, 2001)\n\n2001 Amendment.Act 18 amended subsec. (b), relettered subsec. (c) to subsec. (d), subsec. (d) to subsec. (e) and subsec. (e) to subsec. (f) and added a new subsec. (c).",
