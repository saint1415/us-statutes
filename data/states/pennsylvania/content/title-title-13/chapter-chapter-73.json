      "text": "(a) Liability.--A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith, or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description of the goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damages caused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity or condition or the receipt or description is qualified by \"contents or condition of contents of packages unknown,\" \"said to contain,\" \"shipper's weight, load and count\" or words of similar import, if that indication is true.\n\n(b) Package count.--If goods are loaded by the issuer of the bill of lading:\n\n(1) the issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain the kind and quantity if shipped in bulk; and\n\n(2) words such as \"shipper's weight, load and count,\" or words of similar import indicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods concealed by packages.\n\n(c) Kind and quantity.--If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of the bill of lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper's request in a record to do so. In that case, \"shipper's weight\" or words of similar import are ineffective.\n\n(d) Deference to shipper.--The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill of lading the words \"shipper's weight, load and count,\" or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the shipper; and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the improper loading. However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damages caused by improper loading.\n\n(e) Accuracy guaranteed.--A shipper guarantees to the issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition and weight, as furnished by the shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in those particulars. This right of indemnity does not limit its responsibility or liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.",

However, to the extent that the bill or other document covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or in territory not contiguous to the continental United States or an undertaking including matters other than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or the performing carrier may be varied by agreement of the parties.\n\n(b) Liability of person other than issuer.--If goods covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by a person other than the issuer are received by that person, the person is subject, with respect to its own performance while the goods are in its possession, to the obligation of the issuer. The person's obligation is discharged by delivery of the goods to another person pursuant to the bill or other document and does not include liability for breach by any other person or by the issuer.\n\n(c) Damages.--The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title described in subsection (a) is entitled to recover from the performing carrier, or other person in possession of the goods, when the breach of the obligation under the bill or other document occurred:\n\n(1) the amount it may be required to pay to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for the breach, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment or transcript of judgment; and\n\n(2) the amount of any expense reasonably incurred by the issuer in defending any action commenced by any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for the breach.",
