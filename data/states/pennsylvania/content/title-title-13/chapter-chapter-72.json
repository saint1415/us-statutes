Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damages that could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.\n\n(b) Contractual limitation.--Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is not liable. Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse's liability for conversion to its own use. On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse's liability may be increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehouse receipt. In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of the goods.\n\n(c) Claim presentation.--Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement.\n\nCross References.Section 7204 is referred to in section 7202 of this title.",

If the goods are not removed before the date specified in the notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to section 7210 (relating to enforcement of warehouse's lien).\n\n(b) Perishable goods.--If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of its lien within the time provided in subsection (a) and section 7210, the warehouse may specify in the notice given under subsection (a) any reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed, may sell them at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.\n\n(c) Hazardous goods.--If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did not have notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehouse facilities or other persons, the warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale without advertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it may dispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.\n\n(d) Demand.--A warehouse shall deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under this division upon due demand made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.\n\n(e) Lien satisfaction.--A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition under this section but shall hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.",

      "text": "(a) Existence.--\n\n(1) A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor or other charges, present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.\n\n(2) The warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse if:\n\n(i) the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited; and\n\n(ii) it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods.\n\n(3) However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.\n\n(b) Security interest.--A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (a), such as for money advanced and interest. A security interest is governed by Division 9 (relating to secured transactions).\n\n(c) Effectiveness against entrustors.--\n\n(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (2), a warehouse's lien for charges and expenses under subsection (a) or a security interest under subsection (b) is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good-faith purchaser for value would have been valid.\n\n(2) The lien or security interest is not effective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:\n\n(i) deliver or entrust the goods or any document covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's nominee with:\n\n(A) actual or apparent authority to ship, store or sell;\n\n(B) power to obtain delivery under section 7403 (relating to obligation of bailee to deliver; excuse); or\n\n(C) power of disposition under section 2403 (relating to power to transfer; good faith purchase of goods; \"entrusting\"), 2A304(a)(2) (relating to subsequent lease of goods by lessor), 2A305(a)(2) (relating to sale or sublease of goods by lessee), 9320 (relating to buyer of goods) or 9321(c) (relating to licensee of general intangible and lessee of goods in ordinary course of business) or other statute or rule of law; or\n\n(ii) acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.\n\n(d) Effectiveness in general.--A warehouse's lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the goods under subsection (a) is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal possessor of the goods at the time of deposit. As used in this subsection, the term \"household goods\" means furniture, furnishings or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.\n\n(e) Losing lien.--A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.",

The advertisement must include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least 15 days after the first publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must be posted at least ten days before the sale in not less than six conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale.\n\n(c) Satisfaction.--Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this division.\n\n(d) Purchase by warehouse.--A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.\n\n(e) Purchaser in good faith.--A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse's noncompliance with this section.\n\n(f) Proceeds of sale.--A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.\n\n(g) Additional rights.--The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.\n\n(h) Goods stored by merchant.--If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien may be enforced in accordance with subsection (a) or (b).\n\n(i) Liability of warehouse.--A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.\n\nCross References.Section 7210 is referred to in sections 7206, 7308 of this title.",
