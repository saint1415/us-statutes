Goods which are not both existing and identified are \"future\" goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.\n\n(c) Sale of part interest in goods.--There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods.\n\n(d) Fungible goods.--An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the interest of the seller in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common.\n\n(e) \"Lot\".--\"Lot\" means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract.\n\n(f) \"Commercial unit\".--\"Commercial unit\" means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use.

The term includes also a bank or other person who similarly intervenes between persons who are in the position of seller and buyer in respect to the goods (see section 2707).\n\n\"Merchant.\"A person who:\n\n(1) deals in goods of the kind; or\n\n(2) otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.\n\n(June 8, 2001, P.L.123, No.18, eff.

A \"present sale\" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.\n\n(b) \"Conforming\" to contract.--Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are \"conforming\" or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.\n\n(c) \"Termination\".--\"Termination\" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On \"termination\" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.\n\n(d) \"Cancellation\".--\"Cancellation\" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of \"termination\" except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.\n\n(e) \"Hybrid transaction\".--A single transaction involving a sale of goods and:\n\n(1) the provision of services;\n\n(2) a lease of other goods; or\n\n(3) a sale, lease or license of property other than goods.\n\n(July 1, 2024, P.L.450, No.41, eff. 60 days)\n\n2024 Amendment.Act 41 the section heading and subsec.
