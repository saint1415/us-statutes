      "text": "(a) Applicable rules if amount of deficiency or surplus in issue.--In an action arising from a transaction, other than a consumer transaction, in which the amount of a deficiency or surplus is in issue, the following rules apply:\n\n(1) A secured party need not prove compliance with the provisions of this chapter relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance unless the debtor or a secondary obligor places the secured party's compliance in issue.\n\n(2) If the secured party's compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was conducted in accordance with this chapter.\n\n(3) Except as otherwise provided in section 9628 (relating to nonliability and limitation on liability of secured party; liability of secondary obligor), if a secured party fails to prove that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was conducted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance, the liability of a debtor or a secondary obligor for a deficiency is limited to an amount by which the sum of the secured obligation, expenses and attorney fees exceeds the greater of:\n\n(i) the proceeds of the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance; or\n\n(ii) the amount of proceeds which would have been realized had the noncomplying secured party proceeded in accordance with the provisions of this chapter relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance.\n\n(4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(ii), the amount of proceeds which would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses and attorney fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum.\n\n(5) If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under section 9615(f) (relating to calculation of surplus or deficiency in disposition to person related to secured party), the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices which a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party or a secondary obligor would have brought.\n\n(b) Nonconsumer transactions; no inference.--The limitation of the rules in subsection (a) to transactions other than consumer transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer transactions. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.\n\nCross References.Section 9626 is referred to in sections 9602, 9625 of this title.",

      "text": "(a) Greater amount obtainable under other circumstances; no preclusion of commercial reasonableness.--The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner.\n\n(b) Dispositions which are commercially reasonable.--A disposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made:\n\n(1) in the usual manner on any recognized market;\n\n(2) at the price current in any recognized market at the time of the disposition; or\n\n(3) otherwise in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property which was the subject of the disposition.\n\n(c) Approval by court or on behalf of creditors.--A collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance is commercially reasonable if it has been approved:\n\n(1) in a judicial proceeding;\n\n(2) by a bona fide creditors' committee;\n\n(3) by a representative of creditors; or\n\n(4) by an assignee for the benefit of creditors.\n\n(d) Approval under subsection (c) not necessary; absence of approval has no effect.--Approval under subsection (c) need not be obtained, and lack of approval does not mean that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance is not commercially reasonable.",
