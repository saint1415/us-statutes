      "text": "(a) Eligibility.--In addition to the criteria prescribed in section 1302 (relating to Category 1 slot machine license), an applicant for a Category 1 slot machine license shall be eligible for a license to place and operate slot machines at a licensed facility only if the applicant meets one of the following criteria:\n\n(1) the licensed racing entity or its predecessor owner of the licensed racetrack has conducted live horse races for not less than two years immediately preceding the effective date of this part; or\n\n(2) the licensed racing entity has not previously conducted live racing at a racetrack but will conduct live racing for a minimum of 150 days to begin in the year which begins two years following the issuance of its slot machine license for the racetrack unless the appropriate commission determines, upon application, that it is not practically feasible for the licensed racing entity to conduct live racing for a minimum of 150 days due to projected or actual weather conditions. Failure to meet the required minimum number of days will result in immediate suspension of the slot machine license.\n\n(b) Required racing days.--Except as provided in subsection (a)(2), a Category 1 slot machine licensee must conduct live racing at the racetrack for at least 100 days per calendar year for each license held by the licensed racing entity pursuant to the Race Horse Industry Reform Act, and the aggregate number of live racing days at the racetrack where the Category 1 slot machine licensee conducts live racing shall not be less than 95% of the total number of horse or harness racing days that were scheduled in 1986 at that racetrack.

The purse for that racing day shall not be used for the purse of other scheduled racing days of that calendar year and must be used for the purse of such rescheduled day.\n\n(c) Limitations.--The issuance of a Category 1 slot machine license shall entitle the licensee to operate slot machines only within the grounds of a licensed racetrack.\n\n(d) Authorization.--Authorization for a Category 1 slot machine licensee to continue the operation of slot machines shall be limited to those licensees that:\n\n(1) Have a written live racing agreement with a horsemen's organization representing a majority of owners and trainers at the racetrack where the licensed racing entity conducts live racing.\n\n(2) Have 95% of the total number of horse or harness racing days that were scheduled in 1986 by it or its predecessor at the racetrack where the Category 1 slot machine licensee conducts live racing, and the aggregate number of live racing days at the racetrack where the Category 1 slot machine licensee conducts live racing shall not be less than 95% of the total number of horse or harness racing days that were scheduled in 1986 at that racetrack. A new licensee which opens a new racetrack and which will successfully conduct live racing for a minimum of 150 days to begin no later than in the year which begins two years following the issuance of its slot machine license for the racetrack, unless the appropriate commission determines upon application that it is not practically feasible for the licensed racing entity to conduct live racing for a minimum of 150 days due to projected or actual weather conditions, shall be allowed to operate slot machines, from the date its slot machine license is issued and intrastate and interstate simulcast in accordance with the Race Horse Industry Reform Act, from the first day of the calendar year in which it conducts live racing days.\n\n(3) Unless the horsemen's organization representing a majority of the owners and trainers consents to a lower number of required racing days at the racetrack, subject to actions or activities beyond the control of the licensee, conduct not fewer than eight live races per race date during each meet at the racetrack where the licensed racing entity conducts live racing, except for thoroughbred tracks on the day designated as a Breeder's Cup event day when the licensed racing entity shall hold a minimum of five live races. The Category 1 slot machine licensee shall not waive or modify the provisions pertaining to the required number of racing days under paragraph (2) and races per day scheduled in this paragraph without the consent of the horsemen's organization representing a majority of owners and trainers at the racetrack.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), in the event that a written live racing agreement has not been entered into, permission for any licensee to operate slot machines at racetracks shall be granted provided that the Category 1 slot machine licensee has continued to conduct live racing in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) and keeps its racetrack open to the general population of owners, trainers and horses stabled there for training and stabling on a regular basis, when it is normally open for live racing and during such periods, and continues to comply with all provisions of the most recently expired live racing agreement, including recognition of the then existing horsemen's organization at each such racetrack as the sole representative of the horsemen at that time, and pays purses as defined in the most recently expired live racing agreement plus the applicable purse revenue distributed to licensed racing entities from the operation of slot machines under this part. Nothing in this part shall exempt an existing or future licensed racetrack from the requirements of the Race Horse Industry Reform Act requiring a licensed corporation to have a written and unexpired live racing agreement with the horsemen's organization representing a majority of owners and trainers at the racetrack where the licensed corporation conducts or will conduct live racing dates in order to continue or commence any form of simulcasting.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the contrary, account wagers authorized pursuant to section 218(b) of the Race Horse Industry Reform Act shall only be accepted by a licensed corporation in accordance with the provisions of the Race Horse Industry Reform Act, and no entity that is not a licensed corporation under that act shall accept an account wager from any person within this Commonwealth.\n\nReferences in Text.The act of December 17, 1981, P.L.435, No.135, known as the Race Horse Industry Reform Act, referred to in this section, was repealed by the act of February 23, 2016, P.L.15, No.7.\n\nCross References.Section 1303 is referred to in section 1302 of this title; sections 9317, 9329 of Title 3 (Agriculture).",
