Due to this economic interest, enhancements to current gaming activities must be authorized to ensure the ongoing competitiveness, viability and stability of the gaming industry in this Commonwealth.\n\n(2) A primary intent of the Race Horse Development and Gaming Act, as codified in this part, is to enhance live horse racing. However, the legalization of commercial gaming in states on the geographic borders of this Commonwealth makes it imperative to authorize new and innovative gaming activities related to horse racing and commercial casino-style gaming, which could be implemented by licensed gaming entities, and which could help ensure the viability of both horse racing and commercial gaming.\n\n(3) The intent of this chapter is to give licensed gaming entities the authority to conduct casino simulcasting at Category 2, Category 3 and Category 4 licensed facilities in order to expand horse racing opportunities through simulcasting and, thereby, enhancing the viability of this Commonwealth's race horse and commercial gaming industry.",
