The petition shall request that the court enter a rule upon the agency to show cause why the agency should not be directed to disclose to the bureau, or identified agents thereof, information in its possession about any pending matter under the jurisdiction of the bureau pursuant to this part. If a respondent is a local agency, a copy of any rule issued pursuant to this section shall be provided to the district attorney of the county in which the local agency is located and the Office of Attorney General. Upon request of a local agency, the district attorney or the Attorney General may elect to enter an appearance to represent the local agency in the proceedings.\n\n(b) Procedure.--The filing of a petition pursuant to this section and related proceedings shall be in accordance with court rule, including issuance as of course.

The court shall grant the request if it is in the best interest of any person or the Commonwealth to do so.\n\n(c) Court determination.--Following review of the record, the court shall grant the relief sought by the director of the Office of Enforcement Counsel if the court determines that the agency has in its possession information material to the investigation or inquiry and that disclosure or release of the information is in the best interest of the Commonwealth, that the disclosure or release of the information is not otherwise prohibited by statute or regulation and that the disclosure or release of the information would not inhibit an agency in the performance of the agency's duties.

Upon such request, the court may modify its orders at any time and in any manner it deems necessary and appropriate. The agency named in the original petition shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n\n(f) Use of information or materials.--Any person who, by any means authorized by this section, has obtained knowledge of information or materials solely pursuant to this section may use such information or materials in a manner consistent with any directions imposed by the court and appropriate to the proper performance of the person's official duties under this part.\n\n(g) Violation.--In addition to any remedies and penalties provided in this part, any violation of the provisions of this section may be punished as contempt of the court.\n\n(h) Definition.--As used in this section the term \"agency\" shall mean a \"Commonwealth agency\" or a \"local agency\" as those terms are defined in section 102 of the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law.\n\n(Jan. 7, 2010, P.L.1, No.1, eff. imd.)\n\n2010 Amendment.Act 1 added section 1518.2.",
