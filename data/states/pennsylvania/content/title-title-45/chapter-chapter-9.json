      "text": "(a) General rule.--The official text, as published as provided in Subchapter B of Chapter 7 (relating to publication of documents), of any document required or authorized to be published in the code, the permanent supplements thereto, or the bulletin, shall from the date of such publication be the only valid and enforceable text of such document regardless of any discrepancy between such official text and the agency text of such document. Thereafter any amendment to such document shall be drawn as an amendment to the official text thereof. If an agency discovers a discrepancy between the agency text and the official text of a document, the agency shall forthwith deposit, without regard to the requirements of 2 Pa.C.S. § 301 (relating to notice of proposed rule making) and 2 Pa.C.S. § 302 (relating to adoption of administrative regulations) with the Legislative Reference Bureau an appropriate corrective amendment to the official text, and the agency may specify that such amendment shall be effective as of the effective date of the defective official text, but only persons who have had actual knowledge of the discrepancy shall be affected by such amendment prior to the publication of the official text thereof in the manner prescribed in this part. The purpose of this section is to permit the public to rely absolutely upon the correctness of the text of a regulation, statement of policy or other document as published in the code, the supplements thereto, or the bulletin by declaring such published text to be the only legal evidence of the valid and enforceable text of such regulation, statement of policy or other document.\n\n(b) Home rule charter documents and optional plans of government.--(Deleted by amendment).\n\n(Sept. 24, 2014, P.L.2461, No.133, eff. 60 days)\n\n2014 Amendment.Act 133 deleted subsec.
