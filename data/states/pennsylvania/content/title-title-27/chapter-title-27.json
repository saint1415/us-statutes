(ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113 (relating to pedestrian-control signals), pedestrians facing any green signal may proceed across the roadway within a crosswalk. (2) Steady yellow indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green indication is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 3113, pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. (3) Steady red indication.-- (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, or if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subparagraph (ii). (ii) Unless signing is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way highway onto a one-way highway after stopping as required by subparagraph (i). Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. (c) Inoperable or malfunctioning signal.-- If a traffic-control signal is out of operation or is not functioning properly, including, but not limited to, a signal that uses inductive loop sensors or other automated technology to detect the presence of vehicles that fails to detect a vehicle, vehicular traffic facing a: (1) Green or yellow signal may proceed with caution as indicated in subsection (a)(1) and (2).

      "text": "§ 6208. Penalties. (a) Criminal penalties.-- A transporter who violates the provisions of this chapter commits a misdemeanor of the third degree and, upon conviction for the first offense, shall pay a penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $10,000. Upon the second or subsequent conviction of an offense under this chapter, a transporter commits a misdemeanor of the second degree and shall pay a penalty of not less than $10,000 nor more than $25,000, and the court may order the operating privilege of the transporter to be suspended for a period of up to one year, or both. (b) Civil penalties.-- (1) In addition to proceeding under any other remedy available at law or in equity for a violation of any provision of this chapter, the regulations promulgated hereunder, any order of the department issued under this chapter or any term or condition of a written authorization, the department may assess a civil penalty upon a transporter. Such penalty may be assessed whether or not the violation was willful or negligent. In determining the amount of the penalty, the department shall consider the willfulness of the violation, the effect on waste transportation safety, damage to the natural resources of this Commonwealth or their uses, cost of restoration and abatement, savings resulting to the violator in consequence of such violation, deterrence of future violations and other relevant factors. If the violation leads to the issuance of a cessation order, a civil penalty shall be assessed. (2) When the department assesses a civil penalty, it shall inform the transporter of the amount of the penalty. The transporter shall then have 30 days to pay the penalty in full or, if the transporter wishes to contest either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, the transporter shall forward the proposed amount of the penalty to the department for placement in an escrow account with the State Treasurer or with a bank in this Commonwealth or post an appeal bond in the amount of the penalty. The bond must be executed by a surety licensed to do business in this Commonwealth and must be satisfactory to the department. If, through administrative or judicial review of the proposed penalty, it is determined that no violation occurred or that the amount of the penalty shall be reduced, the department shall, within 30 days, remit the appropriate amount to the transporter with any interest accumulated by the escrow deposit. Failure to forward the money or the appeal bond to the department within 30 days shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty. (3) The maximum civil penalty which may be assessed pursuant to this chapter is $10,000 per violation. Each violation for each separate day and each violation of any provision of the chapter, any regulation promulgated hereunder, any order issued under this chapter or the terms or conditions of any written authorization shall constitute a separate offense under this chapter. (4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, there shall be a statute of limitations of five years upon actions brought by the Commonwealth under this chapter. (c) Enforcement orders.-- (1) The department may issue orders to such transporters, counties and municipalities as it deems necessary to aid in the enforcement of this chapter. Such orders may include, but shall not be limited to, orders modifying, suspending or revoking written authorizations and orders requiring transporters, counties and municipalities to cease unlawful activities or operations of a waste transportation vehicle which in the course of operation is in violation of this chapter, any rule or regulation of the department or any terms and conditions of a written authorization issued under this chapter. An order issued under this chapter shall take effect upon notice unless the order specifies otherwise. An appeal to the Environmental Hearing Board shall not act as a supersedeas. The power of the department to issue an order under this chapter is in addition to any other remedy which may be afforded to the department pursuant to this chapter or any other act. (2) It shall be the duty of any transporter to proceed diligently to comply with any order issued pursuant to this section. If such transporter fails to proceed diligently or fails to comply with the order within such time, if any, as may be specified, such transporter commits contempt and shall be punished by the court in an appropriate manner, and for this purpose application may be made to the Commonwealth Court, which is hereby granted jurisdiction. (d) Injunctions.-- (1) In addition to any other remedies provided in this chapter, the department may institute a suit in equity in the name of the Commonwealth where unlawful conduct exists for an injunction to restrain a violation of this chapter, the regulations promulgated under this chapter, any order issued pursuant hereto or the terms or conditions of any written authorization. In any such proceeding, the court shall, upon the motion of the Commonwealth, issue a prohibitory or mandatory preliminary injunction if it finds that the defendant is engaging in unlawful conduct as defined by this chapter or is engaged in conduct which is causing immediate or irreparable harm to the public. The Commonwealth shall not be required to furnish bond or other security in connection with such proceedings. In addition to an injunction, the court in such equity proceedings may levy civil penalties as specified in this chapter. (2) In addition to any other remedies provided for in this chapter, an action in equity may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction to restrain any and all violations of this chapter or the regulations promulgated under this chapter. (3) Actions instituted under this section may be filed in the appropriate court of common pleas or in the Commonwealth Court, which courts are hereby granted jurisdiction to hear such actions. (e) Concurrent remedies.-- The penalties and remedies provided in this chapter shall be deemed concurrent and cumulative with all other existing provisions of law or equity. The existence or exercise of any remedy shall not prevent the department from exercising any other remedy under this chapter at any law or in equity. (f) Forfeiture of waste transportation vehicle.-- (1) A waste transportation vehicle shall be deemed contraband and forfeited to the department if it is transporting municipal or residual waste to a processing or disposal facility in this Commonwealth without a written authorization if the transporter applied for and was denied the written authorization for that vehicle. The waste transportation vehicle forfeiture provisions established in this subsection shall also apply to a waste transportation vehicle used by a transporter who, after receiving notice from the department to obtain written authorization, fails to obtain written authorization under the requirements of the Waste Transportation Safety Program. The provisions of law relating to seizure, summary and judicial forfeiture and condemnation of intoxicating liquor shall apply to seizures and forfeitures under this chapter. Proceeds from the sale of forfeited waste transportation vehicles shall be deposited in the Waste Transportation Safety Account. (2) The owner of any vehicle or conveyance forfeited under this chapter shall be responsible for any costs incurred in properly disposing of waste in the vehicle or conveyance. (g) Disposition.-- All fines and penalties collected under this section shall be paid into the Waste Transportation Safety Account.",

(a) Prisoner filing requirements.-- (1) A prisoner seeking to bring prison conditions litigation without the prepayment of fees or security due to indigency must submit a request to the court to proceed without the prepayment of fees. The request must include a certified copy of the prisoner's prison account statement, which shall be provided by the prison, for the six-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal. The request shall include a statement of any other assets of the prisoner. (2) The court shall deny in forma pauperis status to any prisoner where: (i) the request is not accompanied by a certified copy as provided in paragraph (1); (ii) the average monthly deposits or average highest monthly balance for the six-month period preceding the filing of the action exceeds the amount of the filing fee; or (iii) other grounds exist for the denial of in forma pauperis status pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. (b) Partial filing fees.-- (1) The court may grant in forma pauperis status to excuse the prisoner from paying the full filing fee prior to the initiation of the action or appeal. Where in forma pauperis status is granted, the court shall order the prisoner to pay the full amount of the filing fee and shall assess and, when funds exist, collect a full or partial payment of the filing fee which shall be the greater of the following: (i) The average monthly deposits to the prisoner's account. (ii) The average highest monthly balance in the prisoner's account for the six-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal requiring the payment of a fee. (2) The court shall send a copy of the assessment order to the prisoner, the parties to the action and the prison having custody of the prisoner. The court may also direct upon condition of maintaining the action that the prisoner make a written request to the prison officials to deduct payments required by the court. (3) The court may modify the assessment order for cause. (c) Payment of filing fees.-- Following payment of an initial partial filing fee, the prisoner shall make monthly payments of 20% of the preceding month's income credited to the prisoner's account. The prison having custody of the prisoner shall deduct payments from the prisoner's account when the prisoner's account balance exceeds $10 until the filing fees are paid in full. The prison shall forward to the prothonotary the deducted payments upon deduction, on a monthly basis, or upon complete payment of the full filing fee if the court so directs. The Department of Corrections and county prison systems shall develop written guidelines regarding the priority of payment, which shall be consistent with law. (d) Implementation of filing fee assessments.-- (1) A prisoner shall not be prohibited from filing prison conditions litigation because the prisoner has no assets or other means to pay the filing fee. This paragraph shall not prevent the court from dismissing or otherwise disposing of prison conditions litigation pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law. (2) No sooner than 60 days after notice of the denial in forma pauperis status or the assessment of partial filing fees, the prothonotary shall enter a judgment of non pros in the action or strike the appeal if the fees remain unpaid. The action or appeal may be reinstated by the court for good cause shown. (e) Dismissal of litigation.-- Notwithstanding any filing fee which has been paid, the court shall dismiss prison conditions litigation at any time, including prior to service on the defendant, if the court determines any of the following: (1) The allegation of indigency is untrue. (2) The prison conditions litigation is frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or the defendant is entitled to assert a valid affirmative defense, including immunity, which, if asserted, would preclude the relief. The court may reinstate the prison conditions litigation where the dismissal is based upon an untrue allegation of indigency and the prisoner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the untrue information was not known to the prisoner. (f) Abusive litigation.-- If the prisoner has previously filed prison conditions litigation and: (1) three or more of these prior civil actions have been dismissed pursuant to subsection (e)(2); or (2) the prisoner has previously filed prison conditions litigation against a person named as a defendant in the instant action or a person serving in the same official capacity as a named defendant and a court made a finding that the prior action was filed in bad faith or that the prisoner knowingly presented false evidence or testimony at a hearing or trial; the court may dismiss the action. The court shall not, however, dismiss a request for preliminary injunctive relief or a temporary restraining order which makes a credible allegation that the prisoner is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury.

(a) Prospective environmental response projects.-- (1) Unless waived by the department, engineering controls or institutional controls required to demonstrate attainment of a remediation standard under the Land Recycling Act or the act of July 6, 1989 (P.L.169, No.32), known as the Storage Tank and Spill Prevention Act, shall be in the form of an environmental covenant. (2) If a deed acknowledgment is required by section 405 of the act of July 7, 1980 (P.L.380, No.97), known as the Solid Waste Management Act, or section 512(b) of the act of October 18, 1988 (P.L.756, No.108), known as the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act, the requirement may be satisfied by reference to an environmental covenant recorded pursuant to this chapter. (3) An environmental covenant shall not be required for property owned by the Federal Government prior to transfer of the property to a non-Federal entity or individual. Activity and use limitations on Federal property shall be incorporated into an installation's master plan or other similar and appropriate remedial documentation. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit any authority otherwise available to the department to enforce terms of an environmental response project at a Federal installation or on property owned by the Federal Government. (b) Conversion to environmental covenant.-- (1) An instrument created prior to the effective date of this section which establishes activity and use limitations to demonstrate attainment or maintenance of a standard under the Land Recycling Act or to demonstrate satisfaction of a corrective action requirement under the Storage Tank and Spill Prevention Act shall be converted to an environmental covenant within 60 months of the effective date of this section unless conversion is waived by the department. (2) Failure to comply with this subsection does not invalidate the existing engineering controls and institutional controls described in paragraph (1) or preclude the conversion of those engineering controls and institutional controls to an environmental covenant at a later date.
