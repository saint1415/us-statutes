With respect to withdrawal uses, other than public water supply agency withdrawals and hydropower facilities, involving a withdrawal of less than 50,000 gallons per day in a 30-day period, the regulations shall provide for the use of alternative methods to obtain a reasonable estimate or indirect calculation of such in lieu of direct metering or measurement.\n\n(2) The regulations may provide for the adjustment of or variations in registration, recordkeeping or periodic reporting requirements for identified classification of user or volume of withdrawal if such requirements are not necessary to obtain information required to adequately assess water uses, monitor demands and otherwise prepare accurate and complete regional and State water plans and, if applicable, critical area resource plans.\n\n(3) The regulations shall include a process under which water users may document and register practices or projects that they have implemented to reduce water withdrawals or consumptive use, promote groundwater recharge or otherwise conserve or enhance water supplies for consideration and use in providing appropriate recognition and credit during the implementation of existing or future water supply programs.\n\n(4) To avoid duplication of efforts, regulations implementing the periodic reporting requirements of this subsection shall provide that the requirements may be satisfied by the filing of discharge monitoring reports prepared under the Clean Streams Law, water supply reports prepared under the Safe Drinking Water Act, water withdrawal and use reports prepared and submitted pursuant to regulations adopted by the Delaware River Basin Commission and Susquehanna River Basin Commission, or other reports submitted under other applicable statutes and regulations, to the extent that the reports provide the required information.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the department or the Environmental Quality Board to require metering of homeowner wells.\n\n(6) Where a registered withdrawal is terminated or is reduced to an amount which over a 12-month period is less than the 30-day average threshold amounts requiring registration, the person responsible for such withdrawal may file a written notice with the department of such termination and reduction. After filing such notice, the person shall be relieved of further obligations relating to period reporting under this section.\n\n(7) Persons required to register and report water withdrawals or uses under this section shall keep records required by regulation for a period of five years and make such records available for inspection by the department upon request.\n\n(8) Registration of a withdrawal or use shall not be construed as a determination of a person's water rights or approval of a withdrawal or use by any agency of the Commonwealth or by a Compact Basin Commission.\n\n(c) Confidentiality of information.--Information provided to the department under this section shall be subject to the provisions of section 3119 (relating to confidential information).\n\nCross References.Section 3118 is referred to in section 3131 of this title.",
