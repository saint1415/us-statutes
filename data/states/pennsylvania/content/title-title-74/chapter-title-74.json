(b) Request for proposals.-- After receiving the determination required by subsection (a), a public entity shall solicit proposals through a request for proposals. (c) Public notice.-- A public entity shall give public notice of a request for proposals consistent with regulations adopted by the department.

A public entity may establish procedures for the distribution of a request for proposals, including the imposition of a fee to reimburse the public entity for the costs of photocopying and mailing. (e) Receipt of proposals.-- Offerors shall submit their proposals to ensure that their proposals are received prior to the time and date established for receipt of the proposals. Proposals shall be submitted in the format required by the request for proposals. Proposals shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of their contents to competing offerors. (f) Evaluation.-- A public entity shall evaluate each proposal to determine which proposal has the best value for and is in the best interest of the public entity. In making this determination, a public entity may consider any of the following: (1) Cost. (2) Price. (3) Financial commitment. (4) Innovative financing. (5) Bonding. (6) Technical, scientific, technological or socioeconomic merit. (7) Financial strength and viability. (8) Design, operation and feasibility of the transportation project.

No individual who has been employed by an offeror within the last two years may participate in the evaluation of proposals. (i) Discussion with responsible offerors and revision of proposals.-- As provided in the request for proposals, discussions and negotiations may be conducted with responsible offerors for the purpose of clarification and of obtaining best and final offers. Responsible offers shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. (j) Selection for negotiation.-- The responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the best value for and in the best interests of the public entity, taking into consideration all evaluation factors, shall be selected for contract negotiation. (k) Cancellation.-- A request for proposals may be canceled at any time prior to the time a public-private transportation partnership agreement is executed by all parties when it is in the best interests of the public entity. (l) Award.-- Upon reaching an agreement with a responsible offeror, a public entity shall enter into a public-private transportation partnership agreement with the responsible offeror. The public-private transportation partnership agreement shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter. If agreement cannot be reached with the best qualified responsible offeror, then negotiations will be formally terminated with the offeror. If proposals were submitted by one or more other responsible offerors, negotiations may be conducted with the other responsible offeror or responsible offerors in the order of their respective qualification ranking. The contract may be awarded to the responsible offeror then ranked as best qualified. (m) Resolution of controversies involving the Commonwealth.-- If a prospective offeror, offeror or development entity is aggrieved by a selection under this section and the public entity or proprietary public entity in the invitation or contract is a Commonwealth agency, the prospective offeror, offeror or development entity may file a protest or a claim, as appropriate, in accordance with 62 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17 (relating to legal and contractual remedies). (n) Resolution of controversies not involving the Commonwealth.-- If a development entity is aggrieved by a selection under this section and the proprietary public entity in the contract is an entity other than the Commonwealth, a development entity may file a claim with the court of common pleas where the proprietary public entity is located. The process for the filing and resolution of claims, including rights, contents, timing, evaluation, determination and remedies, which are established in 62 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17, shall apply insofar as they are practicable. (July 11, 2022, P.L.1566, No.84, eff. imd.) 2022 Amendment. Act 84 amended subsec. (a). Cross References.

(ii) The preliminary adjusted amounts shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (b), (d) and (k). (4) In each successive year in which there is a positive percentage change in the CPI-U for the United States City Average, the positive percentage change shall be multiplied by the most recent preliminary adjusted amounts, and the products shall be added to the preliminary adjusted amount of the prior year to calculate the preliminary adjusted amounts for the current year. The sums thereof shall be rounded to the nearest $100 to determine the new final adjusted base amounts for purposes of subsections (b), (d) and (k). (5) The determinations and adjustments required under this subsection shall be made in the period between October 1 and November 15 of the year following the effective date of this subsection and annually between October 1 and November 15 of each year thereafter.

(a) Liability of owner.-- (1) If an operator of a vehicle fails to pay the prescribed toll at any location where tolls are collected by means of electronic toll collection, the owner of the vehicle shall be liable to the commission for failure of the operator of the vehicle to comply with this section if the violation is evidenced by information obtained from a toll collection system. (2) The registration plate number of the vehicle as recorded by a toll collection system shall establish an inference that the owner of the vehicle was then operating the vehicle. The inference shall be overcome if the owner provides a written statement indicating the following: (i) that the owner was not operating the vehicle at the time of travel; and (ii) (Deleted by amendment). (iii) (Deleted by amendment). (iv) the name and residence address of the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel. (3) Failure to send the required information within 30 days of the original invoice date shall result in the owner being liable for the total amount due. (4) If the inference is overcome, the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel may be held liable under this section for failure to pay the prescribed toll in the same manner as if the operator were the owner of the vehicle. (b) Imposition of liability.-- Liability under this section shall be imposed upon an owner for failure to pay the prescribed toll charges assessed under this section or the regulations of the commission occurring within the territorial limits of this Commonwealth. Based on evidence obtained by a toll collection system, the following shall apply: (1) The commission or an authorized agent or employee must prepare and mail an invoice assessing the toll charges incurred as follows: (i) The invoice must be sent by first class mail to each person alleged to be liable as an owner. (ii) The invoice must be mailed at the address shown on the vehicle registration or at the address of the operator, as applicable. The invoice must be mailed no later than 60 days after: (A) the date of travel; or (B) the date the inference is overcome under subsection (a)(2). (iii) Personal service is not required. (iv) The invoice must contain all of the following: (A) Information advising the person charged of the manner and time in which the toll charges in the invoice may be contested. (B) A warning advising the person charged that failure to contest the invoice in the manner and time provided shall be deemed an admission of liability for the total amount due. (1.1) A manual or automatic record of mailing prepared in the ordinary course of business shall be prima facie evidence of the mailing of the invoice. (1.2) If mail, other than unclaimed mail, is returned undelivered, the commission may obtain address information from sources, such as the United States Postal Service, debt collection services, reviews of telephone directories or related skip-tracing practices, to locate an alternative address for the vehicle owner or the address of the operator, as applicable. (2) If an owner of a vehicle or an owner that is a lessor of a vehicle receives an invoice under this section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to a police department as having been stolen, it shall be a defense to the allegation of liability that the vehicle had been reported to the police as having been stolen prior to the time the travel occurred and that the vehicle had not been recovered by the time of the travel. For purposes of asserting the defense under this paragraph, it shall be sufficient that a certified copy of the police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by first class mail to the commission within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the owner or lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section. (3) An owner that is a lessor of a vehicle as to which an invoice was issued under paragraph (1) shall not be liable for tolls assessed in the invoice if the owner sends to the commission a copy of the rental, lease or other contract document covering the vehicle on the date of travel, with the name and address of the lessee clearly legible to the commission, within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section. If the lessor complies with the provisions of this section, the lessee of the vehicle on the date of travel shall be deemed to be the owner of the vehicle for purposes of this section and shall be subject to liability for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice under this section. (4) A certified report or a facsimile report of an authorized agent or employee of the commission reporting a violation of this section or regulations of the commission based upon the recorded information obtained from a toll collection system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in the report and shall be admissible as an official record kept in the ordinary course of business in any proceeding charging a violation of this section or the toll collection regulations of the commission. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, videotapes, photographs, microphotographs, other recorded images, written records, reports or facsimiles prepared pursuant to this section shall be for the exclusive use of the commission, its authorized agents, its employees and law enforcement officials for the purpose of discharging duties under this section and the regulations of the commission. The information shall not be deemed a public record under the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law. The information shall not be discoverable by court order or otherwise; nor shall it be offered in evidence in any action or proceeding which is not directly related to a violation of this section, the regulations of the commission or indemnification for liability imposed pursuant to this section. The restrictions set forth in this paragraph: (i) shall not be deemed to preclude a court of competent jurisdiction from issuing an order directing that the information be provided to law enforcement officials if the information is reasonably described and is requested solely in connection with a criminal law enforcement action; (ii) shall not be deemed to preclude the exchange of the information between any entities with jurisdiction over or which operate a toll collection system in this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction; and (iii) shall not be deemed to prohibit the use of information exclusively for the purpose of billing electronic toll collection accounts, deducting toll charges from accounts, enforcing toll collection laws and related regulations or enforcing the provisions of accounts. (6) An imposition of liability under this section must be based upon a preponderance of evidence. (7) An imposition of liability pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a conviction of an owner and shall not be made part of the motor vehicle operating record of the person upon whom the liability is imposed, nor shall it be considered in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage. (8) An owner that admits, is found liable or fails to pay the invoice resulting in a violation of this section shall be civilly liable to the commission for all of the following: (i) Either: (A) the amount of the toll evaded or attempted to be evaded if the amount can be determined; or (B) the maximum toll from the farthest point of entry on the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the actual point of exit if the amount of the toll evaded or attempted to be evaded cannot be determined. (ii) A reasonable administrative fee not to exceed $35 per notification. (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of the operator of a vehicle for a violation of this section or of the regulations of the commission. (c) Placement of electronic toll collection device.-- An electronic toll collection device which is affixed to the front windshield of a vehicle in accordance with the regulations of the commission shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 4524 (relating to windshield obstructions and wipers). (d) Privacy of electronic toll collection information.-- (1) Except as set forth under paragraph (2), notwithstanding any other provision of law, all of the following apply to information kept by the commission, its authorized agents or its employees which is related to an account for electronic toll collection and any information collected by a toll collection system: (i) The information shall be for the exclusive use of the commission, its authorized agents, its employees and law enforcement officials for the purpose of discharging their duties pursuant to this section and the regulations of the commission. This subparagraph includes names, addresses, account numbers, account balances, personal financial information, vehicle movement records and other information compiled by a toll collection system. (ii) The information shall not be deemed a public record under the Right-to-Know Law, nor shall it be discoverable by court order or otherwise or be offered in evidence in any action or proceeding which is not directly related to the discharge of duties under this section, the regulations of the commission or a violation of the terms in an account. (2) Paragraph (1) shall not be deemed to do any of the following: (i) Preclude a court of competent jurisdiction from issuing an order directing that the information be provided to law enforcement officials if the information is reasonably described and is requested solely in connection with a criminal law enforcement action. (ii) Preclude the exchange of the information between any entities with jurisdiction over or which operate a toll collection system in this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction. (iii) Prohibit the use of the information exclusively for the purpose of billing electronic toll collection accounts, deducting toll charges from an account, enforcing toll collection laws and related regulations or enforcing the provisions of an account. (d.1) Notice for posting video toll or flat video toll to customer account.-- (1) The commission shall indicate on an account statement if a video toll has been posted to the customer's account, including the date and the dollar amount of the video toll. (2) The commission shall post notice on its publicly accessible Internet website indicating an account may be charged a flat video toll if the commission is unable to match a license plate image. (3) The commission shall notify the account upon the posting of the first flat video toll to the account in a calendar year in accordance with the preferences indicated in the account. The notification shall include: (i) Information on proper placement of the electronic toll collection device. (ii) Information regarding replacement of the electronic toll collection device. (iii) Notice that failure to respond may result in additional flat video tolls and administrative fees posted to the account. (iv) Other information as determined by the commission.

      "text": "§ 1786. Required financial responsibility. (a) General rule.-- Every motor vehicle of the type required to be registered under this title which is operated or currently registered shall be covered by financial responsibility. (b) Self-certification.-- The Department of Transportation shall require that each motor vehicle registrant certify that the registrant is financially responsible at the time of registration or renewal thereof. The department shall refuse to register or renew the registration of a vehicle for failure to comply with this requirement or falsification of self-certification. (c) Consent to produce proof of financial responsibility.-- Upon registering a motor vehicle or renewing a motor vehicle registration, the owner of the motor vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to produce proof, upon request, to the Department of Transportation or a police officer that the vehicle registrant has the financial responsibility required by this chapter. Proof of financial responsibility may be satisfied under this chapter by production of a financial responsibility identification card in paper or electronic form. If an owner of a motor vehicle is providing electronic proof of financial responsibility to a police officer, the police officer shall only view content that is reasonably necessary to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility. The owner of the electronic device assumes liability for any damage to the electronic device containing the financial responsibility identification card while in possession of the police officer or agents of the department. (d) Suspension of registration and operating privilege.-- (1) The Department of Transportation shall suspend the registration of a vehicle for a period of three months if it determines the required financial responsibility was not secured as required by this chapter and shall suspend the operating privilege of the owner or registrant for a period of three months if the department determines that the owner or registrant has operated or permitted the operation of the vehicle without the required financial responsibility. The operating privilege shall not be restored until the restoration fee for operating privilege provided by section 1960 (relating to reinstatement of operating privilege or vehicle registration) is paid. (1.1) In lieu of serving a registration suspension imposed under this section, an owner or registrant may pay to the department a civil penalty of $500, the restoration fee prescribed under section 1960 and furnish proof of financial responsibility in a manner determined by the department. An owner or registrant may exercise this option no more than once in a 12-month period. (2) Whenever the department revokes or suspends the registration of any vehicle under this chapter, the department shall not restore or transfer the registration until the suspension has been served or the civil penalty has been paid to the department and the vehicle owner furnishes proof of financial responsibility in a manner determined by the department and submits an application for registration to the department, accompanied by the fee for restoration of registration provided by section 1960. This subsection shall not apply in the following circumstances: (i) The owner or registrant proves to the satisfaction of the department that the lapse in financial responsibility coverage was for a period of less than 31 days and that the owner or registrant did not operate or permit the operation of the vehicle during the period of lapse in financial responsibility. (ii) The owner or registrant is a member of the armed services of the United States, the owner or registrant has previously had the financial responsibility required by this chapter, financial responsibility had lapsed while the owner or registrant was on temporary, emergency duty and the vehicle was not operated during the period of lapse in financial responsibility. The exemption granted by this paragraph shall continue for 30 days after the owner or registrant returns from duty as long as the vehicle is not operated until the required financial responsibility has been established. (iii) The insurance coverage has terminated or financial responsibility has lapsed simultaneously with or subsequent to expiration of a seasonal registration, as provided in section 1307(a.1) (relating to period of registration). (3) An owner whose vehicle registration has been suspended under this subsection shall have the same right of appeal under section 1377 (relating to judicial review) as provided for in cases of the suspension of vehicle registration for other purposes. The filing of the appeal shall act as a supersedeas, and the suspension shall not be imposed until determination of the matter as provided in section 1377. The court's scope of review in an appeal from a vehicle registration suspension shall be limited to determining whether: (i) the vehicle is registered or of a type that is required to be registered under this title; and (ii) there has been either notice to the department of a lapse, termination or cancellation in the financial responsibility coverage as required by law for that vehicle or that the owner, registrant or driver was requested to provide proof of financial responsibility to the department, a police officer or another driver and failed to do so. Notice to the department of the lapse, termination or cancellation or the failure to provide the requested proof of financial responsibility shall create a presumption that the vehicle lacked the requisite financial responsibility. This presumption may be overcome by producing clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was insured at all relevant times. (4) Where an owner or registrant's operating privilege has been suspended under this subsection, the owner or registrant shall have the same right of appeal under section 1550 (relating to judicial review) as provided for in cases of suspension for other reason. The court's scope of review in an appeal from an operating privilege suspension shall be limited to determining whether: (i) the vehicle was registered or of a type required to be registered under this title; and (ii) the owner or registrant operated or permitted the operation of the same vehicle when it was not covered by financial responsibility. The fact that an owner, registrant or operator of the motor vehicle failed to provide competent evidence of insurance or the fact that the department received notice of a lapse, termination or cancellation of insurance for the vehicle shall create a presumption that the vehicle lacked the requisite financial responsibility. This presumption may be overcome by producing clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was insured at the time that it was driven. (5) An alleged lapse, cancellation or termination of a policy of insurance by an insurer may only be challenged by requesting review by the Insurance Commissioner pursuant to Article XX of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.682, No.284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921. Proof that a timely request has been made to the Insurance Commissioner for such a review shall act as a supersedeas, staying the suspension of registration or operating privilege under this section pending a determination pursuant to section 2009(a) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921 or, in the event that further review at a hearing is requested by either party, a final order pursuant to section 2009(i) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (6) The civil penalty collected under paragraph (1.1) shall be deposited into the Public Transportation Trust Fund. (e) Obligations upon lapse, termination or cancellation of financial responsibility.-- (1) An owner of a motor vehicle who ceases to maintain financial responsibility on a registered vehicle shall not operate or permit operation of the vehicle in this Commonwealth until proof of the required financial responsibility has been provided to the Department of Transportation. (2) An insurer who has issued a contract of motor vehicle liability insurance, or any approved self-insurance entity, shall notify the department in a timely manner and in a method prescribed by the department's regulations. Upon request of an owner or registrant in the case of an appeal brought by an owner or registrant for suspension under this section, an insurer shall provide a copy of the notice of cancellation or a copy of the insurer's filing procedures with proof that the notice was written in the normal course of business and placed in the normal course of mailing. The department shall not be required to produce such copy or any other proof that notice of termination, lapse or cancellation was provided to the owner or registrant in order to satisfy the burden of proof in a proceeding under this section. (3) An insurer who has issued a contract of motor vehicle liability insurance and knows or has reason to believe that the contract is only for the purpose of providing proof of financial responsibility shall notify the department if the insurance has been canceled or terminated by the insured or by the insurer. The insurer shall notify the department not later than ten days following the effective date of the cancellation or termination. (4) A person who, after maintaining financial responsibility on the vehicle of another person, ceases to maintain such financial responsibility shall immediately notify the vehicle's owner who shall not operate, or permit operation of, the vehicle in this Commonwealth. (5) In the case of a person who leases any motor vehicle from a person engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles, the lessee shall sign a statement indicating that the required financial responsibility has been provided through the lessor or through the lessee's motor vehicle liability insurance policy coverage. The lessee shall submit the statement to the lessor. (f) Operation of a motor vehicle without required financial responsibility.-- Any owner of a motor vehicle for which the existence of financial responsibility is a requirement for its legal operation shall not operate the motor vehicle or permit it to be operated upon a highway of this Commonwealth without the financial responsibility required by this chapter. In addition to the penalties provided by subsection (d), any person who fails to comply with this subsection commits a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $300. (g) Defenses.-- (1) No person shall be convicted of failing to produce proof of financial responsibility under this subchapter or section 3743 (relating to accidents involving damage to attended vehicle or property) or 6308 (relating to investigation by police officers) if the person produces, at the office of the issuing authority within five days of the date of the violation, proof that he possessed the required financial responsibility at the time of the violation. (2) No person shall be penalized for maintaining a registered motor vehicle without financial responsibility under subsection (d) if, at the time insurance coverage terminated or financial responsibility lapsed, the registration plate and card were voluntarily surrendered to the department, a full agent designated by the department to accept voluntarily surrendered registration plates and cards pursuant to regulations promulgated by the department or a decentralized service agent appointed by the department. If a seasonal registration, as provided in section 1307(a.1), has been issued for the vehicle, return of the registration plate and card shall be required only if the insurance coverage terminates or financial responsibility lapses prior to the expiration of the seasonal registration. The department, a full agent or the decentralized service agent, as the case may be, shall issue a receipt showing the date that the registration plate and card were received. The designated full agent or the decentralized service agent shall return the registration plate and card to the department accompanied by a copy of the receipt. (h) Reinstatement of voluntarily surrendered registration plate and card.-- (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the original registration plate and card shall be canceled by the department and destroyed. Any person who voluntarily surrendered a registration plate and card pursuant to the provisions of subsection (g)(2) may obtain a substitute registration plate and card bearing a registration number other than that originally issued from the department, a designated full agent or a decentralized service agent, as the case may be. Proof of financial responsibility in a form approved by the department shall be submitted together with the receipt showing the registration plate and card were voluntarily surrendered. (2) Any registration plate issued under sections 1340 (relating to antique and classic plates) and 1341 (relating to special registration plates) shall be returned by the department to the owner of the motor vehicle upon receipt of proof of financial responsibility. (3) A full agent designated by the department to issue substitute temporary registration cards and plates following a voluntary surrender of registration cards and plates pursuant to regulations promulgated by the department or a decentralized service agent appointed by the department may be authorized to issue substitute temporary registration plates provided proof of financial responsibility and a copy of the receipt showing the original registration plate and card were voluntarily surrendered are furnished. The fees provided pursuant to sections 1929 (relating to replacement registration plates) and 1932 (relating to duplicate registration cards) shall not be charged if the original registration plate and card were canceled pursuant to paragraph (1).

(a) Eligible applicants.-- The following may apply for financial assistance for operating expenses under this section: (1) The governing body of a municipality or an instrumentality of a municipality. (2) A Commonwealth agency or instrumentality. (3) A local transportation organization. (b) Applications.-- In addition to information required under section 1507 (relating to application and approval process), an application for financial assistance under this section shall include the applicant's reasonable estimates of operating revenue and government subsidies sufficient to cover all projected operating expenses. (c) Distribution formula.-- (1) No later than 15 business days after the effective date of this section, the department shall forward to the Legislative Reference Bureau for publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin the base operating allocation for each local transportation organization. (1.1) For purposes of determining the amount of assistance available for distribution under this subsection, in addition to the amounts allocated under section 1506(e)(1)(relating to fund), an amount equal to the revenue in the Public Transportation Assistance Fund dedicated pursuant to law shall be included. (2) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, each qualifying local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance which shall consist of the following: (i) Its base operating allocation multiplied by 1.0506. (ii) An additional amount which shall be allocated based on the following distribution formula: (A) Twenty-five percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of passengers. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.25. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of passengers. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of passengers for all local transportation organizations. (B) Ten percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of senior passengers to offset free fares for senior passengers. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.10. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of senior passengers. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of senior passengers for all local transportation organizations. (C) Thirty-five percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of revenue vehicle hours. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.35. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of revenue vehicle hours. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total of the revenue vehicle hours for all local transportation organizations. (D) Thirty percent of the award amount shall be based on the number of revenue vehicle miles. The actual amount received by each local transportation organization under this clause shall be calculated as follows: (I) Multiply the total amount of funding available for distribution under this paragraph by 0.30. (II) Multiply the product under subclause (I) by the local transportation organization's number of revenue vehicle miles. (III) Divide the product under subclause (II) by the total number of revenue vehicle miles for all local transportation organizations. (3) For the 2007-2008 fiscal year, no local transportation organization shall receive total financial assistance under this subsection that would be more than 50% higher than the amount it receives under paragraph (2)(i). For each subsequent fiscal year, the increase in the total financial assistance provided to each local transportation organization shall not exceed 20% of the prior year allocation. (c.1) Minimum.-- No local transportation organization shall receive financial assistance under this section in an amount less than the amount received in the previous fiscal year. (d) Local match requirements.-- (1) For fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, except as provided under paragraph (2), financial assistance provided under this section shall be matched by local or private cash funding in an amount not less than the greater of: (i) 15% of the amount of the financial assistance being provided; or (ii) the amount required under former section 1311(d) (relating to use of funds distributed) for fiscal year 2006-2007. (2) Beginning in fiscal year 2007-2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, if the local matching funds provided are less than 15% of the amount of financial assistance received, the local transportation organization's required local matching funds shall increase annually in order to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). The local matching funds shall be increased annually by a minimum of 5% above the amount of local matching funds provided in the previous fiscal year unless a lesser amount is necessary to meet the 15% requirement set forth under paragraph (1)(i). (3) Eligible local matching funds shall consist only of cash contributions provided by one or more municipalities or counties. The amount of the match and the time period during which the match must continue to be available shall be specified in the financial assistance agreement. Funding provided by local and private entities, including advertising or naming rights, may qualify as local matching funds to the extent they provide for the cost of transit service that is open to the public. The following shall not be considered local matching funds: (i) Any form of transit operating revenue or other forms of transit income provided by the local transportation organization. (ii) Funds used to replace fares. (4) A municipality in a metropolitan area which is a member of a local transportation organization is authorized to provide annual financial assistance from current revenues to the local transportation organization of which it is a member or enter into a long-term agreement for payment of money to assist in defraying the costs of operation, maintenance and debt service of the local transportation organization or of a particular public transportation project of a local transportation organization. The obligation of a municipality under an agreement pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered to be a part of the indebtedness of the municipality, nor shall the obligation be deemed to impair the status of any indebtedness of the municipality which would otherwise be considered self-sustaining. (e) Performance reviews.-- (1) The department may conduct performance reviews of an award recipient under this section to determine the effectiveness of the financial assistance. Reviews shall be conducted at regular intervals as established by the department in consultation with the management of the award recipient. After completion of a review, the department shall issue a report that: (i) highlights exceptional performance and identifies any problems that need to be resolved; (ii) assesses performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of the financial assistance; (iii) makes recommendations on follow-up actions required to remedy any problem identified; and (iv) provides an action plan documenting who should perform the recommended actions and a time frame within which they should be performed. (2) The department shall deliver the report to the Governor, to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the Senate and to the chairman and minority chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives. The department's regulations shall contain a description of the impact on both the amount of, and future eligibility for, financial assistance under this chapter based upon the degree to which the local transportation organization complies with the recommendations in the report. The department shall develop a list of best practices revealed by the reports issued under this subsection and shall post them on the department's Internet website. (f) Performance criteria.-- Criteria used for the reviews conducted under subsection (e) shall consist of passengers per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per revenue vehicle hour, operating revenue per revenue vehicle hour, operating costs per passenger and other items as the department may establish. The department's regulations shall set forth the minimum system performance criteria based upon comparison of the award recipient to its past performance and to its peers that an award recipient must satisfy. (g) Failure to satisfy minimum performance criteria.-- (1) If a performance review conducted under subsection (e) reveals that the performance of an award recipient's transportation system has decreased compared to performance determined through a prior review, the department may, upon the written request of an award recipient, waive any requirement for a reduction in the amount of financial assistance to be awarded under this section for a reasonable time period to allow the award recipient to bring the system back to the required performance level. The award recipient shall provide written justification for providing a time period longer than two years. In order to obtain the waiver for the period requested, the award recipient must do all of the following: (i) Develop an action plan to improve system performance that contains key measurable milestones. The action plan must be acceptable to the department and must be approved by the department in writing. (ii) Submit quarterly progress reports on the action plan to the department. (2) The department shall review and evaluate the award recipient's progress to determine if the system has improved. If the system has improved, the award recipient will remain eligible for full formula funding as determined under subsection (c). If the system has not improved by the end of the waiver period, the waiver will be withdrawn. Expenses incurred by the award recipient as a result of the failure of the award recipient's system to meet the minimum performance criteria shall be borne by the award recipient. (h) Adjustments to minimum performance criteria.-- Upon written request of an award recipient, the department may adjust the minimum performance criteria described in subsection (g) in a given year if the performance of the award recipient's system is adversely affected by circumstances which are beyond the award recipient's control. Examples are labor strikes, infrastructure failures and natural disasters. The request must include the award recipient's reasons for seeking the adjustment. Cross References.

(b) Examination of applicants for renewal.-- The department may require persons applying for renewal of a driver's license to take and successfully pass a physical examination or a vision examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist, or both examinations, if the department has reason to believe, either based on knowledge of the person or on statistical inference, that the person may be a traffic safety hazard.

(b) Nonresident.-- The nonresident owner of a motor vehicle not registered in this Commonwealth may give proof of financial responsibility by filing with the department a written certificate or certificates of an insurance company authorized to transact business in the state in which the motor vehicle or motor vehicles described in the certificate are registered or, if the nonresident does not own a motor vehicle, then evidence satisfactory to the department that the person does not own a motor vehicle. The department shall accept the certificate upon condition that the insurance company complies with the following provisions with respect to the policies so certified: (1) The insurance company shall execute a power of attorney authorizing the department to accept service on its behalf or process in any action arising out of a motor vehicle accident in this Commonwealth. (2) The insurance company shall agree in writing that the policies shall be deemed to conform with the laws of this Commonwealth relating to the terms of motor vehicle liability policies issued in this Commonwealth. (c) Default by foreign insurance company.-- If any insurance company not authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth, which has qualified to furnish proof of financial responsibility, defaults in any undertakings or agreements, the department shall not thereafter accept as proof any certificate of the company whether theretofore filed or thereafter tendered as proof as long as the default continues. (d) Financial responsibility identification cards.-- Insurers shall provide financial responsibility identification cards to insureds which shall be valid only for the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured. If the insured and insurer both agree, the insurer may issue the financial responsibility identification card solely in electronic format. Financial responsibility identification cards shall disclose the period for which coverage has been paid by the insured and shall contain such other information as required by the Insurance Department. In such instance where the insured has financed premiums through a premium finance company or where the insured is on an insurer-sponsored or agency-sponsored payment plan, financial responsibility identification cards may be issued for periods of six months even though such payment by the insured may be for a period of less than six months. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the immediate issuance of financial responsibility identification cards where an insured replaces an insured vehicle, adds a vehicle or increases coverages under an existing policy for which a premium adjustment is required. (e) Immunity.-- If an insured chooses to provide proof of financial responsibility to be viewed in an electronic format on an electronic device pursuant to section 1786 (relating to required financial responsibility), a police officer administering in good faith this subchapter shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability which arises from the insured's choice, including the inadvertent viewing of materials on the device other than the proof of financial responsibility, inadvertent deletion of information from the device, inadvertent interception of a communication while in possession of the device and breakage which occurs to the device.

(c) Consent to produce proof of financial responsibility.-- Upon registering a motor vehicle or renewing a motor vehicle registration, the owner of the motor vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to produce proof, upon request, to the Department of Transportation or a police officer that the vehicle registrant has the financial responsibility required by this chapter. Proof of financial responsibility may be satisfied under this chapter by production of a financial responsibility identification card in paper or electronic form. If an owner of a motor vehicle is providing electronic proof of financial responsibility to a police officer, the police officer shall only view content that is reasonably necessary to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility. The owner of the electronic device assumes liability for any damage to the electronic device containing the financial responsibility identification card while in possession of the police officer or agents of the department. (d) Suspension of registration and operating privilege.-- (1) The Department of Transportation shall suspend the registration of a vehicle for a period of three months if it determines the required financial responsibility was not secured as required by this chapter and shall suspend the operating privilege of the owner or registrant for a period of three months if the department determines that the owner or registrant has operated or permitted the operation of the vehicle without the required financial responsibility. The operating privilege shall not be restored until the restoration fee for operating privilege provided by section 1960 (relating to reinstatement of operating privilege or vehicle registration) is paid. (1.1) In lieu of serving a registration suspension imposed under this section, an owner or registrant may pay to the department a civil penalty of $500, the restoration fee prescribed under section 1960 and furnish proof of financial responsibility in a manner determined by the department. An owner or registrant may exercise this option no more than once in a 12-month period. (2) Whenever the department revokes or suspends the registration of any vehicle under this chapter, the department shall not restore or transfer the registration until the suspension has been served or the civil penalty has been paid to the department and the vehicle owner furnishes proof of financial responsibility in a manner determined by the department and submits an application for registration to the department, accompanied by the fee for restoration of registration provided by section 1960. This subsection shall not apply in the following circumstances: (i) The owner or registrant proves to the satisfaction of the department that the lapse in financial responsibility coverage was for a period of less than 31 days and that the owner or registrant did not operate or permit the operation of the vehicle during the period of lapse in financial responsibility. (ii) The owner or registrant is a member of the armed services of the United States, the owner or registrant has previously had the financial responsibility required by this chapter, financial responsibility had lapsed while the owner or registrant was on temporary, emergency duty and the vehicle was not operated during the period of lapse in financial responsibility. The exemption granted by this paragraph shall continue for 30 days after the owner or registrant returns from duty as long as the vehicle is not operated until the required financial responsibility has been established. (iii) The insurance coverage has terminated or financial responsibility has lapsed simultaneously with or subsequent to expiration of a seasonal registration, as provided in section 1307(a.1) (relating to period of registration). (3) An owner whose vehicle registration has been suspended under this subsection shall have the same right of appeal under section 1377 (relating to judicial review) as provided for in cases of the suspension of vehicle registration for other purposes. The filing of the appeal shall act as a supersedeas, and the suspension shall not be imposed until determination of the matter as provided in section 1377. The court's scope of review in an appeal from a vehicle registration suspension shall be limited to determining whether: (i) the vehicle is registered or of a type that is required to be registered under this title; and (ii) there has been either notice to the department of a lapse, termination or cancellation in the financial responsibility coverage as required by law for that vehicle or that the owner, registrant or driver was requested to provide proof of financial responsibility to the department, a police officer or another driver and failed to do so. Notice to the department of the lapse, termination or cancellation or the failure to provide the requested proof of financial responsibility shall create a presumption that the vehicle lacked the requisite financial responsibility. This presumption may be overcome by producing clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was insured at all relevant times. (4) Where an owner or registrant's operating privilege has been suspended under this subsection, the owner or registrant shall have the same right of appeal under section 1550 (relating to judicial review) as provided for in cases of suspension for other reason. The court's scope of review in an appeal from an operating privilege suspension shall be limited to determining whether: (i) the vehicle was registered or of a type required to be registered under this title; and (ii) the owner or registrant operated or permitted the operation of the same vehicle when it was not covered by financial responsibility. The fact that an owner, registrant or operator of the motor vehicle failed to provide competent evidence of insurance or the fact that the department received notice of a lapse, termination or cancellation of insurance for the vehicle shall create a presumption that the vehicle lacked the requisite financial responsibility. This presumption may be overcome by producing clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was insured at the time that it was driven. (5) An alleged lapse, cancellation or termination of a policy of insurance by an insurer may only be challenged by requesting review by the Insurance Commissioner pursuant to Article XX of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L.682, No.284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921. Proof that a timely request has been made to the Insurance Commissioner for such a review shall act as a supersedeas, staying the suspension of registration or operating privilege under this section pending a determination pursuant to section 2009(a) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921 or, in the event that further review at a hearing is requested by either party, a final order pursuant to section 2009(i) of The Insurance Company Law of 1921. (6) The civil penalty collected under paragraph (1.1) shall be deposited into the Public Transportation Trust Fund. (e) Obligations upon lapse, termination or cancellation of financial responsibility.-- (1) An owner of a motor vehicle who ceases to maintain financial responsibility on a registered vehicle shall not operate or permit operation of the vehicle in this Commonwealth until proof of the required financial responsibility has been provided to the Department of Transportation. (2) An insurer who has issued a contract of motor vehicle liability insurance, or any approved self-insurance entity, shall notify the department in a timely manner and in a method prescribed by the department's regulations. Upon request of an owner or registrant in the case of an appeal brought by an owner or registrant for suspension under this section, an insurer shall provide a copy of the notice of cancellation or a copy of the insurer's filing procedures with proof that the notice was written in the normal course of business and placed in the normal course of mailing. The department shall not be required to produce such copy or any other proof that notice of termination, lapse or cancellation was provided to the owner or registrant in order to satisfy the burden of proof in a proceeding under this section. (3) An insurer who has issued a contract of motor vehicle liability insurance and knows or has reason to believe that the contract is only for the purpose of providing proof of financial responsibility shall notify the department if the insurance has been canceled or terminated by the insured or by the insurer. The insurer shall notify the department not later than ten days following the effective date of the cancellation or termination. (4) A person who, after maintaining financial responsibility on the vehicle of another person, ceases to maintain such financial responsibility shall immediately notify the vehicle's owner who shall not operate, or permit operation of, the vehicle in this Commonwealth. (5) In the case of a person who leases any motor vehicle from a person engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles, the lessee shall sign a statement indicating that the required financial responsibility has been provided through the lessor or through the lessee's motor vehicle liability insurance policy coverage. The lessee shall submit the statement to the lessor. (f) Operation of a motor vehicle without required financial responsibility.-- Any owner of a motor vehicle for which the existence of financial responsibility is a requirement for its legal operation shall not operate the motor vehicle or permit it to be operated upon a highway of this Commonwealth without the financial responsibility required by this chapter. In addition to the penalties provided by subsection (d), any person who fails to comply with this subsection commits a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $300. (g) Defenses.-- (1) No person shall be convicted of failing to produce proof of financial responsibility under this subchapter or section 3743 (relating to accidents involving damage to attended vehicle or property) or 6308 (relating to investigation by police officers) if the person produces, at the office of the issuing authority within five days of the date of the violation, proof that he possessed the required financial responsibility at the time of the violation. (2) No person shall be penalized for maintaining a registered motor vehicle without financial responsibility under subsection (d) if, at the time insurance coverage terminated or financial responsibility lapsed, the registration plate and card were voluntarily surrendered to the department, a full agent designated by the department to accept voluntarily surrendered registration plates and cards pursuant to regulations promulgated by the department or a decentralized service agent appointed by the department. If a seasonal registration, as provided in section 1307(a.1), has been issued for the vehicle, return of the registration plate and card shall be required only if the insurance coverage terminates or financial responsibility lapses prior to the expiration of the seasonal registration. The department, a full agent or the decentralized service agent, as the case may be, shall issue a receipt showing the date that the registration plate and card were received. The designated full agent or the decentralized service agent shall return the registration plate and card to the department accompanied by a copy of the receipt. (h) Reinstatement of voluntarily surrendered registration plate and card.-- (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the original registration plate and card shall be canceled by the department and destroyed. Any person who voluntarily surrendered a registration plate and card pursuant to the provisions of subsection (g)(2) may obtain a substitute registration plate and card bearing a registration number other than that originally issued from the department, a designated full agent or a decentralized service agent, as the case may be. Proof of financial responsibility in a form approved by the department shall be submitted together with the receipt showing the registration plate and card were voluntarily surrendered. (2) Any registration plate issued under sections 1340 (relating to antique and classic plates) and 1341 (relating to special registration plates) shall be returned by the department to the owner of the motor vehicle upon receipt of proof of financial responsibility. (3) A full agent designated by the department to issue substitute temporary registration cards and plates following a voluntary surrender of registration cards and plates pursuant to regulations promulgated by the department or a decentralized service agent appointed by the department may be authorized to issue substitute temporary registration plates provided proof of financial responsibility and a copy of the receipt showing the original registration plate and card were voluntarily surrendered are furnished. The fees provided pursuant to sections 1929 (relating to replacement registration plates) and 1932 (relating to duplicate registration cards) shall not be charged if the original registration plate and card were canceled pursuant to paragraph (1).

A variance shall only be granted after the requirements of section 5919 (relating to notice to department) are satisfied.

(2) With any Federal agency that, if the Federal agency contributes funds to support any projects needed for the implementation of this subchapter, the Commonwealth will not alter or limit the rights and powers of the airport owner in a manner which would be inconsistent with the due performance of any agreement between the airport owner and a Federal agency of which the Commonwealth has knowledge.

(a) Imposition.-- There is hereby imposed, effective July 1, 1984, a State tax of 1.1¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, on all fuels used or sold and delivered by distributors within this Commonwealth for use as fuel in turbine-propeller jet, turbojet and jet-driven aircraft and aircraft engines. The tax shall be increased by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective January 1, 1985, and by 0.2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, effective July 1, 1985. Distributors shall be liable to the Commonwealth for the collection and payment of the tax imposed by this section. The tax shall be collected by the distributor and shall be paid to the Commonwealth only once with respect to any fuels. (b) Annual adjustment.-- Beginning on January 1, 1986, and each January 1 thereafter, the tax imposed under this section shall be adjusted annually and shall be set for that calendar year. The adjustment shall be based upon the percentage change of the Producer Price Index for Jet Fuel, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States Department of Labor, for the most recent 12-month period available as of the immediately preceding November 1. For every 10% increase or decrease in the Producer Price Index, as determined by comparing the index for the first month of the 12-month period with the index for the last month of the period, there shall be a 0.1¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, increase or decrease in the rate of tax. The rate of tax shall be determined by the Secretary of Revenue, who shall cause such rate to be published as a notice pursuant to 45 Pa.C.S. § 725(a)(3) (relating to additional contents of Pennsylvania Bulletin) in the Pennsylvania Bulletin on or before December 15 of each year. The tax, as adjusted, shall never exceed 2¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof, nor shall it be less than 1.5¢ per gallon, or fractional part thereof. (c) Construction of section.-- This section shall be construed in conjunction with the act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, as if jet fuels were liquid fuels as defined in that act, and all of the provisions of that act, except for section 4 thereof to the extent it imposes any tax, shall apply to the collection, administration and enforcement of the tax imposed under this section. Upon the effective date of the tax imposed by this section upon jet fuels, such jet fuels shall not be subject to the tax imposed by the act of January 14, 1952 (1951 P.L.1965, No.550), known as the Fuel Use Tax Act, except that dealer-users shall remain liable to report and pay the fuel use tax on any jet fuels used thereafter upon which the tax provided by this section has not been imposed. (d) Disposition of taxes.-- All moneys collected under this section shall be deposited by the State Treasurer in the Aviation Restricted Account. Effective Date of Tax. Section 4 of Act 164 of 1984 provided that, if Act 164 was not finally enacted on or before July 1, 1984, the tax imposed under section 6131 shall not be effective as of July 1, 1984, but shall be effective on the first day of the first month following final enactment (November 1, 1984). References in Text. The act of May 21, 1931 (P.L.149, No.105), known as The Liquid Fuels Tax Act, referred to in subsec. (c), was repealed by the act of April 17, 1997 (P.L.6, No.3).

(a) Liability of owner.-- (1) If an operator of a vehicle fails to pay the prescribed toll at any location where tolls are collected by means of electronic toll collection, the owner of the vehicle shall be liable to the commission for failure of the operator of the vehicle to comply with this section if the violation is evidenced by information obtained from a toll collection system. (2) The registration plate number of the vehicle as recorded by a toll collection system shall establish an inference that the owner of the vehicle was then operating the vehicle. The inference shall be overcome if the owner provides a written statement indicating the following: (i) that the owner was not operating the vehicle at the time of travel; and (ii) (Deleted by amendment). (iii) (Deleted by amendment). (iv) the name and residence address of the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel. (3) Failure to send the required information within 30 days of the original invoice date shall result in the owner being liable for the total amount due. (4) If the inference is overcome, the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel may be held liable under this section for failure to pay the prescribed toll in the same manner as if the operator were the owner of the vehicle. (b) Imposition of liability.-- Liability under this section shall be imposed upon an owner for failure to pay the prescribed toll charges assessed under this section or the regulations of the commission occurring within the territorial limits of this Commonwealth. Based on evidence obtained by a toll collection system, the following shall apply: (1) The commission or an authorized agent or employee must prepare and mail an invoice assessing the toll charges incurred as follows: (i) The invoice must be sent by first class mail to each person alleged to be liable as an owner. (ii) The invoice must be mailed at the address shown on the vehicle registration or at the address of the operator, as applicable. The invoice must be mailed no later than 60 days after: (A) the date of travel; or (B) the date the inference is overcome under subsection (a)(2). (iii) Personal service is not required. (iv) The invoice must contain all of the following: (A) Information advising the person charged of the manner and time in which the toll charges in the invoice may be contested. (B) A warning advising the person charged that failure to contest the invoice in the manner and time provided shall be deemed an admission of liability for the total amount due. (1.1) A manual or automatic record of mailing prepared in the ordinary course of business shall be prima facie evidence of the mailing of the invoice. (1.2) If mail, other than unclaimed mail, is returned undelivered, the commission may obtain address information from sources, such as the United States Postal Service, debt collection services, reviews of telephone directories or related skip-tracing practices, to locate an alternative address for the vehicle owner or the address of the operator, as applicable. (2) If an owner of a vehicle or an owner that is a lessor of a vehicle receives an invoice under this section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to a police department as having been stolen, it shall be a defense to the allegation of liability that the vehicle had been reported to the police as having been stolen prior to the time the travel occurred and that the vehicle had not been recovered by the time of the travel. For purposes of asserting the defense under this paragraph, it shall be sufficient that a certified copy of the police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by first class mail to the commission within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the owner or lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section. (3) An owner that is a lessor of a vehicle as to which an invoice was issued under paragraph (1) shall not be liable for tolls assessed in the invoice if the owner sends to the commission a copy of the rental, lease or other contract document covering the vehicle on the date of travel, with the name and address of the lessee clearly legible to the commission, within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section. If the lessor complies with the provisions of this section, the lessee of the vehicle on the date of travel shall be deemed to be the owner of the vehicle for purposes of this section and shall be subject to liability for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice under this section. (4) A certified report or a facsimile report of an authorized agent or employee of the commission reporting a violation of this section or regulations of the commission based upon the recorded information obtained from a toll collection system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in the report and shall be admissible as an official record kept in the ordinary course of business in any proceeding charging a violation of this section or the toll collection regulations of the commission. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, videotapes, photographs, microphotographs, other recorded images, written records, reports or facsimiles prepared pursuant to this section shall be for the exclusive use of the commission, its authorized agents, its employees and law enforcement officials for the purpose of discharging duties under this section and the regulations of the commission. The information shall not be deemed a public record under the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law. The information shall not be discoverable by court order or otherwise; nor shall it be offered in evidence in any action or proceeding which is not directly related to a violation of this section, the regulations of the commission or indemnification for liability imposed pursuant to this section. The restrictions set forth in this paragraph: (i) shall not be deemed to preclude a court of competent jurisdiction from issuing an order directing that the information be provided to law enforcement officials if the information is reasonably described and is requested solely in connection with a criminal law enforcement action; (ii) shall not be deemed to preclude the exchange of the information between any entities with jurisdiction over or which operate a toll collection system in this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction; and (iii) shall not be deemed to prohibit the use of information exclusively for the purpose of billing electronic toll collection accounts, deducting toll charges from accounts, enforcing toll collection laws and related regulations or enforcing the provisions of accounts. (6) An imposition of liability under this section must be based upon a preponderance of evidence. (7) An imposition of liability pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a conviction of an owner and shall not be made part of the motor vehicle operating record of the person upon whom the liability is imposed, nor shall it be considered in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage. (8) An owner that admits, is found liable or fails to pay the invoice resulting in a violation of this section shall be civilly liable to the commission for all of the following: (i) Either: (A) the amount of the toll evaded or attempted to be evaded if the amount can be determined; or (B) the maximum toll from the farthest point of entry on the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the actual point of exit if the amount of the toll evaded or attempted to be evaded cannot be determined. (ii) A reasonable administrative fee not to exceed $35 per notification. (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of the operator of a vehicle for a violation of this section or of the regulations of the commission. (c) Placement of electronic toll collection device.-- An electronic toll collection device which is affixed to the front windshield of a vehicle in accordance with the regulations of the commission shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 4524 (relating to windshield obstructions and wipers). (d) Privacy of electronic toll collection information.-- (1) Except as set forth under paragraph (2), notwithstanding any other provision of law, all of the following apply to information kept by the commission, its authorized agents or its employees which is related to an account for electronic toll collection and any information collected by a toll collection system: (i) The information shall be for the exclusive use of the commission, its authorized agents, its employees and law enforcement officials for the purpose of discharging their duties pursuant to this section and the regulations of the commission. This subparagraph includes names, addresses, account numbers, account balances, personal financial information, vehicle movement records and other information compiled by a toll collection system. (ii) The information shall not be deemed a public record under the Right-to-Know Law, nor shall it be discoverable by court order or otherwise or be offered in evidence in any action or proceeding which is not directly related to the discharge of duties under this section, the regulations of the commission or a violation of the terms in an account. (2) Paragraph (1) shall not be deemed to do any of the following: (i) Preclude a court of competent jurisdiction from issuing an order directing that the information be provided to law enforcement officials if the information is reasonably described and is requested solely in connection with a criminal law enforcement action. (ii) Preclude the exchange of the information between any entities with jurisdiction over or which operate a toll collection system in this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction. (iii) Prohibit the use of the information exclusively for the purpose of billing electronic toll collection accounts, deducting toll charges from an account, enforcing toll collection laws and related regulations or enforcing the provisions of an account. (d.1) Notice for posting video toll or flat video toll to customer account.-- (1) The commission shall indicate on an account statement if a video toll has been posted to the customer's account, including the date and the dollar amount of the video toll.

(b) Request for proposals.-- After receiving the determination required by subsection (a), a public entity shall solicit proposals through a request for proposals. (c) Public notice.-- A public entity shall give public notice of a request for proposals consistent with regulations adopted by the department. The notice shall be given a reasonable time prior to the date set for the close of receipt of the proposals.

In making this determination, a public entity may consider any of the following: (1) Cost. (2) Price. (3) Financial commitment. (4) Innovative financing. (5) Bonding. (6) Technical, scientific, technological or socioeconomic merit. (7) Financial strength and viability. (8) Design, operation and feasibility of the transportation project.

No individual who has been employed by an offeror within the last two years may participate in the evaluation of proposals. (i) Discussion with responsible offerors and revision of proposals.-- As provided in the request for proposals, discussions and negotiations may be conducted with responsible offerors for the purpose of clarification and of obtaining best and final offers. Responsible offers shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. (j) Selection for negotiation.-- The responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the best value for and in the best interests of the public entity, taking into consideration all evaluation factors, shall be selected for contract negotiation. (k) Cancellation.-- A request for proposals may be canceled at any time prior to the time a public-private transportation partnership agreement is executed by all parties when it is in the best interests of the public entity. (l) Award.-- Upon reaching an agreement with a responsible offeror, a public entity shall enter into a public-private transportation partnership agreement with the responsible offeror. The public-private transportation partnership agreement shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter. If agreement cannot be reached with the best qualified responsible offeror, then negotiations will be formally terminated with the offeror. If proposals were submitted by one or more other responsible offerors, negotiations may be conducted with the other responsible offeror or responsible offerors in the order of their respective qualification ranking. The contract may be awarded to the responsible offeror then ranked as best qualified. (m) Resolution of controversies involving the Commonwealth.-- If a prospective offeror, offeror or development entity is aggrieved by a selection under this section and the public entity or proprietary public entity in the invitation or contract is a Commonwealth agency, the prospective offeror, offeror or development entity may file a protest or a claim, as appropriate, in accordance with 62 Pa.C.S. Ch. 17 (relating to legal and contractual remedies). (n) Resolution of controversies not involving the Commonwealth.-- If a development entity is aggrieved by a selection under this section and the proprietary public entity in the contract is an entity other than the Commonwealth, a development entity may file a claim with the court of common pleas where the proprietary public entity is located. The process for the filing and resolution of claims, including rights, contents, timing, evaluation, determination and remedies, which are established in 62 Pa.C.S.
