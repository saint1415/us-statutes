The inference shall be overcome if the owner provides a written statement indicating the following:\n\n(i) that the owner was not operating the vehicle at the time of travel; and\n\n(ii) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(iii) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(iv) the name and residence address of the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel.\n\n(3) Failure to send the required information within 30 days of the original invoice date shall result in the owner being liable for the total amount due.\n\n(4) If the inference is overcome, the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel may be held liable under this section for failure to pay the prescribed toll in the same manner as if the operator were the owner of the vehicle.\n\n(b) Imposition of liability.--Liability under this section shall be imposed upon an owner for failure to pay the prescribed toll charges assessed under this section or the regulations of the commission occurring within the territorial limits of this Commonwealth. Based on evidence obtained by a toll collection system, the following shall apply:\n\n(1) The commission or an authorized agent or employee must prepare and mail an invoice assessing the toll charges incurred as follows:\n\n(i) The invoice must be sent by first class mail to each person alleged to be liable as an owner.\n\n(ii) The invoice must be mailed at the address shown on the vehicle registration or at the address of the operator, as applicable. The invoice must be mailed no later than 60 days after:\n\n(A) the date of travel; or\n\n(B) the date the inference is overcome under subsection (a)(2).\n\n(iii) Personal service is not required.\n\n(iv) The invoice must contain all of the following:\n\n(A) Information advising the person charged of the manner and time in which the toll charges in the invoice may be contested.\n\n(B) A warning advising the person charged that failure to contest the invoice in the manner and time provided shall be deemed an admission of liability for the total amount due.\n\n(1.1) A manual or automatic record of mailing prepared in the ordinary course of business shall be prima facie evidence of the mailing of the invoice.\n\n(1.2) If mail, other than unclaimed mail, is returned undelivered, the commission may obtain address information from sources, such as the United States Postal Service, debt collection services, reviews of telephone directories or related skip-tracing practices, to locate an alternative address for the vehicle owner or the address of the operator, as applicable.\n\n(2) If an owner of a vehicle or an owner that is a lessor of a vehicle receives an invoice under this section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to a police department as having been stolen, it shall be a defense to the allegation of liability that the vehicle had been reported to the police as having been stolen prior to the time the travel occurred and that the vehicle had not been recovered by the time of the travel. For purposes of asserting the defense under this paragraph, it shall be sufficient that a certified copy of the police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by first class mail to the commission within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the owner or lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section.\n\n(3) An owner that is a lessor of a vehicle as to which an invoice was issued under paragraph (1) shall not be liable for tolls assessed in the invoice if the owner sends to the commission a copy of the rental, lease or other contract document covering the vehicle on the date of travel, with the name and address of the lessee clearly legible to the commission, within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section. If the lessor complies with the provisions of this section, the lessee of the vehicle on the date of travel shall be deemed to be the owner of the vehicle for purposes of this section and shall be subject to liability for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice under this section.\n\n(4) A certified report or a facsimile report of an authorized agent or employee of the commission reporting a violation of this section or regulations of the commission based upon the recorded information obtained from a toll collection system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in the report and shall be admissible as an official record kept in the ordinary course of business in any proceeding charging a violation of this section or the toll collection regulations of the commission.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, videotapes, photographs, microphotographs, other recorded images, written records, reports or facsimiles prepared pursuant to this section shall be for the exclusive use of the commission, its authorized agents, its employees and law enforcement officials for the purpose of discharging duties under this section and the regulations of the commission.
