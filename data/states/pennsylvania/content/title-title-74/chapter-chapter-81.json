The inference shall be overcome if the owner provides a written statement indicating the following:\n\n(i) that the owner was not operating the vehicle at the time of travel; and\n\n(ii) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(iii) (Deleted by amendment).\n\n(iv) the name and residence address of the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel.\n\n(3) Failure to send the required information within 30 days of the original invoice date shall result in the owner being liable for the total amount due.\n\n(4) If the inference is overcome, the operator of the vehicle at the time of travel may be held liable under this section for failure to pay the prescribed toll in the same manner as if the operator were the owner of the vehicle.\n\n(b) Imposition of liability.--Liability under this section shall be imposed upon an owner for failure to pay the prescribed toll charges assessed under this section or the regulations of the commission occurring within the territorial limits of this Commonwealth. Based on evidence obtained by a toll collection system, the following shall apply:\n\n(1) The commission or an authorized agent or employee must prepare and mail an invoice assessing the toll charges incurred as follows:\n\n(i) The invoice must be sent by first class mail to each person alleged to be liable as an owner.\n\n(ii) The invoice must be mailed at the address shown on the vehicle registration or at the address of the operator, as applicable.

For purposes of asserting the defense under this paragraph, it shall be sufficient that a certified copy of the police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by first class mail to the commission within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the owner or lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section.\n\n(3) An owner that is a lessor of a vehicle as to which an invoice was issued under paragraph (1) shall not be liable for tolls assessed in the invoice if the owner sends to the commission a copy of the rental, lease or other contract document covering the vehicle on the date of travel, with the name and address of the lessee clearly legible to the commission, within 30 days after receiving the original invoice. Failure to send the information within the time limit under this paragraph shall render the lessor liable for the tolls and fees assessed in the invoice as prescribed by this section.
