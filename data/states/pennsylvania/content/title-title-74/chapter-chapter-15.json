The award recipient shall provide written justification for providing a time period longer than two years.

The action plan must be acceptable to the department and must be approved by the department in writing.\n\n(ii) Submit quarterly progress reports on the action plan to the department.\n\n(2) The department shall review and evaluate the award recipient's progress to determine if the system has improved. If the system has improved, the award recipient will remain eligible for full formula funding as determined under subsection (c). If the system has not improved by the end of the waiver period, the waiver will be withdrawn. Expenses incurred by the award recipient as a result of the failure of the award recipient's system to meet the minimum performance criteria shall be borne by the award recipient.\n\n(h) Adjustments to minimum performance criteria.--Upon written request of an award recipient, the department may adjust the minimum performance criteria described in subsection (g) in a given year if the performance of the award recipient's system is adversely affected by circumstances which are beyond the award recipient's control. Examples are labor strikes, infrastructure failures and natural disasters. The request must include the award recipient's reasons for seeking the adjustment.\n\nCross References.Section 1513 is referred to in sections 1506, 1507, 1512, 1514, 1515, 1516, 1517.1 of this title.",
