Such authority established under the former provisions of Article III of the Pennsylvania Urban Mass Transportation Law or the former provisions of Chapter 15 shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) concerning the organization of an authority under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter or modify in any respect any contract or other obligation of such authority entered into prior to the effective date of this chapter.\n\n(2) An authority created or existing under this chapter, including any authority established under the former provisions of Article III of the Pennsylvania Urban Mass Transportation Law or the former provisions of Chapter 15, shall, without the necessity of action or assignment by it or any other person:\n\n(i) continue in the rights and responsibilities of any authority existing under the former provisions of the Pennsylvania Urban Mass Transportation Law or the former provisions of Chapter 15 for all purposes, including, but not limited to, receipt of all grants, gifts, appropriations, subsidies or other payments;\n\n(ii) continue to be the owner of any real or personal property and enjoy and be subject to any and all rights and responsibilities appurtenant thereto of any authority existing under the former provisions of the Pennsylvania Urban Mass Transportation Law or the former provisions of Chapter 15, including, but not limited to, all assets, property, real and personal, tangible and intangible, all easements and all evidences of ownership or other interest in part or in whole, and all records, and other evidences pertaining thereto; and\n\n(iii) continue to be obligated with respect to all debt and other contractual obligations of any authority existing under the former provisions of the Pennsylvania Urban Mass Transportation Law or the former provisions of Chapter 15.\n\n(3) It is hereby declared to be the intent of the General Assembly that an authority created or existing under this chapter, including any authority established under the former provisions of Article II of the Pennsylvania Urban Mass Transportation Law or the former provisions of Chapter 15, and the members, officers, officials and employees of any of them, shall continue to enjoy sovereign and official immunity, as provided in 1 Pa.C.S. § 2310 (relating to sovereign immunity reaffirmed; specific waiver), and shall remain immune from suit except as provided by and subject to the provision of 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8501 (relating to definitions) through 8528 (relating to limitations on damages).\n\nCross References.Section 1711 is referred to in section 1782 of this title.",

No person shall be released from service under this subsection if the person can be transferred:\n\n(1) to another job classification at a lower grade in which job classification the person had previously served, for which that person is qualified and in which the incumbent is junior in seniority; or\n\n(2) to a vacancy in another job classification for which that person is qualified.\n\n(c) Pension system.--There shall be established and maintained by the authority a pension and retirement system to provide for payments when due under such system or as modified from time to time by resolution of the board. For this purpose, both the board and the participating employees shall make such periodic payments to the established system as may be determined by resolution. The board may provide for participation by its employees in the Social Security program or, in lieu of Social Security payments required to be paid by private corporations engaged in similar activity, shall make payments into such established system at least equal in amount to the amount so required to be paid by such private corporations or shall make such other arrangements as will accomplish the same purpose. Provisions shall be made by the board for all officers and employees of the authority appointed under this chapter to become, subject to procedures adopted by resolution of the board, members and beneficiaries of the pensions and retirement system with uniform rights, privileges, obligations and status as to the class in which the officers and employees belong. Members and beneficiaries of any pension or retirement system established by a transportation system acquired by the authority shall continue to have rights, privileges, benefits, obligations and status with respect to the previously established system.

Nothing in this chapter or in any other law of this Commonwealth shall preclude the negotiation and execution of contracts with respect to real estate-related matters in accordance with and subject solely to the provisions of this paragraph. The general manager may recommend in writing that the board make a finding of special opportunity with respect to a real estate-related matter. The board shall consider the general manager's recommendation at a public meeting. The notice given in accordance with the provisions of 65 Pa.C.S. Ch. 7 (relating to open meetings), with respect to such meeting shall state that the board will consider making a finding of special opportunity at such meeting and shall describe the nature of the proposed finding of special opportunity. Any finding of special opportunity shall be approved by the board in accordance with the provisions of section 1715 (relating to meetings, quorum, officers and records). The board shall adopt, by resolution, a process under which the authority shall enter into contracts needed to implement a finding of special opportunity. The process adopted by the board shall provide a method of prequalifying prospective contracting parties, where appropriate; for the reasonable notification of prospective contracting parties of the issuance of requests for proposals and the reasonable opportunity for qualified prospective contracting parties to submit proposals; for review of proposals from qualified prospective contracting parties; for the negotiation of contracts with one or more prospective contracting parties; for award of contracts on the basis of evaluation of the characteristics of the proposals; and for giving such weight to the various characteristics of any proposal as the board shall determine is in the best interest of the authority. The characteristics by which proposals may be evaluated under a finding of special opportunity may include the likely complexity of the transaction; the amount of investment any selected contracting party will be required to make or offers to make in the real estate-related matter; the experience and prior success of the proposed contracting party in other similar dealings with the same type of real estate-related matters or with the authority; the quality, feasibility and potential for economic success of the proposal; any cost or potential return to the authority; the economic reliability and financial viability of the proposed contracting party; the compatibility of the proposal with the authority's basic function as a public transportation provider; the date by which the proposed contracting party agrees to complete the real estate-related matter; and other factors which the board shall specify. The authority shall make available a copy of the process adopted by the board to any person requesting a copy of the process. The general manager may make a written recommendation to the board concerning the award of a contract under a finding of special opportunity. The general manager's recommendation shall include the identity of the prospective contracting party or parties, the purpose of the contract, the substance of the finding of special opportunity, the substance and term of the proposed contract, the identities of any other prospective contracting parties who submitted proposals and the criteria upon which the general manager's recommendation was made and the reasons for selecting the prospective contracting party. Upon the written recommendation of the general manager, the board may award contracts under this paragraph after approving the awarding of the contract by a resolution adopted at a public meeting. The notice given in accordance with 65 Pa.C.S. Ch. 7 with respect to such meeting shall state that the board will consider awarding a contract under a finding of special opportunity at such meeting and shall describe the subject matter of such proposed contract. The authority shall by April 15 of each year submit a report to the department. The report shall detail the actions of the authority in exploring alternate means of raising revenue and reducing expenses. The department shall review the report and issue its findings and recommendations to the Appropriations Committee and the Transportation Committee of the Senate and the Appropriations Committee and the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives no later than 30 days after receipt of such report for review and consideration of future funding by such committees. Where any alternate means have been rejected, the authority shall demonstrate that the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of that alternate means have been considered. As used in this paragraph, \"finding of special opportunity\" shall mean a written determination by the board that exclusion of a real estate-related matter from bidding procedures, as provided in this chapter or any other law, will be in the best interest of the authority and will be compatible with the authority's basic function as a public transportation provider, considering the nature of the real estate-related matter with respect to which the authority proposes to contract. Any finding of special opportunity shall include the basis on which the finding of special opportunity is being made.\n\n(25) To lease property or contract for service, including managerial and operating service, whenever it can more efficiently and effectively serve the public by so doing, rather than conducting its own operations with its own property.\n\n(26) To have the right to use any public road, street, way, highway, bridge or tunnel for the operation of a transportation system within the metropolitan area. In all cases involving the facilities of a railroad, any operations of which extend beyond the metropolitan area, the exercise of this right by the authority shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission under Title 66 (relating to public utilities) only to the extent that the operations extend beyond the metropolitan area.\n\n(27) To act as agent of any government agency or any Federal agency for the public purposes set forth in this chapter.\n\n(28) To make available to any government agency the recommendations of the authority affecting any area in the authority's field of operation or property therein, which it may deem likely to promote the public health, morals, safety and welfare.\n\n(29) To form plans for the improvement of mass transportation and the operation of a transportation system in order to promote the economic development of the metropolitan area in which the transportation authority operates, to make recommendations concerning mass transportation facilities which the authority does not own or operate, to make recommendations concerning throughways and arterial highway connections to the department and to other appropriate governmental bodies and otherwise to cooperate with all such governmental bodies. The authority shall give advance notice to the department of any plans which it may have for the occupation or use of any part of any State highway.\n\n(30) To rehabilitate, reconstruct and extend as possible all portions of any transportation system acquired by the authority and to maintain at all times a fast, reliable and economical transportation system suitable and adapted to the needs of the municipalities served by the authority and for safe, comfortable and convenient service. To that end, the board shall make every effort to utilize high-speed rights-of-way, private or otherwise, to the maximum extent practicable to avoid air pollution by its vehicles, to abandon no physical property which the authority has determined retains continued usefulness to the authority and to extend its rail and highway services into areas which have sufficient need for them to economically or strategically justify such extension.\n\n(31) To adopt, consistent with the policies of this chapter, and from time to time amend a comprehensive transportation plan. A public hearing shall be conducted prior to adoption or amendment. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in two newspapers of general circulation and a publication specifically designed to reach minorities not fewer than 30 days prior to the hearing.\n\n(32) To do all acts and things necessary for the promotion of its business and the general welfare of the authority to carry out the powers granted to it by this chapter or any other statute. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board shall adopt procedures and practices to implement the provisions of this chapter by resolution of the board.\n\n(b) Public highways.--Private rights and property in the beds of existing public highways vacated in order to facilitate the purposes of the authority shall not be deemed destroyed or ousted by reason of the vacation, but shall be acquired or relocated by the authority in the same manner as other property.\n\n(c) Certain powers denied.--The authority shall have no power, at any time or in any manner, to pledge the credit or taxing power of the Commonwealth or any other government agency, nor shall any of the authority's obligations be deemed to be obligations of the Commonwealth or of any other government agency, nor shall the Commonwealth or any government agency be liable for the payment of principal or interest on such obligations.\n\n(d) No power to levy taxes.--The authority shall not have power to levy taxes for any purpose whatsoever.\n\n(July 7, 2011, P.L.257, No.49, eff. 60 days)\n\n2011 Amendment.Act 49 amended subsec.

No interest in the right-of-way of a railroad company the operations of which extend beyond the metropolitan area shall be acquired or occupied under the power of eminent domain under this section or any other section without the consent of the railroad.\n\n(2) Such properties, upon acquisition by or lease to the authority, shall become and be operated as part of the transportation system of the authority, and the authority shall have all powers in connection with such properties and such operations as are conferred by this chapter.\n\n(3) The authority shall also have the power to enter into agreements to operate any lines located or extending beyond the boundaries of the metropolitan area, such agreements to be subject to all other provisions of this chapter. The authority shall have power to lease or purchase any municipally owned local transportation subways or other municipally owned local transportation facilities for operation and maintenance by the authority.\n\n(b) Condemnation procedure.--\n\n(1) Whenever the authority shall condemn all or substantially all of the property of a transportation system, it may elect to commence condemnation proceedings without immediate passage of title by inserting a provision to that effect in the declaration of taking. In that event, the provisions of section 402 of the act of June 22, 1964 (Sp.Sess., P.L.84, No.6), known as the Eminent Domain Code, shall not apply, and the title shall not pass to the authority and the authority shall not be entitled to possession until payment to the condemnee or into court of the amount of the just compensation payable for the property taken, determined as of the date of filing of the declaration of taking, as finally determined in accordance with the provisions of this article, provided that such payment occurs within one year of the final determination.\n\n(2) From and after the filing of the declaration of taking until the payment to the condemnee of just compensation for the condemned property, the authority shall have the right to petition the court having jurisdiction of the proceedings to prevent waste, substantial disposition or any transaction with respect to the condemned property other than in the ordinary course of business without obtaining the prior written consent of the authority. The condemnee shall have no right to tender possession of the property or otherwise to demand payment of any compensation prior to the passage of title.\n\nReferences in Text.The act of June 22, 1964 (Sp. Sess., P.L.84, No.6), known as the Eminent Domain Code, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), was repealed by the act of May 4, 2006 (P.L.112, No.34).
