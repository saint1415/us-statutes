Each joint airport zoning board shall have as members two representatives appointed by each municipality participating in its creation and, in addition, a chairman elected by a majority of the members so appointed.\n\n(c) Definition.--As used in this section the word \"airport\" does not include facilities designated as heliports and which can be used only by rotary wing aircraft, nor airports which are private airports.\n\nCross References.Section 5912 is referred to in section 5102 of this title.",
