(2) Except as provided under paragraph (3), the property under paragraph (1) shall include funds and indebtedness. (3) If adjusting property and indebtedness under paragraph (1), streets, sewers and utilities may not be considered except to the extent that current and unpaid indebtedness was incurred for the construction and improvement of the property. (b) Proportion.-- In making the adjustment and apportionment under subsection (a), the following shall apply: (1) The municipality gaining territory shall be entitled to a division of the property and indebtedness in the same proportion that the assessed valuation of the taxable real estate included within the territorial limits of the newly gained territory bears to the assessed valuation of the taxable real estate in the municipality losing territory immediately prior to the boundary change. The municipality losing territory shall be entitled to the remainder of the property and indebtedness. (2) If indebtedness was incurred by the municipality losing territory for an improvement located wholly within the territorial limits of the newly transferred territory, the indebtedness shall be assumed by the municipality gaining territory. (3) If only part of the improvement is located within the newly transferred territory, the part of the indebtedness representing the part of the improvement located within transferred territory shall be assumed by the municipality gaining territory and the adjustment and apportionment of any remaining debt shall be retained by the municipality losing territory.

(e) Appointment.-- After receiving a petition under subsection (d), the court shall appoint three disinterested commissioners.

(a) Applicability.-- Design professional services shall be procured as provided in this section except as authorized by sections 514 (relating to small procurements), 515 (relating to sole source procurement) and 516 (relating to emergency procurement). (b) Policy.-- It is the policy of this Commonwealth to publicly announce all requirements for design professional services and to award contracts for design professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the types of services required. There shall be a committee to review the qualifications, experience and work of design professionals seeking contracts with purchasing agencies. (c) Selection committees for Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities.-- Where they are authorized by law to act as purchasing agency for design professional services, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities shall each establish as many selection committees as the department deems appropriate and a procedure for the selection of committee members. (d) Selection committee for all other Commonwealth agencies.-- Except as provided for in subsection (c), all purchasing agencies shall use the selection committee appointed by the Governor which shall be composed of five members, none of whom shall be employees of the Commonwealth or hold any elective office or office in any political party. The members shall be architects, engineers or other persons knowledgeable in construction. The members shall serve for terms of two years and shall not be removed except for cause. Of the original members, three shall serve for terms of two years and two for terms of one year. Thereafter, all terms shall be for two years. Each member shall be reimbursed for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred incident to attendance at meetings and to assigned duties and also a per diem allowance in accordance with Commonwealth travel policies. (e) Procedure for selection committees.-- The selection committees shall use the procedure set forth in this subsection: (1) The committee shall give public notice of projects requiring design services and publicly recommend to the purchasing agency three qualified design professionals for each project. (2) If desired, the committee may conduct discussions with three or more professionals regarding anticipated design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment. The committee shall select, based upon criteria established by the head of the purchasing agency, no less than three design professionals deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. In exercising its responsibility, the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) An equitable distribution of contracts to design professionals. (ii) Particular capability to perform the design or construction services for the contract being considered. (iii) Geographic proximity of the design professional to the proposed facility. (iv) The design professional selected has the necessary available personnel to perform the services required by the project. (v) Any other relevant circumstances peculiar to the proposed contract. (f) Design professionals.-- Except as provided for in subsection (g), the head of the purchasing agency shall select design professionals as follows: (1) Where the amount of the base construction allocation is less than $20,000,000, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The fee to be paid to the appointed design professional may be established by the selection committee or may be negotiated at the discretion of the head of the purchasing agency. The $20,000,000 threshold shall be adjusted by the department to reflect the annual percentage change in the Composite Construction Cost Index of the United States Department of Commerce occurring in the one-year period ending December 31 each year. (2) Where the amount of base construction allocation is in excess of or equal to $20,000,000, as annually adjusted, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee to begin contract negotiations. The fee to be paid to the design professional and the terms of the contract between the design professional and the department shall be negotiated by the head of the purchasing agency. In negotiating the contract and the fee, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, uniqueness and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the appointed design professional, negotiations with that design professional shall be terminated, and the head of the purchasing agency shall commence negotiations with one of the other firms chosen by the selection committee. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the second firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall terminate negotiations with the second design professional and commence negotiation with the third firm. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall choose additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this subsection until an agreement is reached. (g) Selection method for Department of Transportation, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Protection and State-affiliated entities.-- In the event the Department of Transportation, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection or a State-affiliated entity otherwise authorized by law to use its own selection committee requires the services of a design professional, the head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall negotiate with the firm determined to be the highest qualified firm for design professional services at a fee which is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth. In making this decision, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee he determines to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The head of the purchasing agency shall then undertake negotiations with the firm he determines to be the second highest qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the third highest qualified firm. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the committee shall select additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

A county which has adopted a home rule charter shall not at any time thereafter exercise within any municipality in the county a power or function being exercised by that municipality, except under all of the following conditions: (1) The exercise of such power or function by the county shall be authorized by ordinance of the governing body of the county, which ordinance, in addition to such other filings as may be required by law, shall be filed with the clerk or secretary of each local municipality within the county within 30 days of its enactment. (2) The transfer of a power or function to the county from any local municipality within the county, as authorized by the ordinance, shall not become effective for at least 15 months from the date of adoption of the ordinance. (3) Within 120 days from the adoption of the ordinance, the governing body of any local municipality, exercising on the date of the adoption of the ordinance any power or function authorized by ordinance of the county to be exercised by the county, may elect by ordinance to be excluded from the county's exercise of the power or function. Within 60 days after the date of adoption by the governing body of a local municipality of an ordinance excluding the local municipality from the exercise by the county of a power or function or in the absence of any action of the governing body, the qualified electors of the local municipality may initiate a petition requiring that the question of inclusion or exclusion from the exercise of the power or function by the county be submitted to a referendum of the electorate at the election held on the date of the next ensuing primary, municipal or general election not less than 60 days after the filing of the initiative petition with the county board of elections. The initiative and referendum procedures set forth in this subchapter or Subchapter F (relating to general provisions and limitations for optional plan municipalities) shall be followed, except where the same may be inconsistent with any of the provisions of this section. In the event the county determines there is insufficient interest or that it is not feasible to establish the proposed municipal function or power as provided for in the ordinance passed by the county, the county may repeal the county ordinance prior to the effective date of the ordinance. (4) The governing body of any local municipality may by ordinance, subsequent to the time limit for action as set forth in paragraph (3), request the county to be included in a municipal power or function being exercised by the county. However, the county may specify the terms and conditions for acceptance or denial of the power or function requested by the local municipality to be exercised by the county, which shall be subject to court review if the local municipality determines that the terms and conditions as set forth by the county are unreasonable. (5) No assessment, tax, fee or levy in the nature thereof made by the governing body of a county in support of the exercise of a power or function as authorized by ordinance of the county shall be applicable in any local municipality within the county which is providing the same municipal power or function. (6) If the electors of a local municipality by referendum vote to exclude the local municipality from the exercise of a power or function by the county, a petition may not be initiated nor may a referendum be held on the same question more often than every five years thereafter. (7) A local municipality may, by action of the governing body or by initiative and referendum, withdraw from a power or function which it was exercising at the date of the adoption of the county home rule charter which it transferred to a county, provided it again assumes and exercises the power or function, but may not vote on the question of withdrawing sooner than four years from the time the county assumed the power or function of the local municipality.",
