      "text": "(a) Short title.--This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the Motor Vehicle Procurement Act.\n\n(b) Legislative findings.--It is hereby determined by the General Assembly to reaffirm the legislative findings contained in the act of April 4, 1984 (P.L.193, No.40), known as the Motor Vehicle Procurement Act, and codified in this chapter:\n\n(1) The production of motor vehicles and component parts constitutes a major industry of this Commonwealth. It provides employment for and incomes of hundreds of thousands of the people of this Commonwealth and, in turn, millions of persons in the United States.\n\n(2) The taxes paid to the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions by employers and employees engaged in the production and sale of motor vehicles is one of the largest single sources of public revenues in this Commonwealth.\n\n(3) It has for many years been the policy of this Commonwealth to aid and support the development and expansion of industry here to foster the economic well-being of this Commonwealth and its people.\n\n(4) The economy and general welfare of this Commonwealth and its citizens as well as the economy, general welfare and national security of the United States are inseparably related in the preservation and development of the motor vehicle industry in this Commonwealth and in other states of the United States.\n\n(5) The production of motor vehicles and motor vehicle components in Canada involves the use of a substantial amount of resources from the United States, including labor and materials. The General Assembly declares it to be the policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that public officers and agencies should aid and promote the development of the motor vehicle industry of North America to stimulate and improve the economic well-being of this Commonwealth and its citizens.\n\n(c) Purpose of subchapter.--This subchapter is intended as remedial legislation designed to promote the general welfare and stimulate the economy of this Commonwealth and its people. Each provision shall receive a liberal construction to effectuate that intention. None of the provisions of this subchapter shall receive a strict or limited construction.\n\nReferences in Text.The act of April 4, 1982 (P.L.193, No.403), known as the Motor Vehicle Procurement Act, referred to in subsec. (b), was repealed by the act of May 15, 1998 (P.L.358, No.57). The subject matter is now contained in Subchapter B of Chapter 17 of this title.",
