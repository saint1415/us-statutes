The request for relief and the supporting evidence must be received by the local government unit within a reasonable time period after the bid opening. The time period shall be specified by the local government unit.

      "text": "§ 107. Reciprocal limitations. (a) Short title of section.-- This section shall be known and may be cited as the Reciprocal Limitations Act. (b) Legislative findings.-- It is hereby determined by the General Assembly to reaffirm the legislative findings contained in the act of November 28, 1986 (P.L.1465, No.146), known as the Reciprocal Limitations Act, and codified in this section: (1) The award of contracts to the lowest responsible bidder generally provides for the most economical procurement of supplies and construction. (2) In some cases, award to the lowest responsible bidder may not be the most economical and practicable when the best interests of the Commonwealth are concerned. (3) Some states apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or they apply a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders. (4) The application of this preference or prohibition by other states diminishes or eliminates opportunities for bidders and manufacturers who reside in this Commonwealth to obtain construction contracts from or to sell supplies to states that have this preference, thereby resulting in the loss of business for resident bidders and manufacturers. Therefore, in order to offset or counteract the discriminatory practices of other states, discourage other states from applying a preference and ultimately to aid employment, help business and industry located in this Commonwealth, attract new business and industry to this Commonwealth and provide additional tax revenue both from those receiving contracts and those employed by contractors, the General Assembly hereby declares that it is the policy of this Commonwealth to respond in like manner against those states that apply preferences or prohibitions by giving a similar offsetting preference to residents in this Commonwealth and bidders offering supplies manufactured in this Commonwealth and by prohibiting the purchase or use of certain supplies, in accordance with the provisions of this section. (c) Preference for supplies.-- In all procurements of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 (relating to small procurements), all Commonwealth agencies shall give preference to those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in this Commonwealth as against those bidders or offerors offering supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that gives or requires a preference to supplies produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the other state for that particular supply. (d) Preference for resident bidders or offerors.-- When a contract for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 is to be awarded, a resident bidder or offeror shall be granted a preference as against a nonresident bidder or offeror from any state that gives or requires a preference to bidders or offerors from that state. The amount of the preference shall be equal to the amount of the preference applied by the state of the nonresident bidder or offeror. (e) Prohibition.-- For all contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, no Commonwealth agency shall specify for, use or procure any supplies which are produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in any state that prohibits the specification for, use or procurement of these supplies in or on its public buildings or other works when these supplies are not produced, manufactured, mined, grown or performed in that state. (f) Listing discriminating states.-- The department shall prepare a list of the states which apply a preference favoring in-state supplies or bidders or offerors or a prohibition against the use of out-of-state supplies or bidders or offerors and shall publish the list in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. When a state applies a new preference or prohibition, the department shall publish that information in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as an addition to the original list. (g) Inclusion in invitation for bids or request for proposals.-- In all invitations for bids and requests for proposals for the procurement of supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514, all Commonwealth agencies shall include a list of all the states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference favoring in-state supplies, bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the department for small procurements under section 514 shall include a list of all states that have been found by the department to have applied a preference for in-state bidders or offerors and the amount of the preference. All invitations for bids, requests for proposals and notices issued for the purpose of securing bids or proposals for contracts for construction or supplies exceeding the amount established by the purchasing agency for small procurements under section 514 shall also include a list of all states that apply a prohibition against certain supplies and shall inform potential bidders or offerors that they are prohibited from using supplies from those states. If a bid or proposal discloses that the bidder or offeror is offering supplies from a state which prohibits the use of out-of-state supplies, the bid or proposal shall be rejected. (h) Federal funds.-- The provisions of this section shall not be applicable when the application of this section may jeopardize the receipt of Federal funds. (i) Waiver.-- The provisions of this section may be waived when the head of the purchasing agency determines in writing that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth. (j) Definitions.-- As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection: \"Resident bidder or offeror.\" A person, partnership, corporation or other business entity authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth and having a bona fide establishment for transacting business in this Commonwealth at which it was transacting business on the date when bids or proposals for the public contract were first solicited.

The following procedure shall apply to construction to be completed by the department which costs more than the amount established by the department under section 514 (relating to small procurements) for construction procurement unless the work is to be done by Commonwealth agency employees or by inmates or patients of a Commonwealth agency institution: (1) The Commonwealth agency or State-related institution shall notify the department to have plans and specifications for the project. (2) Promptly after the notice in such cases or promptly after any appropriation made to it becomes available, the department shall, if necessary, select an architect and/or an engineer in accordance with the selection procedures of section 905 (relating to procurement of design professional services) to design the work and prepare the specifications therefor. The department may, as an alternative, enter into a design/build contract in accordance with section 511 (relating to methods of source selection). Such design/build contracts shall be subject to the requirements of this act and the provisions of the act of August 15, 1961 (P.L.987, No.442), known as the Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Act. Design/build contracts shall also be subject to the act of May 1, 1913 (P.L.155, No.104), entitled \"An act regulating the letting of certain contracts for the erection, construction, and alteration of public buildings,\" to the extent provided in paragraph (6). (3) The department shall enter into a contract with the architect or engineer which shall provide all of the following: (i) A date for the completion of the plans and specifications. (ii) That the plans and specifications must meet with the approval of the Commonwealth agency or State-related institution for which the building is being erected, altered or enlarged and, in the case of an administrative board or commission of the Commonwealth agency with which the board or commission is respectively connected, to the extent of the type and general character of the building, design of the floor layouts, medical equipment or other equipment of a nature peculiar to the building for which the plans and specifications are being prepared. (iii) That the plans, drawings and specifications must be approved by the department. (iv) That the plans and specifications must be approved by the Department of Labor and Industry, the Department of Health and the Department of Environmental Protection to the extent to which those Commonwealth agencies, respectively, have jurisdiction to require the submission to them for approval of certain features of the building. The architect or engineer in preparing plans and specifications shall consult with the department, and the department shall insist upon the prompt completion of the plans and specifications within the time prescribed in the architect's or engineer's contracts unless it shall specifically agree in writing to an extension thereof. (4) The enforcement of all contracts provided for by this section shall be under the control and supervision of the department. The department shall have the authority to engage the services of a construction management firm to coordinate the work of the total project. All questions or disputes arising between the department and any contractor with respect to any matter pertaining to a contract entered into with the department or any part thereto or any breach of contract arising thereunder shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration as provided by the terms of the contract, which finding shall be final and not subject to further appeal, or, if not so provided, shall be referred to the Board of Claims as set forth in the act of May 20, 1937 (P.L.728, No.193), referred to as the Board of Claims Act, whose decision and award shall be final and binding and conclusive upon all parties thereto except that either party shall have the right to appeal from the decision and award as provided by law. (5) The department shall examine all bills on account of the contracts entered into under the provisions of this section, and, if they are correct, the department shall certify that the materials have been furnished or that the work or labor has been performed in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with the contract, approve the bills and issue its requisition therefor or forward its certificate to the proper Commonwealth agency or State-related institution as the case may be. Progress payments and final payments shall not estop the department from pursuing its lawful remedies for defects in workmanship or materials or both and other damages. (6) For construction contracts where the total construction costs are less than $25,000, the department shall not be required to comply with the act of May 1, 1913 (P.L.155, No.104), entitled \"An act regulating the letting of certain contracts for the erection, construction, and alteration of public buildings,\" and the department may award such contracts in accordance with section 511. All projects equal to or exceeding $25,000 shall be subject to the act of May 1, 1913 (P.L.155, No.104), entitled \"An act regulating the letting of certain contracts for the erection, construction, and alteration of public buildings.\" Whenever the department enters into a single contract for a project, in the absence of good and sufficient reasons the contractor shall pay each subcontractor, within 15 days of receipt of payment from the department, an amount equal to the percentage of completion allowed to the contractor on the account of the subcontractor's work. The contractor shall also require the subcontractor to make similar payments to his subcontractors. (7) The department shall have the right to engage the services of any architect or consulting or supervising engineer or engineers whom it may deem necessary for the proper designing of or inspection or supervision of projects constructed, altered or enlarged by the department under this section in accordance with the selection procedures of section 905. (8) Changes in scope in the plans or specifications, or both, may be made after their approval only with the consent of the Governor and all of the Commonwealth agencies and State-related institutions whose approval of the original plans or specifications, or both, was necessary under this section. (9) If the appropriation is to a Commonwealth agency, other than the department or State-related institution, the department shall award and enter into the contract as agent for the Commonwealth agency or State-related institution to which the appropriation was made.

(a) General rule.-- The commission may, on its own motion and whenever it may be necessary in the performance of its duties, investigate and examine the condition and management of any public utility or any other person or corporation subject to this part. In conducting the investigations the commission may proceed, either with or without a hearing, as it may deem best, but it shall make no order without affording the parties affected thereby a hearing. Any investigation, inquiry or hearing which the commission has power to undertake or hold shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. (b) Assignment of proceedings; powers of chairman.-- All on-the-record proceedings shall be referred to an administrative law judge for decision except that in those proceedings involving a rate determination, safety matters, rulemaking procedures, unprotested applications or matters covered by section 335(a)(1) (relating to initial decisions), the commission may authorize the chairman to assign cases as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3); and, in addition, the commission may authorize the chairman to: (1) Designate the time and place for the conducting of investigations, inquiries and hearings. (2) Assign cases to a commissioner or commissioners for hearing, investigation, inquiry, study or other similar purposes. (3) Assign cases to special agents or administrative law judges for the taking and receiving of evidence. (4) Direct and designate officers and employees of the commission to make investigations, inspections, inquiries, studies and other like assignments for reports to the commission. (5) Be responsible through the secretary for specifically enumerated daily administrative operations of the commission. (c) Requirements for presiding officers.-- There shall preside at the taking of evidence the commission, one or more commissioners, or one or more administrative law judges appointed as provided in this chapter. The functions of all presiding officers shall be conducted in an impartial manner. Any such officer may at any time withdraw from a proceeding if he deems himself disqualified, and, upon the filing in good faith of a timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of any such officer, the commission shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the proceeding. (d) Authority of presiding officers.-- In addition to any administrative rules of procedure contained in this part, the commission may adopt and publish such additional rules of procedure as are not inconsistent with this part. Officers presiding at hearings shall have authority subject to the published rules of the commission and within its powers, to: (1) Administer oaths and affirmations. (2) Issue subpoenas authorized by law. (3) Rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence, take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of justice would be served thereby. (4) Regulate the course of the hearing. (5) Require persons requesting to make a statement at a public input hearing to state their name, occupation and place of employment for the record. (6) Hold conferences for settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties. (7) Dispose of procedural requests or similar matters. (8) Make decisions or recommend decisions in conformity within this part. (9) Take any other action authorized by commission rule. (e) Interlocutory appeals.-- A presiding officer may certify to the commission, or allow the parties an interlocutory appeal to the commission on any material question arising in the course of a proceeding, where he finds that it is necessary to do so to prevent substantial prejudice to any party or to expedite the conduct of the proceeding. The presiding officer or the commission may thereafter stay the proceeding if necessary to protect the substantial rights of any of the parties therein. The commission shall determine the question forthwith and the hearing and further decision shall thereafter be governed accordingly. No interlocutory appeal to the commission shall otherwise be allowed, except as may be allowed by the commission. (f) Declaratory orders.-- The commission, with like effect as in the case of other orders, and in its sound discretion, may issue a declaratory order to terminate a controversy or remove uncertainty. (g) Official notice defined.-- As used in this chapter the term \"official notice\" means a method by which the commission may notify all parties that no further evidence will be heard on a material fact and that unless the parties prove to the contrary, the commission's findings will include that particular fact.

(a) Burden of proof.-- Except as may be otherwise provided in section 315 (relating to burden of proof) or other provisions of this part or other relevant statute, the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof. (b) Admissibility of evidence.-- Any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the commission shall as a matter of policy provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. No sanction shall be imposed or rule or order be issued except upon consideration of the whole record or such portions thereof as may be cited by any party and as supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative and substantial evidence. (c) Submission of evidence.-- Every party is entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The commission may, by rule, adopt procedures for the submission of all or part of the evidence in written form. (d) Record, briefs and argument.-- The transcript of a public input hearing, the transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, constitutes the exclusive record for decision, and shall be available for inspection by the public. Briefing and oral argument shall be held in accordance with rules established by the commission. For the purpose of this section, a public input hearing is a hearing held in the service area at which the ratepayers may offer testimony, written or otherwise, relating to any matter which has a bearing on the proceeding. (e) Official notice of facts.-- When the commission's decision rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, upon notification that facts are about to be or have been noticed, any party adversely affected shall have the opportunity upon timely request to show that the facts are not properly noticed or that alternative facts should be noticed. The commission in its discretion shall determine whether written presentations suffice, or whether oral argument, oral evidence, or cross-examination is appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the application by the commission in appropriate circumstances of the doctrine of judicial notice. (f) Actions of parties and counsel.-- Any party who shall fail to be represented at a scheduled conference or hearing after being duly notified thereof, shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to participate in such conference or hearing, and shall not be permitted thereafter to reopen the disposition of any matter accomplished thereat, or to recall for further examination of witnesses who were excused, unless the presiding officer shall determine that failure to be represented was unavoidable and that the interests of the other parties and the public would not be prejudiced by permitting such reopening or further examination. If the actions of a party or counsel in a proceeding shall be determined by the commission, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, to be obstructive to the orderly conduct of the proceeding and inimical to the public interest, the commission may reject or dismiss any rule or order in any manner proposed by the offending party or counsel, and, with respect to counsel, may bar further participation by him in any proceedings before the commission. (g) Decision of administrative law judge.-- In all on-the-record proceedings referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) (relating to powers of commission and administrative law judges), hearings shall be commenced by the administrative law judge within 90 days after the proceeding is initiated, and he shall render a decision within 90 days after the record is closed, unless the commission for good cause by order allows an extension not to exceed an additional 90 days. (h) Exceptions and appeal procedure.-- Any party to a proceeding referred to an administrative law judge under section 331(b) may file exceptions to the decision of the administrative law judge with the commission, in a form and manner and within the time to be prescribed by the commission. The commission shall rule upon such exceptions within 90 days after filing. If no exceptions are filed, the decision shall become final, without further commission action, unless two or more commissioners within 15 days after the decision request that the commission review the decision and make such other order, within 90 days of such request, as it shall determine. The Office of Trial Staff and the chief counsel shall be deemed to have automatic standing as a party to such proceeding and may file exceptions to any decision of the administrative law judge under this subsection. (i) Review of testimony.-- Any party of record in an investigation or inquiry by or hearing before the commission or its representative whose testimony is recorded electronically and subsequently transcribed shall, upon request, be permitted to review the recording to ensure that it has been transcribed accurately. The commission may impose a fee in an amount not exceeding the actual costs involved for making the recording available. Any request to review the recording must be made within the time prescribed by commission regulation, and such request shall not be used to unreasonably delay commission proceedings. This section shall not be construed to require the electronic recording of testimony. The official record of a proceeding shall be the written transcript.

(a) Upgrading capability to use coal.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations which require utilities to uprate their electric power production by increasing the capability to use coal in existing coal-fueled plants where economically feasible and where the uprate is beneficial to ratepayers. (b) Incentive for uprating.-- The commission shall promulgate regulations which establish a special cost recovery and shared benefits procedure for electric utilities and their ratepayers as an incentive to implement upratings as provided in subsection (a). Nothing in this section shall permit or require the commission to establish rates or procedures which are inconsistent with any other section in this title. (c) Cost of upgrading.-- Notwithstanding section 1315 (relating to limitation on consideration of certain costs for electric utilities) and subject to regulations promulgated by the commission, the commission may allow a portion of the prudently incurred costs, determined on a per megawatt basis and not to exceed 50% of the unit's undepreciated original cost per megawatt, of uprating the capability of an existing coal-fueled plant to use coal mined in Pennsylvania to be made a part of the rate base or otherwise included in the rates charged by the utility before such uprating is completed. This subsection shall not apply unless, upon application of the affected public utility, the commission determines that the uprating would be more cost effective for the utility's ratepayers than other alternatives for meeting the utility's load and capacity requirements. Notwithstanding section 1309 (relating to rates fixed on complaint; investigation of costs of production), the commission, by regulation, shall provide for a utility to remove the costs of an uprating from its rate base and to refund any revenues collected as the result of this subsection, plus interest, which shall be the average rate of interest specified for residential mortgage lending by the Secretary of Banking in accordance with the act of January 30, 1974 (P.L.13, No.6), referred to as the Loan Interest and Protection Law, during the period or periods for which the commission orders refunds, if the commission, after notice and hearings, determines that the uprating has not been completed within a reasonable time.

(a) Submission of estimate.-- No later than 30 days after construction of an electric generating unit is begun, either in this Commonwealth or in some other state, any public utility operating in this Commonwealth and owning any share in that unit shall submit to the commission an estimate of the cost of constructing that unit. If the public utility acquires ownership of any share in an electric generating unit which is under construction on the date of acquisition, the public utility shall, within 30 days of the date of acquisition, submit an estimate of the cost of constructing that unit which was formulated no later than 30 days from the beginning of construction. (b) Auditor in charge.-- For each electric generating unit under construction which falls under the provisions of this section, the commission shall designate an auditor in charge. In addition to the access to evidence granted by this section, each utility having a generating unit under construction shall promptly submit, to the appropriate auditor in charge, copies and a description of any change with respect to construction which may be expected to result in substantial variances in the construction cost. A summary of all other changes shall be submitted to the commission at such reasonable times as the commission shall require. (c) Access to evidence.-- From and after the beginning of construction of an electric generating unit, the commission, or the auditor in charge, and the Consumer Advocate, or his designee, shall have reasonable access to the construction site and to any oral or documentary evidence relevant to determining the necessity and propriety of any construction cost. If a public utility objects to any request by the commission or the auditor in charge or the Consumer Advocate, or the person designated by the Consumer Advocate, for access to the construction site or to any oral or documentary evidence, the objection shall be decided in the same manner as an on-the-record proceeding pursuant to Chapter 3 (relating to public utility commission). The affected public utility shall have the burden of proof in sustaining any such objection. (d) Definition.-- As used in this section the term \"construction\" includes any work performed on an electric generating unit which is expected to require the affected public utility to incur an aggregate of at least $100,000,000 of expenses which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are capital expenses and not operating or maintenance expenses.

The commission shall establish procedures for audits of the operations of utilities as provided in this section.

A summary of the audits mandated by this subsection shall be released to the public, and a complete copy of the audits shall be provided to the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate. (b) Management efficiency investigations.-- In addition to the audits mandated by subsection (a), the commission shall appoint a management efficiency investigator who shall periodically examine the management effectiveness and operating efficiency of all utilities required to be audited under subsection (a) and monitor the utility company responses to the audits required by subsection (a). For the purposes of carrying out the periodic audit required by this subsection and for carrying out the monitoring of audits required by subsection (a), the commission is hereby empowered to direct the management efficiency investigator to conduct such investigations through and with teams made up of commission staff and/or independent consulting firms; further, the commission may designate specific items of management effectiveness and operating efficiency to be investigated. The management efficiency investigator shall provide an annual report to the commission, the affected utility, the Office of Trial Staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate detailing the findings of such investigations. (c) Use of independent auditing firms.-- The commission may require an audit under subsection (a) or (b) to be performed by an independent consulting firm. When the commission, under either subsection (a) or (b), orders an audit to be performed by an independent consulting firm, the commission, after consultation with the utility, shall select the firm and require the utility to enter into a contract with the firm providing for payment of the firm by the utility. The terms of the contract shall include all reasonable expenses directly related to the performance of the audit or to the management efficiency investigation activities of independent consulting firms at the utility, as well as their preparation and presentation of testimony in any contested litigation which may be undertaken as a result of the audit findings under subsection (a) or (b).

(a) Applicability.-- Design professional services shall be procured as provided in this section except as authorized by sections 514 (relating to small procurements), 515 (relating to sole source procurement) and 516 (relating to emergency procurement). (b) Policy.-- It is the policy of this Commonwealth to publicly announce all requirements for design professional services and to award contracts for design professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the types of services required. There shall be a committee to review the qualifications, experience and work of design professionals seeking contracts with purchasing agencies. (c) Selection committees for Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities.-- Where they are authorized by law to act as purchasing agency for design professional services, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and State-affiliated entities shall each establish as many selection committees as the department deems appropriate and a procedure for the selection of committee members. (d) Selection committee for all other Commonwealth agencies.-- Except as provided for in subsection (c), all purchasing agencies shall use the selection committee appointed by the Governor which shall be composed of five members, none of whom shall be employees of the Commonwealth or hold any elective office or office in any political party. The members shall be architects, engineers or other persons knowledgeable in construction. The members shall serve for terms of two years and shall not be removed except for cause. Of the original members, three shall serve for terms of two years and two for terms of one year. Thereafter, all terms shall be for two years. Each member shall be reimbursed for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred incident to attendance at meetings and to assigned duties and also a per diem allowance in accordance with Commonwealth travel policies. (e) Procedure for selection committees.-- The selection committees shall use the procedure set forth in this subsection: (1) The committee shall give public notice of projects requiring design services and publicly recommend to the purchasing agency three qualified design professionals for each project. (2) If desired, the committee may conduct discussions with three or more professionals regarding anticipated design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment. The committee shall select, based upon criteria established by the head of the purchasing agency, no less than three design professionals deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. In exercising its responsibility, the committee shall consider the following factors: (i) An equitable distribution of contracts to design professionals. (ii) Particular capability to perform the design or construction services for the contract being considered. (iii) Geographic proximity of the design professional to the proposed facility. (iv) The design professional selected has the necessary available personnel to perform the services required by the project. (v) Any other relevant circumstances peculiar to the proposed contract. (f) Design professionals.-- Except as provided for in subsection (g), the head of the purchasing agency shall select design professionals as follows: (1) Where the amount of the base construction allocation is less than $20,000,000, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The fee to be paid to the appointed design professional may be established by the selection committee or may be negotiated at the discretion of the head of the purchasing agency. The $20,000,000 threshold shall be adjusted by the department to reflect the annual percentage change in the Composite Construction Cost Index of the United States Department of Commerce occurring in the one-year period ending December 31 each year. (2) Where the amount of base construction allocation is in excess of or equal to $20,000,000, as annually adjusted, the head of the purchasing agency shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee to begin contract negotiations. The fee to be paid to the design professional and the terms of the contract between the design professional and the department shall be negotiated by the head of the purchasing agency. In negotiating the contract and the fee, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity, uniqueness and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the appointed design professional, negotiations with that design professional shall be terminated, and the head of the purchasing agency shall commence negotiations with one of the other firms chosen by the selection committee. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or fee with the second firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall terminate negotiations with the second design professional and commence negotiation with the third firm. In the event the head of the purchasing agency is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the selection committee shall choose additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this subsection until an agreement is reached. (g) Selection method for Department of Transportation, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Protection and State-affiliated entities.-- In the event the Department of Transportation, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection or a State-affiliated entity otherwise authorized by law to use its own selection committee requires the services of a design professional, the head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall choose one of the three firms approved by the selection committee. The head of the purchasing agency or a State-affiliated entity shall negotiate with the firm determined to be the highest qualified firm for design professional services at a fee which is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth. In making this decision, the head of the purchasing agency shall take into account the estimated value, scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee he determines to be fair and reasonable to the Commonwealth, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The head of the purchasing agency shall then undertake negotiations with the firm he determines to be the second highest qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the head of the purchasing agency shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the third highest qualified firm. Should the head of the purchasing agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the committee shall select additional qualified firms, and the head of the purchasing agency shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

(a) Right to protest.-- A bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror or a prospective contractor that is aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract, except as provided in section 521 (relating to cancellation of invitations for bids or requests for proposals), may protest to the head of the purchasing agency in writing. (b) Filing of protest.-- If the protestant is a bidder or offeror or a prospective contractor, the protest shall be filed with the head of the purchasing agency within seven days after the aggrieved bidder or offeror or prospective contractor knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the protest except that in no event may a protest be filed later than seven days after the date the contract was awarded. If the protestant is a prospective bidder or offeror, a protest shall be filed with the head of the purchasing agency prior to the bid opening time or the proposal receipt date. If a bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror or a prospective contractor fails to file a protest or files an untimely protest, the bidder or offeror, the prospective bidder or offeror or the prospective contractor shall be deemed to have waived its right to protest the solicitation or award of the contract in any forum. Untimely filed protests shall be disregarded by the purchasing agency. (c) Contents of protest.-- A protest shall state all grounds upon which the protestant asserts the solicitation or award of the contract was improper. The protestant may submit with the protest any documents or information it deems relevant to the protest. (d) Response and reply.-- Within 15 days of receipt of a protest, the contracting officer may submit to the head of the purchasing agency and the protestant a response to the protest, including any documents or information he deems relevant to the protest. The protestant may file a reply to the response within ten days of the date of the response. (e) Evaluation of protest.-- The head of the purchasing agency or his designee shall review the protest and any response or reply and may request and review such additional documents or information he deems necessary to render a decision and may, at his sole discretion, conduct a hearing. The head of the purchasing agency or his designee shall provide to the protestant and the contracting officer a reasonable opportunity to review and address any additional documents or information deemed necessary by the head of the purchasing agency or his designee to render a decision. (f) Determination.-- Upon completing an evaluation of the protest in accordance with subsection (e), the head of the purchasing agency or his designee shall issue a written determination stating the reasons for the decision. The determination shall be issued within 60 days of the receipt of the protest unless extended by consent of the head of the purchasing agency or his designee and the protestant. The determination shall be the final order of the purchasing agency. If the head of the purchasing agency or his designee determines that the solicitation or award of the contract was contrary to law, he may enter an order authorized by section 1711.2 (relating to solicitations or awards contrary to law). (g) Appeal.-- Within 15 days of the mailing date of a final determination denying a protest, a protestant may file an appeal with Commonwealth Court. Issues not raised by the protestant before the purchasing agency are deemed waived and may not be raised before the court.

(i) Standard of review.-- The court shall hear the appeal, without a jury, on the record of determination certified by the purchasing agency. The court shall affirm the determination of the purchasing agency unless it finds from the record that the determination is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion or is contrary to law.

(k) Stay of procurement during pendency of protest.-- In the event a protest is filed timely under this section and until the time has elapsed for the protestant to file an appeal with Commonwealth Court, the purchasing agency shall not proceed further with the solicitation or with the award of the contract unless and until the head of the purchasing agency, after consultation with the head of the using agency, makes a written determination that the protest is clearly without merit or that award of the contract without delay is necessary to protect substantial interests of the Commonwealth. (l) Applicability.-- This section shall be the exclusive procedure for protesting a solicitation or award of a contract by a bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror or a prospective contractor that is aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract. The provisions of 2 Pa.C.S. (relating to administrative law and procedure) shall not apply to this section. (Dec. 3, 2002, P.L.1147, No.142, eff. imd.) 2002 Amendment. Act 142 added section 1711.1.

(b) Legislative findings.-- It is hereby determined by the General Assembly to reaffirm the legislative findings contained in the act of April 4, 1984 (P.L.193, No.40), known as the Motor Vehicle Procurement Act, and codified in this chapter: (1) The production of motor vehicles and component parts constitutes a major industry of this Commonwealth. It provides employment for and incomes of hundreds of thousands of the people of this Commonwealth and, in turn, millions of persons in the United States. (2) The taxes paid to the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions by employers and employees engaged in the production and sale of motor vehicles is one of the largest single sources of public revenues in this Commonwealth. (3) It has for many years been the policy of this Commonwealth to aid and support the development and expansion of industry here to foster the economic well-being of this Commonwealth and its people. (4) The economy and general welfare of this Commonwealth and its citizens as well as the economy, general welfare and national security of the United States are inseparably related in the preservation and development of the motor vehicle industry in this Commonwealth and in other states of the United States. (5) The production of motor vehicles and motor vehicle components in Canada involves the use of a substantial amount of resources from the United States, including labor and materials. The General Assembly declares it to be the policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that public officers and agencies should aid and promote the development of the motor vehicle industry of North America to stimulate and improve the economic well-being of this Commonwealth and its citizens. (c) Purpose of subchapter.-- This subchapter is intended as remedial legislation designed to promote the general welfare and stimulate the economy of this Commonwealth and its people. Each provision shall receive a liberal construction to effectuate that intention. None of the provisions of this subchapter shall receive a strict or limited construction. References in Text. The act of April 4, 1982 (P.L.193, No.403), known as the Motor Vehicle Procurement Act, referred to in subsec. (b), was repealed by the act of May 15, 1998 (P.L.358, No.57).

For governmental units that are not required to take actions on contracts at public meetings, the governmental unit shall provide public notice of the award of the guaranteed energy savings contract within 30 days in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. The notice shall include the names of the parties to the contract and the purpose of the contract. For governmental units that are required to take actions on contracts at public meetings, the public notice shall be made at least ten days prior to the meeting. After reviewing the proposals pursuant to subsection (e), a governmental unit may enter into a guaranteed energy savings contract with a qualified provider if it finds that the amount it would spend on the energy conservation measures recommended in the proposal would not exceed the amount of energy, water or wastewater cost savings, operational cost savings or revenue increases resulting from the energy conservation measures within a period not to exceed 20 years from the date of final installation if the recommendations in the proposal were followed and the qualified provider provides a written guarantee that the energy, water or wastewater cost savings, or operational cost savings or revenue increases will meet or exceed the cost of the contract, provided, however, that, when determining the operational cost savings from any contract or project of the type defined in paragraphs (17), (18) and (19) of the definition of \"energy conservation measure\" in section 3752 (relating to definitions), the governmental unit shall not consider savings that result from reductions in the size of its work force if the reductions are related to or generated by outsourcing or using contract workers to perform tasks previously performed by employees of the governmental unit. (e) Report.-- (1) Before the award of a guaranteed energy savings contract, the qualified provider shall provide a report as part of its proposal which shall be available for public inspection, summarizing estimates of all costs of installation, maintenance, repairs and debt service and estimates of the amounts by which energy or operating costs will be reduced. (2) The report shall contain a listing of contractors and subcontractors to be used by the qualified provider with respect to the energy conservation measures. (f) Bond.-- A qualified provider to whom a contract is awarded shall give a sufficient bond to the governmental unit for its faithful performance. Commonwealth agencies shall obtain such bonds in accordance with the provisions of section 533 (relating to security and performance bonds). All other governmental units shall obtain such bonds in accordance with the act of December 20, 1967 (P.L.869, No.385), known as the Public Works Contractors' Bond Law of 1967. (g) Award of contract.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing the letting of public contracts, a governmental unit may enter into a single guaranteed energy savings contract with each responsible provider selected in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.

(b) Existing cooperatives.-- Except as provided in subsection (c), sections 4106, 4107, 4203 (relating to construction and validity of declaration and bylaws), 4219 (relating to master associations), 4220 (relating to merger or consolidation of cooperatives), 4302(a)(1) through (6) and (11) through (17) (relating to powers of association), 4311 (relating to tort and contract liability), 4315 (relating to lien for assessments), 4317 (relating to association records), 4319 (relating to termination of cooperative interest), 4409 (relating to resales of cooperative interests) and 4415 (relating to effect of violations on rights of action), and section 4103 (relating to definitions) to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subpart and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. By compliance with the requirements of section 4201 (relating to creation of cooperative ownership), a cooperative created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart may be made subject to all of the provisions of this subpart, effective as of the date of recordation of the document or documents specified in section 4201, without in any way terminating the cooperative status of the property or in any way affecting any lien or encumbrance on the property, if the terms of such document or documents have been approved by all the persons whose actions would have been required to effect the termination of the cooperative pursuant to its governing documents in effect at the time such approval is given, provided, however, that such action shall not increase the obligations or responsibilities of a declarant, as such and not as a proprietary lessee, without the joinder of the declarant in the document or documents required by section 4201. (b.1) Retroactivity.-- (1) Sections 4103, 4108 (relating to supplemental general principles of law applicable), 4112 (relating to obligation of good faith), 4216 (relating to amendment of declaration), 4217(g) (relating to termination of cooperative ownership), 4302(a)(8)(i) and (9), 4303(a), (b) and (c) (relating to executive board members and officers), 4307 (relating to upkeep of cooperative), 4314 (relating to assessments for common expenses) and 4316 (relating to other liens affecting cooperative), to the extent necessary in construing any of those sections, apply to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but those sections apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this subsection and do not invalidate existing provisions of the cooperative documents of those cooperatives. (2) Section 4303(d), to the extent necessary in construing that subsection, applies to all cooperatives created in this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart, but the subsection applies only with respect to events and circumstances occurring 180 days after the effective date of this subsection and does not invalidate specific provisions contained in existing provisions of the declaration, bylaws or plats and plans of those cooperatives. (c) Units restricted to nonresidential use.-- If a cooperative created within this Commonwealth before the effective date of this subpart contains only units restricted to nonresidential use, it is subject only to sections 4106 and 4107 unless the declaration is amended in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements of the declaration to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (d), in which case all the sections enumerated in subsection (b) apply to that cooperative from the date such amended declaration is recorded as required for a declaration under section 4201. (d) Amendments to declaration and bylaws.-- In the case of amendments to the declaration and bylaws of any cooperative created before the effective date of this subpart: (1) If the result accomplished by the amendment was permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made either in accordance with that law, in which case that law applies to that amendment, or may be made pursuant to this subpart. (2) If the result accomplished by the amendment is permitted by this subpart and was not permitted by law prior to this subpart, the amendment may be made pursuant to this subpart. An amendment to the declaration or bylaws authorized by this subsection to be made under this subpart must be adopted in conformity with applicable law and with the procedures and requirements specified by the declaration and bylaws being amended. If any such amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this subpart, all correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions in this subpart also apply to that person. (e) Cooperative interests outside Commonwealth.-- This subpart does not apply to cooperative interests located outside this Commonwealth, but the public offering statement provisions (sections 4401 through 4408) apply to all cooperative interests offered within this Commonwealth for which either the contract for disposition is executed by any party within this Commonwealth or the disposition is effectuated within this Commonwealth unless exempt under section 4401(b) (relating to applicability; waiver). (f) Liens and security interests.-- The enactment of this subpart shall not affect any lien upon a cooperative or any lien upon or security interest in any property of the association or in any cooperative interest if such lien or security interest shall have been perfected prior to the effective date of this subpart.

(2) The department has certified that it developed a program plan based on the assessment conducted under paragraph (1) that is designed to reduce the risk of recidivism through the use of recidivism risk reduction incentive programs authorized and approved under this chapter that are appropriate for that particular inmate. (3) The department advised the inmate that the inmate is required to successfully complete the program plan. (4) The inmate has successfully completed all required recidivism risk reduction incentive programs or other programs designated in the program plan. (5) The inmate has maintained a good conduct record following the imposition of the recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum sentence. (6) The reentry plan for the inmate is adequate. (7) Individual conditions and requirements for parole have been established. (8) Notice and opportunity to be heard was provided by the board to the sentencing court and the prosecuting attorney in a manner consistent with section 6137(g)(2) (relating to parole power). (9) The department has certified that the inmate continues to be an eligible offender. In the event that a recidivism risk reduction minimum sentence was imposed under section 4505(b) (relating to sentencing), the department certifies that it has not received additional information demonstrating a history of past or present violent behavior which was not available at the time of sentencing and the prosecuting attorney was unaware of that information at the time of sentencing. (10) There is no reasonable indication that the inmate poses a risk to public safety. (b) Funding.-- The department shall make all reasonable efforts to seek appropriate funding and resources in order to implement the recidivism risk reduction program. (c) Program content.-- Nothing in this section shall do any of the following: (1) Require the department to include recidivism risk reduction programs in an individual program plan where the risk assessment indicates that such a program is unlikely to reduce recidivism for that particular inmate. (2) Prohibit the department from including appropriate community works or public service projects as part of the program plan. (3) Prohibit the department from making modifications to the program plan at any time in order to ensure appropriate treatment and recidivism risk reduction incentive program placement.

(a) Right to protest.-- A bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror or a prospective contractor that is aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract, except as provided in section 521 (relating to cancellation of invitations for bids or requests for proposals), may protest to the head of the purchasing agency in writing. (b) Filing of protest.-- If the protestant is a bidder or offeror or a prospective contractor, the protest shall be filed with the head of the purchasing agency within seven days after the aggrieved bidder or offeror or prospective contractor knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the protest except that in no event may a protest be filed later than seven days after the date the contract was awarded. If the protestant is a prospective bidder or offeror, a protest shall be filed with the head of the purchasing agency prior to the bid opening time or the proposal receipt date. If a bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror or a prospective contractor fails to file a protest or files an untimely protest, the bidder or offeror, the prospective bidder or offeror or the prospective contractor shall be deemed to have waived its right to protest the solicitation or award of the contract in any forum. Untimely filed protests shall be disregarded by the purchasing agency. (c) Contents of protest.-- A protest shall state all grounds upon which the protestant asserts the solicitation or award of the contract was improper. The protestant may submit with the protest any documents or information it deems relevant to the protest. (d) Response and reply.-- Within 15 days of receipt of a protest, the contracting officer may submit to the head of the purchasing agency and the protestant a response to the protest, including any documents or information he deems relevant to the protest. The protestant may file a reply to the response within ten days of the date of the response. (e) Evaluation of protest.-- The head of the purchasing agency or his designee shall review the protest and any response or reply and may request and review such additional documents or information he deems necessary to render a decision and may, at his sole discretion, conduct a hearing. The head of the purchasing agency or his designee shall provide to the protestant and the contracting officer a reasonable opportunity to review and address any additional documents or information deemed necessary by the head of the purchasing agency or his designee to render a decision. (f) Determination.-- Upon completing an evaluation of the protest in accordance with subsection (e), the head of the purchasing agency or his designee shall issue a written determination stating the reasons for the decision. The determination shall be issued within 60 days of the receipt of the protest unless extended by consent of the head of the purchasing agency or his designee and the protestant. The determination shall be the final order of the purchasing agency. If the head of the purchasing agency or his designee determines that the solicitation or award of the contract was contrary to law, he may enter an order authorized by section 1711.2 (relating to solicitations or awards contrary to law). (g) Appeal.-- Within 15 days of the mailing date of a final determination denying a protest, a protestant may file an appeal with Commonwealth Court. Issues not raised by the protestant before the purchasing agency are deemed waived and may not be raised before the court. (h) Record of determination.-- The record of determination for review by the court shall consist of the solicitation or award; the contract, if any; the protest; any response or reply; any additional documents or information considered by the head of the purchasing agency or his designee; the hearing transcript and exhibits, if any; and the final determination. (i) Standard of review.-- The court shall hear the appeal, without a jury, on the record of determination certified by the purchasing agency. The court shall affirm the determination of the purchasing agency unless it finds from the record that the determination is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion or is contrary to law. (j) Remedy.-- If the determination is not affirmed, the court may enter any order authorized by 42 Pa.C.S. § 706 (relating to disposition of appeals), provided that, if the court determines that the solicitation or award of a contract is contrary to law, then the remedy the court shall order is limited to canceling the solicitation or award and declaring void any resulting contract. (k) Stay of procurement during pendency of protest.-- In the event a protest is filed timely under this section and until the time has elapsed for the protestant to file an appeal with Commonwealth Court, the purchasing agency shall not proceed further with the solicitation or with the award of the contract unless and until the head of the purchasing agency, after consultation with the head of the using agency, makes a written determination that the protest is clearly without merit or that award of the contract without delay is necessary to protect substantial interests of the Commonwealth. (l) Applicability.-- This section shall be the exclusive procedure for protesting a solicitation or award of a contract by a bidder or offeror, a prospective bidder or offeror or a prospective contractor that is aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract. The provisions of 2 Pa.C.S. (relating to administrative law and procedure) shall not apply to this section. (Dec. 3, 2002, P.L.1147, No.142, eff. imd.) 2002 Amendment. Act 142 added section 1711.1.
