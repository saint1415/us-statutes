The contractor shall also require the subcontractor to make similar payments to his subcontractors.\n\n(7) The department shall have the right to engage the services of any architect or consulting or supervising engineer or engineers whom it may deem necessary for the proper designing of or inspection or supervision of projects constructed, altered or enlarged by the department under this section in accordance with the selection procedures of section 905.\n\n(8) Changes in scope in the plans or specifications, or both, may be made after their approval only with the consent of the Governor and all of the Commonwealth agencies and State-related institutions whose approval of the original plans or specifications, or both, was necessary under this section.\n\n(9) If the appropriation is to a Commonwealth agency, other than the department or State-related institution, the department shall award and enter into the contract as agent for the Commonwealth agency or State-related institution to which the appropriation was made.\n\nReferences in Text.The act of May 20, 1937 (P.L.728, No.193), referred to as the Board of Claims Act, referred to in par.
