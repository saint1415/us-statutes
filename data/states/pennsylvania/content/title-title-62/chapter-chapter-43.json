The General Assembly therefore declares it to be the policy of this Commonwealth that all public officers and agencies should, at all times, make efforts to see that concessionaires in public facilities provide goods and services of high quality at reasonable prices in order to protect the public and encourage use of public facilities.\n\n(c) Police power.--This chapter shall be deemed to be an exercise of the police powers of this Commonwealth for the protection of the health, safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth.\n\n(d) Purpose of chapter.--This chapter is intended as remedial legislation designed to promote the general welfare, protect the public and encourage full and proper use of public facilities. Each provision of this chapter is intended to receive a liberal construction as will best effectuate those purposes, and no provision is intended to receive a strict or limited construction.\n\n(e) Certain rights preserved.--This chapter is not intended to limit or deny any other rights previously enjoyed by any government agency.\n\nReferences in Text.The act of November 26, 1978 (P.L.1303, No.315), known as the Public Facilities Concession Regulation Act, referred to in subsec. (b), was repealed by the act of May 15, 1998 (P.L.358, No.57). The subject matter is now contained in Chapter 43 of this title.",
