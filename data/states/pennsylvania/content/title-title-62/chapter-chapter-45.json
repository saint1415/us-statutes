For this purpose, the Attorney General or his representatives may sign subpoenas, administer oaths or affirmations, examine witnesses and receive evidence during the investigation. A request for information shall state the subject matter of the investigation, the conduct constituting the alleged violation which is under investigation and the provisions of this chapter applicable to the alleged violation. A request for documentary material shall describe the material to be produced with reasonable particularity so as to fairly identify the documents demanded, provide a return date within which the material is to be produced and identify the member of the Attorney General's staff to whom the material shall be given. In case of disobedience of a subpoena or the contumacy of a witness appearing before the Attorney General or his representative, the Attorney General or his representative may invoke the aid of a court of record of this Commonwealth, and the court may issue an order requiring the person subpoenaed to obey the subpoena or to give evidence or to produce books, accounts, papers, records, documents and files relative to the matter in question. Failure to obey an order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt.\n\n(b) Confidentiality.--No information or documentary material produced under a demand under this section shall, unless otherwise ordered by a court for good cause shown, be produced for inspection or copying by, nor shall the contents be disclosed to, a person other than the Attorney General or his representative without the consent of the person who produced the information or material. However, the Attorney General or his representative shall disclose information or documentary material produced under this section or information derived therefrom to officials of a government agency affected by the alleged violation, for use by that agency in connection with an investigation or proceeding within its jurisdiction and authority, upon the prior certification of an appropriate official of the agency that the information shall be maintained in confidence other than use for official purposes. Under reasonable terms and conditions as the Attorney General or his representative shall prescribe, the documentary material shall be available for inspection and copying by the person who produced the material or a duly authorized representative of that person. The Attorney General or his representative may use the documentary material or information or copies as he determines necessary in the civil enforcement of this chapter, including presentation before any court. Material which contains trade secrets or other highly confidential matter shall not be presented except with the approval of the court in which a proceeding is pending after adequate notice to the person furnishing the material.\n\n(c) Limitation on use.--No criminal prosecution under section 4503 (relating to prohibited activities) may be brought by either the Attorney General or a district attorney based solely upon information or documents obtained in a civil investigation under this section.",
