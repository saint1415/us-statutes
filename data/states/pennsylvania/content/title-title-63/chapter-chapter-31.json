The following shall apply:\n\n(1) The first stage of the analysis shall determine whether the criminal conviction directly relates to the occupation, trade or profession for which the individual seeks licensure by reviewing the schedule of offenses in section 3117 (relating to list of criminal offenses). If the offense is found on the list of offenses that are directly related to the occupation, trade or profession, the licensing board or licensing commission shall then determine whether licensure of the individual would pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of the individual's patients or clients or the public or a substantial risk of further criminal convictions by conducting the individualized assessment specified in subsection (c). There shall be a rebuttable presumption that licensure of the individual with a criminal conviction that directly relates to the occupation, trade or profession would pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of the individual's patients or clients or the public or a substantial risk of further criminal convictions. The individual may rebut the presumption by showing evidence of rehabilitation, as specified in the factors in subsection (c).\n\n(2) If, after reviewing the schedule of offenses in section 3117, the criminal conviction is determined not to be directly related to the occupation, trade or profession, the licensing board or licensing commission shall proceed to the second stage of the analysis of the criminal conviction. During the second stage of the analysis, the licensing board or licensing commission shall determine whether, due to the nature of the criminal conviction, licensure of the individual would pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of the individual's patients or clients or the public or a substantial risk of further criminal convictions. If so, the licensing board or licensing commission shall conduct the individualized assessment specified in subsection (c). The individual may rebut the determination by showing evidence of rehabilitation, as specified in the factors in subsection (c).\n\n(c) Individualized assessment.--A licensing board or licensing commission shall conduct an individualized assessment of the individual with respect to criminal convictions and rehabilitation. The licensing board or licensing commission shall only consider the following factors in order to determine whether the individual meets the requirements for issuance of a license, certificate, registration or permit under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2):\n\n(1) Whether the criminal conduct for which the individual was convicted involved an act or threat of harm against the individual. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"harm\" includes harm to the victim, the personal property of the victim or reputation of the victim.\n\n(2) The facts and circumstances surrounding the criminal conviction.\n\n(3) The number of criminal convictions.\n\n(4) Increase in age or maturity of the individual since the date of the criminal conviction.\n\n(5) The individual's criminal history or lack of criminal history after the date of conviction.\n\n(6) Successful completion of education and training activities, including those in a county correctional facility or the Department of Corrections.\n\n(7) References from employers or others, including personnel of the county correctional facility or the Department of Corrections.\n\n(8) Progress in personal rehabilitation since the conviction.\n\n(9) Whether the individual meets all other licensing qualifications of the applicable practice act, including any examination requirements.\n\n(10) The individual's criminal history, or lack of criminal history, after the date of the criminal conviction while engaged in the same or similar profession or occupation.\n\n(11) Any other factor deemed relevant to the licensing board or licensing commission regarding the fitness of the individual for licensure.\n\n(d) Sexual offenses.--When determining eligibility for licensure as a health care practitioner, a licensing board or licensing commission may not issue a license, registration, certificate or permit or otherwise allow an individual to practice as a health care practitioner if the individual has been convicted of a sexual offense.\n\n(e) Crimes of violence.--An individual convicted of a crime of violence as defined in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714 (relating to sentences for second and subsequent offenses) may be granted a license, registration, certificate or permit by a licensing board or licensing commission if all of the following apply:\n\n(1) If the individual was incarcerated, at least three years have elapsed since release from incarceration. The period of three years shall be tolled for a violation of parole.\n\n(2) If the individual is serving a sentence other than a period of confinement in a State or county correctional facility, at least three years have elapsed since imposition of sentence.\n\n(3) The individual has remained conviction-free during the periods specified in paragraph (1) or (2).\n\n(4) The individual demonstrates significant rehabilitation since the criminal conviction.\n\n(5) The licensing board or licensing commission determines, by using the factors in subsection (c), except for subsection (c)(8), that licensure of the individual does not pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of the individual's patients or clients or the public or a substantial risk of further criminal convictions.\n\n(f) Drug trafficking.--Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the provisions of the respective practice acts relating to felony drug convictions under the act of April 14, 1972 (P.L.233, No.64), known as The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, or a conviction for an offense under the laws of another jurisdiction which, if committed in this Commonwealth, would be a felony under the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, shall only apply to an individual who has been convicted of a drug trafficking offense.
