As used in this paragraph, the term \"continuing education\" includes any term similar in nature used by a licensing board or commission.\n\n(c) Restrictions.--\n\n(1) Decisions rendered by a licensing board or licensing commission on any exceptions to the decision of a hearing examiner or on an application for review in accordance with section 3105(d) to impose a civil penalty under this section shall require the same number of votes required for the licensing board or licensing commission to impose a civil penalty under any other act.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the powers and duties under any other act of a licensing board or licensing commission in disciplinary matters, except that a licensing board or licensing commission may not impose a civil penalty under any other act for the same violation for which a civil penalty has been imposed under this section.\n\n(d) Status of civil penalty.--A civil penalty, together with any associated fee, interest or cost, imposed under this section or imposed by a licensing board or licensing commission under another act shall be a judgment in favor of the bureau upon the person or the property of the person, whether real or personal, and including any after-acquired property, upon whom the civil penalty is imposed. The Attorney General shall be responsible for enforcing the judgments in courts of competent jurisdiction in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure).\n\n(e) Entry of judgment.--Within 60 months of the final disposition of a disciplinary case, if an unpaid civil penalty, fee, interest and cost of a licensee total $1,000 or more, the licensing board or licensing commission, or the respective agent of the licensing board or licensing commission, may transmit a copy of the final disposition to the prothonotary of the court of common pleas in the county where the licensee or property of the licensee upon whom the penalty, fee, interest and cost are imposed is located.

Notice may be sent by registered mail to the last known address of the licensee.\n\n(h) Exception to execution.--The lien shall have no effect upon any stock of goods, wares or merchandise regularly sold or leased in the ordinary course of business by the licensee against whom the lien has been entered, unless and until a writ of execution has been issued and a levy made upon the stock of goods, wares and merchandise.\n\n(i) Satisfaction.--Once a judgment is paid in full to the licensing board or licensing commission, or the respective agent of the licensing board or licensing commission, the licensing board or licensing commission, or the respective agent of the licensing board or licensing commission, shall, within 90 days, notify the prothonotary in writing of receipt of payment in full and request the judgment be noted as satisfied in full.\n\n(j) Applicability.--This section shall apply only to disciplinary proceedings commenced on or after August 31, 1993.\n\n(k) Definitions.--As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:\n\n\"Unlicensed practice.\"Any of the following:\n\n(1) Practicing a profession or occupation or operating a business for which a license, registration, certificate or permit is required without holding a valid, unexpired, unrevoked or unsuspended authority to do so.\n\n(2) Representing to the public or a person, through offerings, advertisements or the use of a title, that the individual is qualified to practice a profession, occupation or business for which a license, registration, certificate or permit is required without holding a valid, unexpired, unrevoked or unsuspended authority to do so.\n\n(Nov. 25, 2020, P.L.1189, No.116, eff. 60 days; Dec. 14, 2023, P.L.464, No.65, eff. 60 days)\n\n2023 Amendment.Act 65 amended subsec.

If the offense is found on the list of offenses that are directly related to the occupation, trade or profession, the licensing board or licensing commission shall then determine whether licensure of the individual would pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of the individual's patients or clients or the public or a substantial risk of further criminal convictions by conducting the individualized assessment specified in subsection (c). There shall be a rebuttable presumption that licensure of the individual with a criminal conviction that directly relates to the occupation, trade or profession would pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of the individual's patients or clients or the public or a substantial risk of further criminal convictions. The individual may rebut the presumption by showing evidence of rehabilitation, as specified in the factors in subsection (c).\n\n(2) If, after reviewing the schedule of offenses in section 3117, the criminal conviction is determined not to be directly related to the occupation, trade or profession, the licensing board or licensing commission shall proceed to the second stage of the analysis of the criminal conviction.

The licensing board or licensing commission shall only consider the following factors in order to determine whether the individual meets the requirements for issuance of a license, certificate, registration or permit under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2):\n\n(1) Whether the criminal conduct for which the individual was convicted involved an act or threat of harm against the individual.
