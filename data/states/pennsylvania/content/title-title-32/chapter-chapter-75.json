Such direction may provide for the subsequent issuance of the notes (referred to as \"renewal notes\") to refund the notes or renewal notes, which renewal notes shall, upon issuance thereof, evidence the borrowing, and may specify such other terms and conditions with respect to the notes and renewal notes thereby authorized for issuance as the issuing officials may determine and direct. Any issue of renewal notes may be in a principal amount sufficient to repay the principal of and accrued interest on, if any, the issue or issues of notes being refunded and to pay the financial costs relating to the renewal notes.\n\n(d) Funding bonds.--Outstanding notes evidencing the borrowings may be funded and retired by the issuance and sale of the bonds of the Commonwealth as authorized in this chapter.

If interest coupons are attached, they shall contain the facsimile signature of the State Treasurer.\n\n(j) Bond amortization.--The issuing officials shall provide for the amortization of the bonds in substantial and regular amounts over the term of the debt. The first retirement of principal shall be stated to mature prior to the expiration of a period of time equal to one-tenth of the time from the date of the first obligation issued to evidence the debt to the date of the expiration of the term of the debt. Retirements of principal shall be regular and substantial if made in annual or semiannual amounts whether by stated serial maturities or by mandatory sinking fund retirements.\n\n(k) Refunding bonds.--The issuing officials are authorized to provide, by resolution, for the issuance of refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter and then outstanding, either by voluntary exchange with the holders of the outstanding bonds, or to provide funds to redeem and retire the outstanding bonds with accrued interest, any premium payable thereon and the costs of issuance and retirement of bonds, at maturity or at any call date. The issuance of the refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof and the duties of the issuing officials in respect to the same shall be governed by the provisions of this section, insofar as they may be applicable.

All moneys paid into the Water Facilities Loan Redemption Fund and all of the moneys not necessary to pay accruing interest shall be invested by the Treasury Department in such securities as are provided by law for the investment of the sinking funds of the Commonwealth.\n\n(b) Purchase of bonds.--The board, with the approval of the Governor, is authorized at any time to use any of the moneys in the Water Facilities Loan Fund not necessary for the purposes of the referendum of November 3, 1981 for the purchase and retirement of all or any part of the bonds and notes issued the authority of this chapter. In the event that all or any part of the bonds and notes are purchased by the board, they shall be canceled and returned to the loan and transfer agent as canceled and paid bonds and notes and thereafter all payments of interest thereon shall cease and the canceled bonds, notes and coupons shall be destroyed within two years after cancellation in the presence of the issuing officials or their designees, and a certificate evidencing the destruction, satisfactory to the duly authorized loan and transfer agent of the Commonwealth shall be furnished to it. All canceled bonds, notes and coupons shall be so marked as to make the canceled bonds, notes and coupons nonnegotiable.\n\n(c) Reporting requirements.--The State Treasurer shall determine and report to the Secretary of the Budget by November of each year the amount of money necessary for the payment of interest on outstanding obligations and the principal of the obligations, if any, for the following fiscal year and the times and amounts of the payments.

In such case the rate of interest on a loan shall be equal to the maximum rate of interest calculable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder which will not cause the general obligation bonds and notes issued pursuant to this chapter to be deemed arbitrage bonds under the provisions of section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and all regulations promulgated thereunder. In the case of loans initially funded from the proceeds of notes and subsequently funded from renewal notes and bonds, the interest rate to be charged on the loans shall be established in accordance with the provisions of this subsection upon the sale of bonds or notes, as the case may be, for the loans.\n\n(f) Disposition of loan repayments and interest.--All loan repayments, payments of interest on loans made by the board or proceeds shall be transmitted to the State Treasurer for deposit into the General Fund of the Commonwealth.",
