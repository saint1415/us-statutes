In order to provide for and in connection with such temporary borrowings, the issuing officials are authorized in the name and on behalf of the Commonwealth to enter into any loan or credit agreement or agreements or other agreements with any banks or trust companies or other lending institutions or persons in the United States having power to enter into them, which agreements may contain such provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter as may be customary in such instruments and as may be authorized by the issuing officials.\n\n(c) Issuance of notes and renewal notes.--All temporary borrowings made under the authorization of this section shall be evidenced by notes of the Commonwealth, which shall be issued from time to time for such amounts that together with the notes outstanding and bonds issued pursuant to this chapter do not exceed $300,000,000, in such form and in such denominations, and subject to such terms and conditions of sale and issue, renewal, prepayment or redemption and maturity, rate or rates of interest and time of payment of interests, as the issuing officials shall direct and in accordance with this chapter. Such direction may provide for the subsequent issuance of the notes (referred to as \"renewal notes\") to refund the notes or renewal notes, which renewal notes shall, upon issuance thereof, evidence the borrowing, and may specify such other terms and conditions with respect to the notes and renewal notes thereby authorized for issuance as the issuing officials may determine and direct. Any issue of renewal notes may be in a principal amount sufficient to repay the principal of and accrued interest on, if any, the issue or issues of notes being refunded and to pay the financial costs relating to the renewal notes.\n\n(d) Funding bonds.--Outstanding notes evidencing the borrowings may be funded and retired by the issuance and sale of the bonds of the Commonwealth as authorized in this chapter. The funding bonds must be issued and sold not later than a date three years after the date of the issuance of the first notes evidencing the borrowings to the extent that payment of the notes has not otherwise been made or provided for by sources other than proceeds of renewal notes.\n\n(e) Issuance of general obligation bonds.--As evidence of the indebtedness authorized in this chapter, general obligation bonds of the Commonwealth shall be issued from time to time to fund and retire notes issued pursuant to this chapter (referred to as \"funding bonds\") or to provide moneys necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, or both, for such total amounts, in such form, in such denominations and subject to such terms and conditions of issue, redemption and maturity, rate of interest and time of payment of interest as the issuing officials direct except that the latest stated maturity date shall not exceed 30 years from the date of the debt first issued for each series.\n\n(f) Execution of bonds.--All bonds and notes issued under the authority of this chapter shall bear facsimile signatures of the issuing officials and a facsimile of the great seal of the Commonwealth and shall be countersigned by a duly authorized officer of a duly authorized loan and transfer agent of the Commonwealth.\n\n(g) Direct obligation of Commonwealth.--All bonds and notes issued in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be direct obligations of the Commonwealth and the full faith and credit of the Commonwealth are hereby pledged for the payment of the interest thereon as it becomes due and the payment of the principal at maturity. The principal of and interest on the bonds and notes shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America.\n\n(h) Exemption from taxation.--All bonds and notes issued under the provisions of this section shall be exempt from taxation for State and local purposes.\n\n(i) Form of bonds.--The bonds may be issued as coupon bonds or registered as to both principal and interest as the issuing officials may determine. If interest coupons are attached, they shall contain the facsimile signature of the State Treasurer.\n\n(j) Bond amortization.--The issuing officials shall provide for the amortization of the bonds in substantial and regular amounts over the term of the debt. The first retirement of principal shall be stated to mature prior to the expiration of a period of time equal to one-tenth of the time from the date of the first obligation issued to evidence the debt to the date of the expiration of the term of the debt. Retirements of principal shall be regular and substantial if made in annual or semiannual amounts whether by stated serial maturities or by mandatory sinking fund retirements.\n\n(k) Refunding bonds.--The issuing officials are authorized to provide, by resolution, for the issuance of refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter and then outstanding, either by voluntary exchange with the holders of the outstanding bonds, or to provide funds to redeem and retire the outstanding bonds with accrued interest, any premium payable thereon and the costs of issuance and retirement of bonds, at maturity or at any call date. The issuance of the refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof and the duties of the issuing officials in respect to the same shall be governed by the provisions of this section, insofar as they may be applicable. Refunding bonds, which are not subject to the aggregate limitation of $300,000,000 of bonds to be issued pursuant to this chapter, may be issued by the issuing officials to refund bonds originally issued or to refund bonds previously issued for refunding purposes.\n\n(l) Quorum.--Whenever any action is to be taken or decision made by the Governor, the Auditor General and the State Treasurer acting as issuing officials and the three officers are not able unanimously to agree, the action or decision of the Governor and either the Auditor General or State Treasurer shall be binding and final.",

      "text": "(a) Water Facilities Loan Redemption Fund.--All bonds issued under the authority of this chapter shall be redeemed at maturity and all interest due from time to time on the bonds shall be paid from a special fund to be known as the \"Water Facilities Loan Redemption Fund.\" For the specific purpose of redeeming the bonds at maturity and paying all interest thereon in accordance with the information received from the Governor, the General Assembly shall appropriate moneys to the Water Facilities Loan Redemption Fund for the payment of interest on the bonds and the principal thereof at maturity. All moneys paid into the Water Facilities Loan Redemption Fund and all of the moneys not necessary to pay accruing interest shall be invested by the Treasury Department in such securities as are provided by law for the investment of the sinking funds of the Commonwealth.\n\n(b) Purchase of bonds.--The board, with the approval of the Governor, is authorized at any time to use any of the moneys in the Water Facilities Loan Fund not necessary for the purposes of the referendum of November 3, 1981 for the purchase and retirement of all or any part of the bonds and notes issued the authority of this chapter. In the event that all or any part of the bonds and notes are purchased by the board, they shall be canceled and returned to the loan and transfer agent as canceled and paid bonds and notes and thereafter all payments of interest thereon shall cease and the canceled bonds, notes and coupons shall be destroyed within two years after cancellation in the presence of the issuing officials or their designees, and a certificate evidencing the destruction, satisfactory to the duly authorized loan and transfer agent of the Commonwealth shall be furnished to it. All canceled bonds, notes and coupons shall be so marked as to make the canceled bonds, notes and coupons nonnegotiable.\n\n(c) Reporting requirements.--The State Treasurer shall determine and report to the Secretary of the Budget by November of each year the amount of money necessary for the payment of interest on outstanding obligations and the principal of the obligations, if any, for the following fiscal year and the times and amounts of the payments. It shall be the duty of the Governor to include in every budget submitted to the General Assembly full information relating to the issuance of bonds and notes under the provisions of this chapter and the status of the sinking fund of the Commonwealth for the payment of the interest on the bonds and notes and the principal thereof at maturity.\n\n(d) Debt service appropriations.--The General Assembly shall appropriate an amount equal to moneys as may be necessary to meet repayment obligations for principal and interest into the Water Facilities Loan Redemption Fund.\n\n(e) Interest rate on loans.--In no case shall the rate of interest on any loan made pursuant to this chapter be less than the rate of interest paid by the Commonwealth on the general obligation bonds or notes issued pursuant to this chapter from which funds were obtained for the loan except when that rate of interest would exceed the maximum permissible rate of interest under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder so as to cause the general obligation bonds issued pursuant to this chapter to be deemed arbitrage bonds pursuant to section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In such case the rate of interest on a loan shall be equal to the maximum rate of interest calculable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder which will not cause the general obligation bonds and notes issued pursuant to this chapter to be deemed arbitrage bonds under the provisions of section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and all regulations promulgated thereunder. In the case of loans initially funded from the proceeds of notes and subsequently funded from renewal notes and bonds, the interest rate to be charged on the loans shall be established in accordance with the provisions of this subsection upon the sale of bonds or notes, as the case may be, for the loans.\n\n(f) Disposition of loan repayments and interest.--All loan repayments, payments of interest on loans made by the board or proceeds shall be transmitted to the State Treasurer for deposit into the General Fund of the Commonwealth.",
