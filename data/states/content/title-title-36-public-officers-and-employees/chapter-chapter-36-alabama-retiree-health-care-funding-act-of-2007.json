      "text": "Section 36-36-1\n\nLegislative Findings.\n\nThe Legislature of Alabama hereby finds and determines that the funding of accrued and accruing health care benefits to retired employees and their dependents is a proper governmental function and purpose of the state. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board has issued Statements 43 and 45, which set forth standards on accounting and reporting for post-employment benefits other than pensions by governments. The new standards will require the state to account for such post-employment benefits on an actuarial basis during an employee’s career rather than on a pay-as-you-go basis during the employee’s period of retirement. The Legislature has determined that it would be advisable for the state to create irrevocable trusts whereby the state may begin funding those benefits in advance to address and ultimately offset the state’s accrued liabilities for such benefits. Therefore, the state, the State Employees’ Insurance Board, and the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Board are authorized and directed to create irrevocable trusts to be named the “Alabama Retired State Employees’ Health Care Trust” and the “Alabama Retired Education Employees’ Health Care Trust,” respectively, which shall be created, funded, and administered in accordance with the provisions of this chapter to protect and enhance the financial condition of the State.\n\n(Act 2007-16, 1st Sp. Sess., p. 25, §1.)",

The Legislature shall have no authority or power to appropriate the assets of the trusts.\n\n(d) During each fiscal year, distributions from a trust to provide post-employment health care benefits to or for retired employees and their dependents shall not exceed 10 percent of the fair market value of the assets of such trust as of the last business day of the immediately preceding fiscal year. No distribution from a trust to provide post-employment health care benefits to or for retired employees and their dependents shall be made during the first fiscal year of the trust.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the above, as long as such amendment is consistent with the legislative intent of this chapter, the trustees of the trusts shall have the authority to amend or modify their respective trust: (1) if, in the opinion of counsel for the trustees of the respective trust, it is necessary or otherwise advisable to obtain any material tax advantage or avoid any material adverse tax result; (2) if, in the opinion of the independent accountant for the trustees of the respective trust, it is necessary or otherwise advisable to cause the trust to be considered another post-employment benefits trust in accordance with generally accepted governmental accounting principles, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board or its successor; or (3) if, in response to a petition of the respective trustees of the trust requesting that the trust be amended, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such amendment is necessary or otherwise advisable to accomplish one or more purposes of this chapter.\n\n(f) The trusts may be terminated by the boards only if all state plans or programs providing such post-employment health care benefits for which the trust is established are repealed or terminated and there is no future obligation of the state to provide such post-employment health care benefits. In such event, the then remaining assets of the trust shall revert, in the case of the Alabama Retired State Employees’ Health Care Trust, to the State Treasury to and for the credit of the State Employees’ Insurance Board and, in the case of the Alabama Retired Education Employees’ Health Care Trust, to the State Treasury to and for the credit of the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Board.\n\n(g) All assets and income of the trusts shall be exempt from taxation by the state or any political subdivision thereof.
