      "text": "§\n\n 1;§\n\n4702. Legislative findings and purpose.The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:(1) Delaware’s communities are important to the social and economic vitality of Delaware. Whether urban, suburban, or rural, many Delaware communities are struggling to cope with unoccupied properties or properties incapable of lawful occupation. These vacant and abandoned properties represent lost revenue to local governments and significant expenses associated with demolition, safety hazards, increased calls for emergency services, and deterioration of neighborhoods.(2) The need exists to strengthen and revitalize Delaware’s economy and address the associated harms that result from high numbers of vacant and abandoned properties. Solving these problems requires a coordinated effort to foster the development of such property back into productive use and promote economic growth. Such problems may include multiple taxing jurisdictions lacking common policies; ineffective property inspection; code enforcement and property rehabilitation support; lengthy or inadequate collection proceedings; depressed real estate markets; and lack of coordination and resources to support economic revitalization.(3) There is an overriding public need to confront the problems caused by vacant, abandoned, and delinquent properties through the creation of new tools to be available to communities throughout Delaware enabling them to turn vacant spaces into vibrant places.(4) Land banks are one of the tools currently utilized by other communities to facilitate the return of vacant, abandoned and delinquent properties to productive use. This chapter enables the creation of land banks in order to return dilapidated and blighted properties to productive use in Delaware.80 Del. Laws, c. 155,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n4703.

An entire county.b. A foreclosing governmental unit, or a combination of foreclosing governmental units that have formed a single land bank by intergovernmental agreement pursuant to § 4705(b) of this title, that in total covers an area with a population in excess of 30,000 persons.(5) “Liens” means any lien set forth in § 2901(a)(1) of Title 25.(6) “Vacancy rate” means the percentage of residential structures that have been uninhabited for 6 months or more within a given jurisdiction.80 Del.

In the event that a land bank is created pursuant to an agreement in accordance with this subsection, such agreement shall also specify the matters identified in subsection (a) of this section.(c) In the event a county creates a land bank, such land bank shall have the power to acquire real property only in those portions of such county located outside of the geographical boundaries of any other land bank created by any other foreclosing governmental unit located partially or entirely within such county.80 Del.
