Discovery as provided for in Article 5 of Chapter 11 of this title shall not be allowed; however, prior to trial any party may apply to the court to allow for such discovery, and if discovery is allowed, the court may provide for the scope and duration of discovery and may continue the trial to a date not more than 60 days after the end of the discovery period unless continued by the court for good cause shown.(g)On a determination of liability of a person for conduct giving rise to forfeiture, the court shall enter a judgment of forfeiture of the property described in the complaint and shall also authorize the state attorney or his or her agent or any law enforcement officer or peace officer to seize all property ordered to be forfeited which was not previously seized or was not then under seizure. Following the entry of an order declaring the property forfeited, the court, on application of the state attorney, may enter any appropriate order to protect the interest of the state in the property ordered to be forfeited.Added by 2015 Ga.
