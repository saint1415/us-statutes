The term “displaced person” does not include a person who has been determined, according to criteria established by the state agency, to be either in unlawful occupancy of the displacement dwelling or to have occupied the dwelling for the purpose of obtaining assistance under this chapter, or in any case which the state agency acquires property for a program or project, any person, other than a person who was an occupant of the property at the time it was acquired, who occupies the property on a rental basis for a short term or a period subject to termination when the property is needed for the program or project.\n\n(3) MORTGAGE. The classes of liens as are commonly given to secure advances on, or the unpaid purchase price of, real property, together with the credit instruments, if any, secured by the mortgage.\n\n(4) PERSON.

In order that the persons shall not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole, the policy shall be uniform as to relocation payments, advisory assistance, and assurances of availability of housing.\n\n(2) It shall be the policy of the state to encourage and expedite the acquisition of real property by agreements with owners, to avoid litigation and relieve congestion in the courts, to assure consistent treatment for owners in the many programs, and to promote public confidence in land acquisition practices.\n\n(Act 99-582, p. 1318, §§3, 4.)",

In no event shall the amount be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property by the agency. Any decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property prior to the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which the property is acquired, or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, will be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The agency concerned shall provide the owner of the real property to be acquired with a written statement and summary of the basis for the amount it established as just compensation. Where appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated.\n\n(4) No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property before the state agency pays the agreed purchase price, or deposits with the state court in accordance with applicable law, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property by the agency, or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for such property.\n\n(5) The construction or development of a public improvement shall be scheduled so that, to the greatest extent practicable, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling, if a replacement dwelling will be available, without at least 90 days written notice from the agency concerned of the date by which the move is required.\n\n(6) If the agency permits an owner or tenant to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term for a period subject to termination by the state agency on a short notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier.\n\n(7) The agency should either advance the time of condemnation or defer negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner, or take any other action coercive in nature, in order to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property.\n\n(8) If any interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, the agency concerned shall institute formal condemnation proceedings. No agency shall intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his or her real property.\n\n(9) If the acquisition of only part of a property would leave its owner with an uneconomic remnant, the agency concerned shall offer to acquire the entire property.\n\n(Act 99-582, p. 1318, §15.)",
