Sess., p. 643, §1.)",

Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the state or a municipal or county governing body from exercising the power of eminent domain for the purpose of constructing, maintaining, or operating streets and roadways, government buildings, or park and recreation facilities.\n\n(b) Property condemned by an entity described in subsection (a), if not ever used for the purpose or purposes for which it was condemned or for some other public use, that is subsequently determined to be sold, shall be first offered for sale to the person or persons from whom the property was condemned, or his or her known or ascertainable heirs or assigns, at the price which was paid for the property, less such amount, if any, as the person shall show by good and sufficient documentation to be the amount of income and transaction taxes, if any, actually paid in connection therewith, and if the offer shall not be accepted within 90 days from the date it is made, the property may be sold to any other person or persons but only at public sale after legal notice is given.\n\n(Act 2005-313, 1st Sp. Sess., p. 643, §3; Act 2015-39, §1.)",
