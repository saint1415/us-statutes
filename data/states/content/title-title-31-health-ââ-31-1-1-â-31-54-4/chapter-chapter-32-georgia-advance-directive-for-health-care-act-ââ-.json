If what I would decide is still unclear, then my health care agent should make decisions for me that my health care agent believes are in my best interest, considering the benefits, burdens, and risks of my current circumstances and treatment options.\n\nMy health care agent will have the power to authorize an autopsy of my body unless I have limited my health care agent's power by initialing below.\n\n__________________ (Initials) My health care agent will not have the power to authorize an autopsy of my body (unless an autopsy is required by law).\n\nMy health care agent will have the power to make a disposition of any part or all of my body for medical purposes pursuant to the Georgia Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, unless I have limited my health care agent's power by initialing below.\n\n[Initial each statement that you want to apply.]\n\n__________________ (Initials) My health care agent will not have the power to make a disposition of my body for use in a medical study program.\n\n__________________ (Initials) My health care agent will not have the power to donate any of my organs.\n\nMy health care agent will have the power to make decisions about the final disposition of my body unless I have initialed below.\n\n__________________ (Initials) I want the following person to make decisions about the final disposition of my body:\n\nName: __________________\n\nAddress: __________________\n\nTelephone Numbers: __________________\n\n(Home, Work, and Mobile)\n\nI wish for my body to be:\n\n__________________ (Initials) Buried\n\n__________________ (Initials) Cremated\n\nPART TWO: TREATMENT PREFERENCES\n\n[PART TWO will be effective only if you are unable to communicate your treatment preferences after reasonable and appropriate efforts have been made to communicate with you about your treatment preferences. PART TWO will be effective even if PART ONE is not completed. If you have not selected a health care agent in PART ONE, or if your health care agent is not available, then PART TWO will provide your physician and other health care providers with your treatment preferences. If you have selected a health care agent in PART ONE, then your health care agent will have the authority to make all health care decisions for you regarding matters covered by PART TWO. Your health care agent will be guided by your treatment preferences and other factors described in Section (4) of PART ONE.]\n\nPART TWO will be effective if I am in any of the following conditions:\n\n[Initial each condition in which you want PART TWO to be effective.]\n\n__________________ (Initials) A terminal condition, which means I have an incurable or irreversible condition that will result in my death in a relatively short period of time.\n\n__________________ (Initials) A state of permanent unconsciousness, which means I am in an incurable or irreversible condition in which I am not aware of myself or my environment and I show no behavioral response to my environment.\n\nMy condition will be determined in writing after personal examination by my attending physician and a second physician in accordance with currently accepted medical standards.\n\n[State your treatment preference by initialing (A), (B), or (C).

This section allows you to state additional treatment preferences, to provide additional guidance to your health care agent (if you have selected a health care agent in PART ONE), or to provide information about your personal and religious values about your medical treatment. For example, you may want to state your treatment preferences regarding medications to fight infection, surgery, amputation, blood transfusion, or kidney dialysis. Understanding that you cannot foresee everything that could happen to you after you can no longer communicate your treatment preferences, you may want to provide guidance to your health care agent (if you have selected a health care agent in PART ONE) about following your treatment preferences. You may want to state your specific preferences regarding pain relief.]\n\n__________________\n\n__________________\n\n__________________\n\n[PART TWO will be effective even if this section is left blank.]\n\nI understand that under Georgia law, PART TWO generally will have no force and effect if I am pregnant unless the fetus is not viable and I indicate by initialing below that I want PART TWO to be carried out.\n\n__________________ (Initials) I want PART TWO to be carried out if my fetus is not viable.\n\nPART THREE: GUARDIANSHIP\n\n[PART THREE is optional.This advance directive for health care will be effective even if PART THREE is left blank. If you wish to nominate a person to be your guardian in the event a court decides that a guardian should be appointed, complete PART THREE. A court will appoint a guardian for you if the court finds that you are not able to make significant responsible decisions for yourself regarding your personal support, safety, or welfare. A court will appoint the person nominated by you if the court finds that the appointment will serve your best interest and welfare. If you have selected a health care agent in PART ONE, you may (but are not required to) nominate the same person to be your guardian. If your health care agent and guardian are not the same person, your health care agent will have priority over your guardian in making your health care decisions, unless a court determines otherwise.]\n\n[State your preference by initialing (A) or (B).
