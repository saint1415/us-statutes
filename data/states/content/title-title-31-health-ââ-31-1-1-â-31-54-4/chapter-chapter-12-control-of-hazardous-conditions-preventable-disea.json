In light of these concerns, and in order to secure public health and national security, the United States government has launched, and the State of Georgia has cooperated in, a smallpox vaccination and treatment program, with a recommendation for initial smallpox vaccinations for certain hospitals, health care workers, and emergency response workers. However, due to the virulent nature of smallpox and its vaccine, participation by hospitals and health care workers in such a program potentially increases their exposure to liability that, without sufficient legal protections, may significantly discourage their participation in the program. The federal government has determined, and the General Assembly agrees, that liability protection for those hospitals and health care workers who participate in such programs are integral to ensuring its maximum success. Accordingly, to achieve a potent and widespread smallpox vaccination and treatment program and maintain an effective defense against possible terrorist attacks, it is critical that hospitals and health care workers participating in such program be protected from potential legal liability absent their gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.

Laws 102,§ 1-5, eff. 7/1/2009.\n\n(a)The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the state to provide for cancer research programs. In addition to and as a supplement to traditional financing mechanisms for such programs, it is the policy of this state to enable and encourage citizens voluntarily to support such programs.(b)To support programs for cancer research, the department may, without limitation, promote and solicit voluntary contributions through the individual income tax return contribution mechanism established in subsection (e) of this Code section or through any fund raising or other promotional techniques deemed appropriate by the department.(c)There is established a special fund to be known as the \"Cancer Research Program Fund.\" This fund shall consist of all moneys contributed under subsection (b) of this Code section, all moneys transferred to the department under subsection (e) of this Code section, and any other moneys contributed to this fund. All balances in the fund shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account identifying the fund and shall be carried forward each year so that no part thereof may be deposited in the general treasury. The fund shall be administered and the moneys held in the fund shall be expended by the department through contracts for cancer research conducted in Georgia.(d)Contributions to the fund shall be deemed supplemental to and shall in no way supplant funding that would otherwise be appropriated for these purposes. Contributions shall only be used for research and for administrative costs authorized in paragraph (2) of subsection (e) of this Code section and shall not be used for personnel or administrative positions. The department shall prepare, by February 1 of each year, an accounting of the moneys received and expended from the fund and a review and evaluation of all expended moneys of the fund. The report shall be made available to the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the members of the Board of Public Health, and, upon request, to members of the public.(e)(1)Unless an earlier date is deemed feasible and is established by the Governor, each Georgia individual income tax return form for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2000, shall contain appropriate language, to be determined by the state revenue commissioner, offering the taxpayer the opportunity to contribute to the Cancer Research Program Fund established in subsection (c) of this Code section by either donating all or any part of any tax refund due, by authorizing a reduction in the refund check otherwise payable, or by contributing any amount over and above any amount of tax owed by adding that amount to the taxpayer's payment. The instructions accompanying the individual income tax return form shall contain a description of the purposes for which this fund was established and the intended use of moneys received from the contributions. Each taxpayer required to file a state individual income tax return who desires to contribute to such fund may designate such contribution as provided in this Code section on the appropriate individual income tax return form.(2)The Department of Revenue shall determine annually the total amount so contributed, shall withhold therefrom a reasonable amount for administering this voluntary contribution program, and shall transmit the balance to the department for deposit in the fund established in subsection (c) of this Code section; provided, however, that the amount retained for administrative costs, including implementation costs, shall not exceed $50,000.00 per year. If, in any tax year, the administrative costs of the Department of Revenue for collecting contributions pursuant to this Code section exceed the sum of such contributions, the administrative costs which the Department of Revenue is authorized to withhold from such contributions shall not exceed the sum of such contributions.Amended by 2011 Ga.
