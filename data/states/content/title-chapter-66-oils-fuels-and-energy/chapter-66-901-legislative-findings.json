      "text": "findings.The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the use of solar energy and wind energy in Nebraska: (1) Can help reduce the nation's reliance upon irreplaceable domestic and imported fossil fuels; (2) can reduce air and water pollution resulting from the use of conventional energy sources; (3) requires effective legislation and efficient administration of state and local programs to be of greatest value to its citizens; and (4) is of such importance to the public health, safety, and welfare that the state should take appropriate action to encourage its use.As the use of solar energy and wind energy devices increases, the possibility of future shading and obstruction of such devices by structures or vegetation will also increase. The Legislature therefor declares that the purpose of sections 66-901 to 66-914 is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare by protecting access to solar energy and wind energy as provided in sections 66-901 to 66-914.SourceLaws 1979, LB 353, § 1;Laws 1997, LB 140, § 1;Laws 2012, LB828, § 1.",
