The proposed budget,\nfinancial plan, and five-year capital program shall be based on the\nRegional Transportation Authority's estimate of funds to be made available to\nthe Authority by or through the Regional Transportation Authority and shall\nconform in all respects to the requirements established by the Regional\nTransportation Authority. The proposed budget, financial plan, and five-year capital program shall contain a\nstatement of the funds estimated to be on hand at the beginning of the fiscal\nyear, the funds estimated to be received from all sources for such year and the\nfunds estimated to be on hand at the end of such year.

The amended budget ordinance shall be\nresubmitted to the Regional Transportation Authority pursuant to said Section\n4.11.
