The Commission may sell, convey, transfer, or lease, all at fair market value, any title or interest in real property owned by it to any person or persons, to be used, subject to the restrictions of this Act, for the purposes stated in Section 25, for the purpose of serving persons using the facilities offered within the District, or for carrying out of any aspect of the Commission's purposes as set forth in Section 10 of this Act, subject to the restrictions as to the use of the real property as the Commission determines will carry out the purpose of this Act. To assure that the use of the real property sold or leased under this Section is in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the Commission shall inquire into and satisfy itself concerning the financial ability of the purchaser to complete the project for which the real property is sold or leased in accordance with a plan to be presented by the purchaser or lessee, which plan shall be submitted, in writing, to the Commission. Under the plan, the purchaser or lessee shall undertake (i) to use the land for the purposes designated in the presented plan; (ii) to commence and complete the construction of the buildings or other structures to be included in the project within the periods of time as the Commission fixes as reasonable; and (iii) to comply with any other conditions as the Commission shall determine are necessary to carry out the project. All conveyances and leases authorized in this Section shall be on condition that, in the event of use for other than the purposes prescribed in this Act, or of nonuse for a period of one year, title to the property reverts to the Commission. All conveyances and leases made by the Commission to any corporation or person for the use of serving the residents or any person using the facilities offered within the District shall be on condition that in the event of violation of any of the restrictions as to the use of the property as the Commission shall have determined will carry out the purposes of this Act, that title to the property reverts to the Commission. If, however, the Commission finds that financing necessary for the acquisition or lease of any real estate or for the construction of any building or improvement to be used for purposes prescribed in this Act cannot be obtained if title to the land, building, or improvement is subject to such a reverter provision, the finding shall be made by the Commission after a public hearing held pursuant to a single publication notice given in a secular newspaper of general circulation in Cook County at least 10 days before the date of the hearing, the notice to specify the time, place, and purpose for the hearing, and upon that finding being made, the Commission may cause the real property to be conveyed free of a reverter provision, provided that at least 7 members of the Commission vote in favor thereof. The Commission may also provide in the conveyances, leases, or other documentation provisions for notice of such violations or default and the cure thereof for the benefit of any lender or mortgagee as the Commission shall determine are appropriate. If, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the Commission resolves that a parcel of real estate leased by it, or in which it has sold the fee simple title or any lesser estate, is not being used for the purposes prescribed in this Act or has been in nonuse for a period of one year, the Commission may file a lawsuit in the circuit court of Cook County to enforce the terms of the sale or lease. If a reverter of title to any property is ordered by the court under the terms of this Act, the interest of the Commission shall be subject to any then existing valid mortgage or trust deed in the nature of a mortgage, but if the title is acquired through foreclosure of that mortgage or trust deed or by deed in lieu of foreclosure of that mortgage or trust deed, then the title to the property shall not revert, but shall be subject to the restrictions as to use, but not any penalty for nonuse, contained in this Act with respect to any mortgagee in possession or its successor or assigns.",
