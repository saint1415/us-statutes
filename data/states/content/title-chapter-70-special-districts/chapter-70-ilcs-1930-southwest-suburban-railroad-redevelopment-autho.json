The Southwest Suburban area, by reason of the\nlocation therein of vital roadways and their use for\nvehicular travel in access to the entire southwest metropolitan Chicago area,\nas well as commercial and industrial\ngrowth patterns and accessibility to\nmanufacturing and freight-related facilities, has become and will\nincreasingly be the hub of\ntransportation from all parts of the region and throughout the southwest\nmetropolitan area. Motor vehicle traffic, pedestrian travel, and the safety of\nboth motorists and pedestrians are substantially aggravated by the location of\nrailroad\ngrade crossings. Additionally, certain development opportunities may\nexist in the project area that would stabilize and enhance the tax base of\nexisting communities, maintain and revitalize existing commerce and industry,\nand\npromote comprehensive planning within and between communities. The presence of\nthe railroad grade crossings are\ndetrimental to the orderly expansion of industry and commerce and to progress\nof the region. To alleviate this situation it is necessary to relocate the\nrailroad tracks, to separate the grades at\ncrossing, to acquire property for relocation or submergence of the railroad\nor highways, to create an agency to facilitate and accomplish that\nrelocation, and to direct infrastructure and development improvements in the\nSouthwest Suburban area.",
