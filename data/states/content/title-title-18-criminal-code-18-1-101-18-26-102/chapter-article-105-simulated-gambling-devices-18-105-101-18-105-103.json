These machines, systems, and devices, as more fully described in this article, appear designed to evade the existing constitutional and statutory regulations on gambling activity in Colorado and therefore are declared to be contrary to the public policy of this state.(b)The gambling occurring at internet sweepstakes cafes has none of the protections that are afforded to players at legal gaming sites in Colorado. This absence of uniform regulation and ongoing, governmental oversight presents a danger to consumers throughout the state of Colorado. These sites comply with none of the regulatory requirements, such as surveillance and tracking of wagers and payouts, to assure consumers that gambling is being conducted fairly and honestly. The general assembly finds that these dangers are profound, putting at risk the financial resources of vulnerable persons and customers who are used to wagering based on clear regulatory standards and who have official lines of authority to which they may appeal when there are questionable or illegal practices used by a licensed gaming operator.(c)The proliferation of internet sweepstakes cafes presents an increasing risk to consumers, particularly as these sweepstakes cafes have spread to sites throughout the state and are capable of operating without facing adverse consequences for their illegal, unfair, or unregulated acts;(d)The diversion of consumer dollars to these untaxed gambling activities not only presents the opportunity for theft but also undermines state and local programs that are funded by revenue derived from legalized gambling, including parks and recreation, historic preservation, and the state's general fund;(e)There is no adequate local or federal regulation of internet sweepstakes cafes, and the ability of the owners of those facilities to operate in any community in the state or to move their operations from one part of the state to another without notifying any regulatory body makes this an issue of statewide concern, appropriate for action by the general assembly;(f)The voters of Colorado have carefully chosen the forms of gambling to which to give their approval and the conditions under which those forms of gambling may be conducted.
