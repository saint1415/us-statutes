Laws, c. 26,\n\n§\n\n 2;§\n\n8602. Conditions of payment.(a) When the court determines that a defendant must pay the costs of defense, the court may grant permission for payment to be made within a specified period of time or in specified installments. If no such permission is granted, the full amount shall be payable forthwith.(b) When the court determines that a defendant must pay the costs of defense and the defendant is also placed on probation, or the imposition or execution of a sentence is suspended, the court may make payment of such costs a condition of probation or suspension of sentence.61 Del. Laws, c. 160,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;§\n\n8603. Nonpayment of costs.(a) When a defendant who is required to pay the costs of defense defaults in the payment thereof or of any installment, the court on motion of the Attorney General or upon its own motion may require the defendant to show cause why the default should not be treated as contempt of court, and may issue a rule or order to show cause why such default should not be treated as contempt of court, and may take such further actions as the court determines to produce the defendant before the court.(b) If there has been no former citation for contempt, the term of imprisonment for contempt for the nonpayment of defense costs shall be set forth in the commitment order, and shall not exceed 1 day for each $25 of the full amount. In no event shall imprisonment exceed 30 days if the fine was imposed upon conviction of a violation or misdemeanor. In all other cases, the court may impose a term of imprisonment not to exceed 1 year. A person committed for nonpayment shall be given credit toward payment for each day of imprisonment at the rate specified in the commitment order.(c) Upon a second or subsequent citation for contempt and unless the defendant shows that the default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on the defendant’s part to make good faith effort to make the payment, the court may find that such default constitutes contempt and may order the defendant committed until the payment, or a specified part thereof, is paid.(d) If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the default in the payment of defense costs is not contempt, the court may enter an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount thereof or of each installment, or revoking such payment or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in part.(e) A default in the payment of defense costs or any installment thereof may be collected by any means authorized by law for the enforcement of a judgment. The levy of execution for the collection of such payment shall not discharge a defendant committed for imprisonment for contempt until the full amount of the fine has actually been collected. The court shall have the power to pursue civil enforcement to obtain the money due on behalf of the State, and to also pursue criminal remedies when civil means are not effective.61 Del. Laws, c. 160,\n\n§\n\n 1;70 Del. Laws, c. 186,\n\n§\n\n 1;",
