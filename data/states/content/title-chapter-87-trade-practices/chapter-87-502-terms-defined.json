If an alleged trade secret is ascertainable at all by any means that are not “improper,” the would-be secret is peremptorily excluded from coverage under Nebraska’s act. First Express Servs. Group v. Easter, 286 Neb. 912, 840 N.W.2d 465 (2013).Under this section, a recipe can be considered a trade secret. Magistro v. J. Lou, Inc., 270 Neb. 438, 703 N.W.2d 887 (2005).A customer list can be included in the definition of a trade secret under this section. Home Pride Foods v. Johnson, 262 Neb. 701, 634 N.W.2d 774 (2001).",
