It also divides the consolidated\nprovisions into smaller Sections for ease of use and future amendment and\nmakes technical corrections. This Act is intended as a continuation of the\nconsolidated provisions, and the consolidation is not intended to make any\nsubstantive change in the law nor to affect any order issued under any of the\nconsolidated provisions.",
