      "text": "The text of the Compact is set forth in this chapter.84 Del. Laws, c. 110,\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1702B. Purpose.(a) In order to strengthen access to medical services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating states of the PA Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline physician assistants and seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a physician assistant while safeguarding the safety of patients. This Compact allows medical services to be provided by physician assistants, via the mutual recognition of the licensee’s qualifying license by other compact participating states. This Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for physician assistant licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the physician assistant occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter, and therefore requires the physician assistant to be under the jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in this Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a physician assistant through the procedures of this Compact.(b) The PA Licensure Compact will alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.84 Del. Laws, c. 110,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1703B. Definitions.As used in this Compact:(1) “Adverse action” means any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted by a state’s laws which is imposed by a licensing board or other authority against a physician assistant license or license application or compact privilege such as license denial, censure, revocation, suspension, probation, monitoring of the licensee, or restriction on the licensee’s practice.(2) “Compact privilege” means the authorization granted by a remote state to allow a licensee from another participating state to practice as a physician assistant to provide medical services and other licensed activity to a patient located in the remote state under the remote state’s laws and regulations.(3) “Conviction” means a finding by a court that an individual is guilty of a felony or misdemeanor offense through adjudication or entry of a plea of guilt or no contest to the charge by the offender.(4) “Criminal background check” means the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information for a license applicant for the purpose of obtaining that applicant’s criminal history record information, as defined in 28 C.F.R. § 20.3(d), from the state’s criminal history record repository as defined in 28 C.F.R. § 20.3(f).(5) “Data system” means the repository of information about licensees, including but not limited to license status and adverse actions, which is created and administered under the terms of this Compact.(6) “Executive Committee” means a group of directors and ex officio individuals elected or appointed pursuant to § 1708B(f)(2) of this title.(7) “Impaired practitioner” means a physician assistant whose practice is adversely affected by health-related condition(s) that impact their ability to practice.(8) “Investigative information” means information, records, or documents received or generated by a licensing board pursuant to an investigation.(9) “Jurisprudence requirement” means the assessment of an individual’s knowledge of the laws and rules governing the practice of a physician assistant in a state.(10) “License” means current authorization by a state, other than authorization pursuant to a compact privilege, for a physician assistant to provide medical services, which would be unlawful without current authorization.(11) “Licensee” means an individual who holds a license from a state to provide medical services as a physician assistant.(12) “Licensing board” means any state entity authorized to license and otherwise regulate physician assistants.(13) “Medical services” means health care services provided for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, cure or relief of a health condition, injury, or disease, as defined by a state’s laws and regulations.(14) “Model Compact” means the model for the PA Licensure Compact on file with The Council of State Governments or other entity as designated by the Commission.(15) “Participating state” means a state that has enacted this Compact.(16) “PA” or “physician assistant” means an individual who is licensed as a physician assistant in a state.

A copy of the recording and the written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments received in response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a person upon request.(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.(j) Following the public hearing the Commission shall consider all written and oral comments timely received.(k) The Commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.(1) If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the Commission’s website.(2) The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.(3) The Commission shall provide on its website an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.(4) The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l) of this section, the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after the Commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.(l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours prior notice, without the opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately by the Commission in order to do 1 or more of the following:(1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare.(2) Prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds.(3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a commission rule that is established by federal law or rule.(4) Protect public health and safety.(m) The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Commission Rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.(n) No participating state’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this Compact.84 Del.

Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement.(a)Oversight: —(1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.(2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.(3) The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact or the Commission’s rules and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission with service of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding void as to the Commission, this Compact, or commission rules.(b)Default, technical assistance, and termination. —(1) If the Commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the commission rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any other action that the Commission may take and shall offer remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.(2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact upon such state may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.(3) Termination of participation in this Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and to the licensing board(s) of each of the participating states.(4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.(5) The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from this Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.(6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the Compact by the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.(7) Upon the termination of a state’s participation in the Compact, the state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination:a. Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days following the effective date of such termination.b. Licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state before the 180-day period ends, in which case the compact privilege shall continue.(c)Dispute resolution. —(1) Upon request by a participating state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to this Compact that arise among participating states and between participating and non-participating states.(2) The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.(d)Enforcement.—(1) The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and rules of the Commission.(2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices, against a participating state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this Compact and the Commission’s promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.(3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.(e)Legal action against the Commission.—(1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.(2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this Compact against the Commission.84 Del. Laws, c. 110,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1712B. Date of implementation of the PA Licensure Compact Commission.(a) This Compact shall come into effect on the date on which this Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.(1) On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that enacted the Compact prior to the Commission convening (“charter participating states”) to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially different from the Model Compact.a. A charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the Model Compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in § 1711B(b) of this title.b. If any participating state later withdraws from the Compact or its participation is terminated, the Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of participating states should be less than 7. Participating states enacting the Compact subsequent to the Commission convening shall be subject to the process set forth in § 1708B(c)(21) of this title to determine if their enactments are materially different from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.(2) Participating states enacting the Compact subsequent to the 7 initial charter participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in § 1708B(c)(21) of this title to determine if their enactments are materially different from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.(3) All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.(b) Any state that joins this Compact shall be subject to the Commission’s Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which this Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day this Compact becomes law in that state.(c) Any participating state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.(1) A participating state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute. During this 180-day period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state shall remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state within the 180 days, the licensee’s compact privileges in other participating states shall not be affected by the passage of the 180 days.(2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the state licensing board(s) of the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative, and adverse action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.(3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this Compact, the state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.(d) Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any physician assistant licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between participating states and between a participating state and non-participating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.(e) This Compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into the laws of all participating states as determined by the Commission.84 Del. Laws, c. 110,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1713B. Construction and severability.(a) This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.(b) The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the Commission may deny a state’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of § 1711B(b) of this title, terminate a participating state’s participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with respect to a state seeking to participate in the Compact, a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters.84 Del. Laws, c. 110,\n\n§\n\n1;§\n\n1714B. Binding effect of compact.(a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not inconsistent with this Compact.(b) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.(c) All agreements between the Commission and the participating states are binding in accordance with their terms.84 Del. Laws, c. 110,\n\n§\n\n1;84 Del. Laws, c. 110,\n\n§\n\n1;",
