This\nunavailability of reasonable credit restricts business growth and job\nopportunities and causes business failures resulting in unemployment and\nunderemployment with resulting persistent poverty in such urban areas.\nThe amelioration of these conditions is a responsibility of both the\npublic and private sector of our economy. Rehabilitation of the economic\nlife of blighted areas is necessary in order to prevent business\nfailures, to maintain the income of existing small business enterprises,\nto provide a business climate conducive to the growth of new small\nbusiness enterprises, and to broaden the tax base of such urban areas,\nall to afford more meaningful and rewarding business and job\nopportunities for the residents of such areas, thereby reducing the\nhazards of unemployment and raising the job opportunities of the\nunderemployed.",
