Unresolved disputes between the\neducational employees and their employers are injurious to the public, and\nthe General Assembly is therefore aware that adequate means must be established\nfor minimizing them and providing for their resolution.\nIt is the purpose of this Act to regulate labor relations between\neducational employers and educational employees, including the designation\nof educational employee representatives, negotiation of wages, hours and\nother conditions of employment and resolution of disputes arising under\ncollective bargaining agreements. The General Assembly recognizes that\nsubstantial differences exist between educational employees and other\npublic employees as a result of the uniqueness of the educational work\ncalendar and educational work duties and the traditional and historical\npatterns of collective bargaining between educational employers and\neducational employees and that such differences demand statutory regulation\nof collective bargaining between educational employers and educational\nemployees in a manner that recognizes these differences. Recognizing that\nharmonious relationships are required between educational employees and\ntheir employers, the General Assembly has determined that the overall policy\nmay best be accomplished by (a) granting to educational employees the right\nto organize and choose freely their representatives; (b) requiring educational\nemployers to negotiate and bargain with employee organizations representing\neducational employees and to enter into written agreements evidencing the\nresult of such bargaining; and (c) establishing procedures to provide for\nthe protection of the rights of the educational employee, the educational\nemployer and the public.",
