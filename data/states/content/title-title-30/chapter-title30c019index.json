If the entire business of the corporation is transacted or conducted within this State, the remainder of its entire net income shall be allocated to this State. If the business of the corporation is transacted or conducted in part without this State, such remainder, whether income or loss, shall be apportioned to this State:1. For taxable periods beginning before January 1, 2017, by multiplying such remainder by the arithmetical average of the 3 factors set forth in paragraphs (b)(6)b.1.,2., and 3. of this section;2. For taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2018, by multiplying such remainder by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.1. of this section plus the payroll factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.2. of this section plus double the sales factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.3. of this section, and the denominator of which is 4;3. For taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2019, by multiplying such remainder by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.1. of this section plus the payroll factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.2. of this section plus triple the sales factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.3. of this section, and the denominator of which is 5;4. For taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2018, and before January 1, 2020, by multiplying such remainder by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the property factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.1. of this section plus the payroll factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.2. of this section plus 6 times the sales factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.3. of this section, and the denominator of which is 8; and5. For taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2019, by multiplying such remainder by the sales factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.3. of this section.b. The factors shall be calculated as follows:1. The property factor shall equal the average of the value, at the beginning and end of the income year, of all the real and tangible personal property, owned or rented, in this State by the taxpayer, expressed as a percentage of the average of the value at the beginning and end of the income year of all such property of the taxpayer both within and without this State; provided, that any property, the income from which is separately allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or which is not used in the taxpayer’s business, shall be disregarded, and provided further, that in the case of a non-U.S. corporation, property without this State shall include only property located without this State, but also within the United States. For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)b.1., property owned by the taxpayer shall be valued at its original cost to the taxpayer, and property rented by the taxpayer shall be valued at 8 times the annual rental;2. The payroll factor shall equal the wages, salaries and other compensation paid by the taxpayer to employees within this State, except general executive officers, during the income year expressed as a percentage of all such wages, salaries and other compensation paid within and without this State during the income year to all employees of the taxpayer, except general executive officers; provided, that in the case of a non-U.S. corporation, wages, salaries and other compensation paid without this State during the income year shall include only wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the income year to employees of the taxpayer, except general executive officers, that are deductible under § 882 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. § 882), as amended, in determining federal taxable income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States;3. The sales factor shall equal the gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property physically delivered within this State to the purchaser or the purchaser’s agent (but not including delivery to the United States mail or to a common or contract carrier for shipment to a place outside this State) and gross income from other sources within this State for the income year expressed as a percentage of all such gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property and gross income from other sources both within and without the State for the income year; provided, that any receipts or items of income that are excluded in determining the taxpayer’s entire net income or are directly allocated under paragraphs (b)(1) to (5) of this section shall be disregarded.c. This paragraph (b)(6) shall not apply in the case of:1. An asset management corporation;2. A telecommunications corporation; or3. A worldwide headquarters corporation.(7) The remainder of the entire net income of an asset management corporation shall be apportioned to this State on the basis of the ratio of gross receipts from asset management services from sources within this State for the income year expressed as a percentage of all such gross receipts from asset management services both within and without the State for the income year; provided, that any receipts or items of income that are excluded in determining the taxpayer’s entire net income or are directly allocated under paragraphs (b)(1) to (5) of this section shall be disregarded. The source of gross receipts from asset management services shall be determined as follows:a. In the case of asset management services provided directly or indirectly to an individual, gross receipts with respect to such services shall be sourced to the State of the individual’s domicile.b. In the case of asset management services provided directly or indirectly to an institutional investor holding investments for the benefit of others, such as a pension plan, retirement account or pool of intangible investments, including a fund (other than an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.)), or to an institutional investor organized as a pass-through entity (as defined in § 1601(6)a. of this title), gross receipts with respect to such services shall be sourced according to the following rules in the following order:1. If information regarding domicile of beneficiaries, owners or members is available to the asset management corporation providing asset management services to a pension plan, retirement account or pool of intangible investments, including a fund (other than an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.)), or to an institutional investor organized as a pass-through entity (as defined in § 1601(6)a. of this title) through the exercise of reasonable diligence in ascertaining such information, gross receipts with respect to such services shall be sourced to the domicile of such beneficiaries, owners or members;2. If information regarding domicile of beneficiaries, owners or members is not available to the asset management corporation providing asset management services to a pension plan, retirement account or pool of intangible investments, including a fund (other than an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.)), or to an institutional investor organized as a pass-through entity (as defined in § 1601(6)a. of this title) through the exercise of reasonable diligence in ascertaining such information, a reasonable alternative method based on information readily available to the asset management corporation may be used to determine the source of gross receipts with respect to such services, and such reasonable alternative method shall be disclosed and explained in the return in which the method is used. The burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of the method rests on the taxpayer. Based on facts and circumstances in specific cases, reasonable alternative methods used to determine the source of gross receipts from asset management services may take into account the latest population census data available from the United States Census Bureau, the domicile of the sponsor of a pension plan or retirement account or an account or pool of intangible investments (other than an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.)) or the domicile of an institutional investor organized as a pass-through entity (as defined in § 1601(6)a. of this title); or,3. IfA. The domicile of beneficiaries, owners or members is not ascertained under paragraph (b)(7)b.1. of this section; or,B. No reasonable alternative sourcing method exists under paragraph (b)(7)b.2. of this section, gross receipts with respect to such services shall be sourced to the domicile of the institutional investor or the domicile of the sponsor of a pension plan or retirement account or an account or pool of intangible investments, including a fund (other than an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.)), to which asset management services are provided.c. In the case of asset management services provided directly or indirectly to an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.), gross receipts with respect to such services shall be sourced to the domicile of the shareholders of such investment company in accordance with the following procedure: the portion of the gross receipts with respect to such services that are sourced to this State shall be determined by multiplying the total of such gross receipts by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average of the sum of the beginning of year and the end of year balance of shares owned by the investment company shareholders domiciled in this State for the investment company’s taxable year for federal income tax purposes and the denominator of which is the average of the sum of the beginning of year and the end of year balance of shares owned by all investment company shareholders. A separate computation shall be made with respect to gross receipts for asset management services provided directly or indirectly to each investment company.d. In the case of asset management services provided directly or indirectly to a person other than those persons described in paragraph (b)(7)a. through c. of this section, to the domicile of such person.(8) If the entire business of a telecommunications corporation or a worldwide headquarters corporation is transacted or conducted within this State, the remainder of its entire net income shall be allocated to this State. If the business of a telecommunications corporation or a worldwide headquarters corporation is transacted or conducted in part without this State, such remainder, whether income or loss, shall be apportioned to this State:a. For taxable periods beginning before January 1, 2017, by multiplying such remainder by the arithmetical average of the 3 factors set forth in paragraphs (b)(6)b.1., 2., and 3.of this section; andb. For taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2016, by electing, on an annual basis, either to:1. Multiply such remainder by the sales factor set forth in paragraph (b)(6)b.3. of this section; or2. Multiply such remainder by the arithmetical average of the 3 factors set forth in paragraphs (b)(6)b.1., 2., and 3. of this section.(c) If, in the discretion of the Secretary of Finance, the application of the allocation or apportionment provisions of this section result in an unfair or inequitable proportion of the taxpayer’s entire net income being assigned to this State, then the Secretary of Finance or the Secretary’s delegate may permit or require the exclusion or alteration of the weight to be given to 1 or more of the factors in the formula specified above or the use of separate accounting or other method to produce a fair and equitable result.(d) To determine entire net income for any income year under this chapter, an amount is added to or subtracted from the amount of federal taxable income for such year as computed for purposes of the federal income tax:(1) For domestic research and experimental expenditures made after December 31, 2021, but on or before December 31, 2024, to continue the expensing of such expenditures under the United States Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.] provisions in effect immediately before the enactment of § 70302 of P.L. 119-21, rather than under § 70302 of P.L. 119-21.(2) For property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2031, which would otherwise be eligible for expensing under § 70301 of P.L. 119-21, to continue the amortization and depreciation of such property under the United States Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.] provisions in effect immediately before the enactment of § 70301 of P.L. 119-21, rather than under § 70301 of P.L. 119-21.(3) For qualified production property, as defined in § 70307 of P.L. 119-21, placed in service before January 1, 2031, to continue the amortization and depreciation of such property under the United States Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.] provisions in effect immediately before the enactment of § 70307 of P.L. 119-21, rather than under § 70307 of P.L. 119-21.30 Del.
