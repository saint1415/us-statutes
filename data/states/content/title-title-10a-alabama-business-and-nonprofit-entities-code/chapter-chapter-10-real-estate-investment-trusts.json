Unless the articles of merger provide otherwise, by a majority vote of the entire board of trustees of each Alabama real estate investment trust party to the articles.\n\nc. By unanimous consent of the members of a limited liability company party to the articles of merger.\n\nd. By unanimous consent of the partners of a limited partnership party to the articles of merger.\n\n(2) If the articles of merger have been filed in the Office of the Secretary of State, notice of the abandonment shall be given promptly to the Secretary of State.\n\n(3)a. If the proposed merger is abandoned as provided in this subsection, no legal liability arises under the articles of merger.\n\nb. An abandonment does not prejudice the rights of any person under any other contract made by a business trust, corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company party to the proposed articles of merger in connection with the proposed merger.\n\nc. Each shareholder of an Alabama real estate investment trust objecting to a merger of the Alabama real estate investment trust shall have the same rights as a stockholder of an Alabama corporation under Article 13 of Chapter 2A and under the same procedures.\n\n(i) The Secretary of State shall prepare certificates of merger that specify:\n\n(1) The name of each party to the articles of merger.\n\n(2) The name of the successor and the location of its principal office in this state or, if it has none, its principal place of business.\n\n(3) The time the articles of merger are accepted for record by the Secretary of State.\n\n(j) If the successor in a merger is an Alabama real estate investment trust, a merger is effective as of the later of:\n\n(1) The time the Secretary of State accepts the articles of merger for record.\n\n(2) The time established under the articles of merger, not to exceed 30 days after the articles are accepted for record.\n\n(k)(1) If the successor in a merger is a foreign corporation, a foreign limited partnership, a foreign limited liability company, or an Alabama or foreign business trust, other than an Alabama real estate investment trust, the merger is effective as of the later of:\n\na. The time specified by the law of the place where the successor is organized.\n\nb. The time the Secretary of State accepts the articles of merger for record.\n\n(2) A foreign successor in a merger may deliver for filing to the Secretary of State a certificate which certifies the date the articles of merger were filed. However, the failure to file this certificate does not invalidate the merger.\n\n(l)(1) Consummation of a merger has the effects provided in this subsection.\n\n(2) The separate existence of each business trust, corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company party to the articles of merger, except the successor, ceases.\n\n(3) The shares of each business trust party to the articles of merger which are to be converted or exchanged under the terms of the articles cease to exist, subject to the rights of an objecting shareholder under this section.\n\n(4) In addition to any other purposes and powers set forth in the articles, if the articles of merger provide, the successor has the purposes and powers of each party to the articles.\n\n(5)a. The assets of each party to the articles of merger, including any legacies which it would have been capable of taking, vest in and devolve on the successor without further act or deed.\n\nb. Confirmatory deeds, assignments, or similar instruments to evidence the merger may be executed and delivered at any time in the name of either party to the articles of merger. A certified copy of any document required to be filed under this section may be filed in the real estate records in the office of the judge of probate in any county in which the nonsuccessor party owned real property, without payment and without collection by the judge of probate of any deed or other transfer tax or fee. The judge of probate, however, may collect a filing fee of five dollars ($5). Any such filing shall evidence chain of title, but lack of filing shall not affect the converted entity’s title to the real property.\n\n(6)a. The successor is liable for all the debts and obligations of each nonsurviving party to the articles of merger. An existing claim, action, or proceeding pending by or against any nonsurviving party to the articles of merger may be prosecuted to judgment as if the merger had not taken place, or, on motion of the successor or any party, the successor may be substituted as a party and the judgment against the nonsurviving party to the articles of merger constitutes a lien on the property of the successor.\n\nb. A merger does not impair the rights of creditors or any liens on the property of any business trust, corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company which is a party to the articles of merger.\n\n(m) This section is not exclusive. Real estate investment trusts may merge or exchange their shares in any other manner provided by law, including pursuant to the provisions of Article 8 of Chapter 1.\n\n(Acts 1995, No. 95-628, p. 1317, §15; §10-13-15; amended and renumbered by Act 2009-513, p. 967, §308; Act 2019-94, §2; Act 2020-73, §10.)",
