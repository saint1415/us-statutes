In any dispute concerning the reasonableness of a restriction under this subsection, the Alabama statewide trade association has the burden of proving reasonableness.\n\n(d) This section does not limit the power of a court, upon showing of good cause, to compel the production of the books and records of an Alabama statewide trade association, including records not set forth in Section 10A-18-1.04, to the court for examination by a court appointed professional and to impose reasonable restrictions on the use of those books and records by that court appointed professional.\n\n(Act 2024-413, §3.)",
