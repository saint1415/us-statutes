During these time delays, communities may not be financially capable of replacing\nsupplies, leaving the community unprotected in case of other incidents.\nTherefore; it is the intent of the General Assembly to establish the\nHazardous Material Emergency Reimbursement Fund to alleviate the financial\nhardships imposed upon any community that responds to\nemergency incidents\ninvolving hazardous materials.",
