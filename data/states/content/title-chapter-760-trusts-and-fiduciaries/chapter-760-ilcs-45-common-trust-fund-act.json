The plan may provide that if a\nbond or other obligation for the payment of money is acquired as an investment\nfor any common trust fund at a cost in excess of the par or maturity value\nthereof, such excess cost need not be amortized out of income within the\ncommon trust fund itself; if the plan, however, should provide for the amortization\nof such excess cost out of the income of such obligation, then such amortization\nshall be made during but not beyond the period that such obligation is held\nas an investment in such fund by deducting from each receipt of income and\nadding to principal an amount equal to the sum obtained by dividing such\nexcess cost by the number of periodic payments of income to accrue on such\nobligation from the date of such acquisition until its maturity date.
