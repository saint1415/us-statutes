      "text": "Section 25-13-1\n\n(a) The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the safety of life and limb and to promote public safety awareness. The use of unsafe and defective lifting devices imposes a substantial probability of serious and preventable injury to employees and the public exposed to unsafe conditions. The prevention of these injuries and protection of employees and the public from unsafe conditions is in the best interest of the people of this state. Elevator personnel performing work covered by this chapter shall by documented training or experience, or both, be familiar with the operation and safety functions of the components and equipment. Training and experience shall include, but not be limited to, recognizing the safety hazards and performing the procedures to which they are assigned in conformance with the requirements of this chapter. This chapter shall establish the minimum standards for elevator personnel.\n\n(b) The provisions of this chapter are not intended to prevent the use of systems, methods, or devices of equivalent or superior quality, strength, fire resistance, code effectiveness, durability, and safety to those required by this chapter, provided that there is technical documentation to demonstrate the equivalency of the system, method, or device, as prescribed in ASME A17.1, ASME A18.1, or ASCE 21.\n\n(c) The design or modification of equipment covered by this chapter shall be prepared by or under the direct control and personal supervision of a licensed professional engineer.\n\n(Act 2003-349, p. 903, §1.)",

The license shall be renewable as long as the shortage of license holders shall continue.\n\n(d)(1) The renewal of all licenses granted under this section shall be conditioned upon the submission of a certificate of completion of a course designed to ensure the continuing education of licensees on new and existing provisions of the regulations of the board. The course shall consist of not less than eight hours of instruction and shall be attended and completed within one year immediately preceding any such license renewal.\n\n(2) The course shall be taught by instructors through continuing education providers and may include, but not be limited to, association seminars and labor training programs.
