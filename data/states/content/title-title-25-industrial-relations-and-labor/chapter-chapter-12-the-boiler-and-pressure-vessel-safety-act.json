The filing of reports of external inspections, other than certificate inspections, shall not be required except when the inspections disclose that the boiler or pressure vessel is in a dangerous condition.\n\n(b) Each company operating pressure vessels covered by an owner or user inspection service meeting the requirements of subsection (a) of Section 25-12-10 shall maintain in its files an inspection record which shall list, by number and any abbreviated description necessary for identification, each pressure vessel covered by this chapter, the date of the last inspection of each pressure vessel, and the approximate date for the next inspection. The inspection record shall be available for examination by the chief inspector or his or her authorized representative during business hours.\n\n(c) If the report filed pursuant to subsection (a) shows that a boiler or pressure vessel is found to comply with the rules and regulations of the department, the chief inspector, or his or her duly authorized representative, shall issue to the owner or user an inspection certificate bearing the date of inspection and specifying the maximum pressure under which the boiler or pressure vessel may be operated. The inspection certificate shall be valid for not more than 14 months from its date in the case of power boilers, 26 months in the case of heating and hot water supply boilers, and 38 months in the case of pressure vessels. In the case of those boilers and pressure vessels covered by paragraphs a. to d., inclusive, of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of Section 25-12-14, for which the board has established or extended the operating period between required inspections pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs c. and d. of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of Section 25-12-14, the certificate shall be valid for a period of not more than two months beyond the period set by the board. Certificates for boilers shall be posted under glass, or similarly protected, in the room containing the boiler. Pressure vessel certificates shall be posted in like manner, if convenient, or filed where they will be readily accessible for examination.\n\n(d) No inspection certificate issued for an insured boiler or pressure vessel based upon a report of a special inspector shall be valid after the boiler or pressure vessel for which it was issued shall cease to be insured by a company duly authorized by this state to provide the insurance.\n\n(e) The secretary or his or her authorized representative may at any time suspend an inspection certificate after showing cause that the boiler or pressure vessel for which it was issued cannot be operated without menace to the public safety or when the boiler or pressure vessel is found not to comply with the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter. Each suspension of an inspection certificate shall continue in effect until the boiler or pressure vessel shall conform to the rules and regulations of the department and until the reinstatement of the inspection certificate.\n\n(f) The secretary or his or her authorized representative may issue a written order for the temporary cessation of operation of a boiler or pressure vessel if it has been determined after inspection to be hazardous or unsafe. Operations shall not resume until the conditions are corrected to the satisfaction of the secretary or his or her authorized representative.\n\n(Act 2000-315, p. 488, §15.)",

Inspections not performed within this 60 calendar day period shall result in a fine of five hundred dollars ($500) for each boiler or pressure vessel not inspected.\n\n(b)(1) Inspection fees due on boiler and pressure vessels subject to inspection by the chief or deputy inspectors or operating certificate fees due from inspections performed by special inspectors, or owner or user inspectors, shall be paid within 60 calendar days of completion of the inspections.\n\n(2) Inspection fees or operating certificate fees unpaid within 60 calendar days shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5 percent per month or any fraction of a month.
