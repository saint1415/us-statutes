An appeal by the defendant from such finding shall operate to supersede the same if at the time of taking said appeal the party taking the same shall file with the notice of appeal a bond in such sum as the board of appeals or judge of the circuit court, as the case may be, may prescribe, with sufficient surety to be approved by the clerk of said board or court, as the case may be, payable to the Secretary of Labor with conditions that the party appealing will prosecute said appeal to effect and if he fail therein will pay all damage which any person may sustain on account of any injury which may be proximately caused by the dangerous condition of the machine, tool, equipment, or structure affected by such finding.

Any such credit union shall endeavor to assist all such unemployed members by granting them extended periods within which to pay indebtedness owed to the credit union, to the extent deemed advisable by its board of directors.\n\n(d) In order to stabilize the share and deposit base of credit unions which may or could be affected by plant or industry closings or by substantial layoffs, any credit union which includes in its field of membership employees of any particular company or companies shall be authorized to accept shares and deposits from such company or companies, subject to such terms and conditions as the board of directors of the credit union may establish, and such company or companies may become a member of the credit union, subject to such terms and conditions as the board of directors of the credit union may establish.\n\n(e) The Secretary of Labor is further directed and authorized to issue rules, to the extent he or she deems advisable, concerning the instances in which employees at plants or industries which have been closed or have been the subject of substantial layoffs and organizations which include employees of such plants or industries may make appropriate disclosures of the financial situation of such employees and may assist the creditors of such workers in locating them and in arranging voluntary payment plans for their debts; provided however that nothing contained in this section shall be construed so as to authorize any activity which violates any federal act or regulation.\n\n(Act 2012-496, p. 1452, §3.)",
