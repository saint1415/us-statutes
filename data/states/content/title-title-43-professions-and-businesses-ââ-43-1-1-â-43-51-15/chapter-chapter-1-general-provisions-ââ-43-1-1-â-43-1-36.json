As used in this subsection, the term \"lacked substantial justification\" means substantially frivolous, substantially groundless, or substantially vexatious.(g)In its discretion, a professional licensing board may reinstate a license which has been revoked or issue a license which has been denied or refused, following such procedures as the board may prescribe by rule; and, as a condition thereof, it may impose any disciplinary or corrective method provided in this Code section or the laws relating to the licensed business or profession.(h)(1)The division director is vested with the power and authority to make, or cause to be made through employees or agents of the division, such investigations as he or she or a respective board may deem necessary or proper for the enforcement of the provisions of this Code section and the laws relating to businesses and professions licensed by that board. Any person properly conducting an investigation on behalf of a professional licensing board shall have access to and may examine any writing, document, or other material relating to the fitness of any licensee or applicant.

Any person who testifies or who makes a recommendation to a professional licensing board in the nature of peer review, in good faith, without fraud or malice, before the board in any proceeding involving the provisions of subsection (a) of this Code section or any other law relating to a licensee's or applicant's fitness to practice the business or profession licensed by the board shall be immune from civil and criminal liability for so testifying.(j)Neither the issuance of a private reprimand nor the denial of a license by reciprocity nor the denial of a request for reinstatement of a revoked license nor the refusal to issue a previously denied license shall be considered to be a contested case within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 50, the \"Georgia Administrative Procedure Act\"; notice and hearing within the meaning of such chapter shall not be required, but the applicant or licensee shall be allowed to appear before the board if he or she so requests. A board may resolve a pending action by the issuance of a letter of concern. Such letter shall not be considered a disciplinary action or a contested case under Chapter 13 of Title 50 and shall not be disclosed to any person except the licensee or applicant.(k)If any licensee or applicant after reasonable notice fails to appear at any hearing of the professional licensing board for that licensee or applicant, the board may proceed to hear the evidence against such licensee or applicant and take action as if such licensee or applicant had been present.

If such material is served by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery and is returned marked \"unclaimed\" or \"refused\" or is otherwise undeliverable and if the licensee or applicant cannot, after diligent effort, be located, the division director, or his or her designee, shall be deemed to be the agent for service for such licensee or applicant for purposes of this Code section, and service upon that director, or that director's designee, shall be deemed to be service upon the licensee or applicant.(l)The voluntary surrender of a license or the failure to renew a license by the end of an established penalty period shall have the same effect as a revocation of such license, subject to reinstatement in the discretion of a board. A board may restore and reissue a license to practice under the law relating to that board and, as a condition thereof, may impose any disciplinary sanction provided by this Code section or the law relating to that board.(m)This Code section shall apply equally to all licensees or applicants whether individuals, partners, or members of any other incorporated or unincorporated associations, corporations, limited liability companies, or other associations of any kind whatsoever.(n)Regulation by a professional licensing board of a business or profession licensed under this title shall not exempt that business or profession from regulation pursuant to any other applicable law, including but not limited to Part 2 of Article 15 of Chapter 1 of Title 10, the \"Fair Business Practices Act of 1975.\"(o)Subsections (a), (d), and (e) of this Code section shall be supplemental to and shall not operate to prohibit any professional licensing board from acting pursuant to those provisions of law which may now or hereafter authorize other disciplinary grounds and actions for that particular board. In cases where those other provisions of law so authorize other disciplinary grounds and actions but subsection (a), (d), or (e) of this Code section limits such grounds or actions, those other provisions shall apply so long as the requirements of subsection (q) of this Code section are met.(p)(1)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code section or title, when an applicant submits his or her application for licensure or renewal, together with proof of completion of a drug court division as set forth in Code Section15-1-15, a mental health court division as set forth in Code Section15-1-16, a veterans court division as set forth in Code Section15-1-17, an operating under the influence court division as set forth in Code Section15-1-19, or a family treatment court division as set forth in Code Section15-11-70, a board shall issue the applicant a probationary license under the terms and conditions deemed appropriate by such board.(2)Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not supersede a board's consideration of an applicant's other prior criminal history or arrests or convictions that occur subsequent to completion of a court division identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection.(q)(1)Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of this Code section or any other provision of law, and unless a felony or crime involving moral turpitude directly relates to the occupation for which the license is sought or held, no professional licensing board shall refuse to grant a license to an applicant therefor or shall revoke the license of an individual licensed by that board due solely or in part to such applicant's or licensee's:(A)Conviction of any felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, whether it occurred in the courts of this state or any other state, territory, or country or in the courts of the United States;(B)Arrest, charge, and sentence for the commission of such offense;(C)Sentence for such offense pursuant to Article 3 of Chapter 8 of Title 42 or another state's first offender laws;(D)Sentence for such offense pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) of Code Section16-13-2;(E)Sentence for such offense as a result of a plea of nolo contendere;(F)Adjudication of guilt or sentence was otherwise withheld or not entered; or(G)Being under supervision by a community supervision officer, as such term is defined in Code Section42-3-1, for a conviction of any felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, whether it occurred in the courts of this state or any other state, territory, or country or in the courts of the United States, so long as such individual was not convicted of a felony violation of Chapter 5 of Title 16 nor convicted of a crime requiring registration on the state sexual offender registry.(2)In determining if a felony or crime involving moral turpitude directly relates to the occupation for which the license is sought or held, the professional licensing board shall consider:(A)The nature and seriousness of such felony or crime involving moral turpitude and the relationship of such felony or crime involving moral turpitude to the occupation for which the license is sought or held;(B)The age of the individual at the time such felony or crime involving moral turpitude was committed;(C)The length of time elapsed since such felony or crime involving moral turpitude was committed;(D)All circumstances relative to such felony or crime involving moral turpitude, including, but not limited to, mitigating circumstances or social conditions surrounding the commission of such felony or crime involving moral turpitude; and(E)Evidence of rehabilitation and present fitness to perform the duties of the occupation for which the license is sought or held.Amended by 2021 Ga.
