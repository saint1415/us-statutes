In addition, if such qualifying agent is the only qualifying agent licensed hereunder affiliated with the business organization, the business organization shall promptly notify the appropriate division of the termination of the relationship with that qualifying agent and shall have 180 days from the termination of the qualifying agent's affiliation with the business organization to employ another qualifying agent and submit an application for licensure under the new qualifying agent. The submission of such application shall serve to maintain the licensed status of the business organization pending and subject to approval of such application by the appropriate division; provided that, should such application be denied by that division, then, after the later of the passage of the 180 day period or the denial of the application, the business organization shall cease to be considered licensed as a residential or a commercial general contractor unless and until a new application is submitted and approved by the appropriate division. In such circumstance, the affected business organization may not thereafter engage in residential or commercial general contracting until a new qualifying agent is employed; provided, however, that, the appropriate division shall grant a temporary nonrenewable license to the financially responsible officer, the president or chief executive officer, a partner, or, in the case of a limited partnership, the general partner, who thereafter shall assume all responsibilities of a qualifying agent for the business organization or entity. This temporary license shall only allow the entity to proceed with incomplete contracts already in progress. For the purposes of this paragraph, an incomplete contract is one which has been awarded to, or entered into by, the business organization prior to the cessation of the business organization being considered licensed as a residential or a commercial general contractor or one on which the business organization was the low bidder and the contract is subsequently awarded, regardless of whether any actual work has commenced under the contract prior to the business organization ceasing to be considered licensed as a residential or a commercial general contractor.(2)A person licensed under this chapter either as an individual doing business in his or her name or doing business in a trade name as a sole proprietor may serve as a qualifying agent for a business organization upon application and demonstration of satisfaction by such business organization of all financial and insurance requirements pursuant to Code Section43-41-6. A qualifying agent may serve in such capacity for more than one business organization, provided that he or she shall satisfy the criteria for serving in such capacity with regard to each such business organization. A qualifying agent shall inform the division having jurisdiction in writing when he or she proposes to engage in contracting in his or her own name or in affiliation as a qualifying agent with another business organization, and he or she or such new business organization shall supply the same information to the division as required of applicants under this chapter. Such person shall be deemed to be a licensed residential or commercial general contractor for the original term of his or her license for the purpose of engaging in contracting as an individual in his or her own name, provided that he or she qualified for such license based on his or her own personal qualifications as to financial responsibility and insurance. Otherwise, such individual shall be required to submit a new application demonstrating satisfaction of such financial and insurance requirements in order to engage in the business of contracting under this chapter as an individual in his or her own name or doing business as an individual in a trade name as a sole proprietor or by the business organization he or she desires to qualify in order to obtain a license for such other business organization, but such person shall be entitled to continue engaging in the business of residential or commercial general contracting in accordance with and under his or her previously issued license unless and until the appropriate division determines that the person seeking issuance of the license no longer meets these requirements.(3)Upon a favorable determination by the division having jurisdiction, after investigation of the financial responsibility, if applicable, and insurance of the applicant, the division shall notify the applicant, whether the applicant was previously approved as an individual or a qualifying agent, that the applicant is approved, without an examination, for a new license.(f)Disciplinary action and other sanctions provided in this chapter may be administered against a business organization operating under a license issued through its licensed qualifying agent or agents in the same manner and on the same grounds as disciplinary actions or sanctions against an individual or license holder acting as its qualifying agent under this chapter. The divisions or the board may deny the license to a qualifying agent for any business organization if the qualifying agent or business organization has been involved in past disciplinary actions or on any grounds for which individual licenses can be denied.(g)Each qualifying agent shall pay the appropriate division an amount equal to the original fee for a license applied for on behalf of a new business organization. If the qualifying agent for a business organization desires to qualify additional business organizations, the division shall require him or her to present evidence of the financial responsibility, if applicable, and insurance of each such organization.(h)All qualifying agents for a business organization are jointly and equally responsible for supervision of all construction related operations of the business organization, for all field work at all sites, and for financial matters within the State of Georgia for each construction job for which his or her license was used to obtain the building permit.(i)Any change in the status of a qualifying agent is prospective only. A qualifying agent shall for purposes of application of this chapter and the enforcement and disciplinary mechanisms thereunder be and remain responsible for his or her actions or omissions as well as those of the business organization for which such person had acted as a qualifying agent occurring during his or her period of service as such qualifying agent as and to the extent set forth in this chapter. A qualifying agent is not responsible for his or her predecessor's actions, but is responsible, even after a change in status, for matters for which he or she was responsible while in a particular status. Further, nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as a basis for imposition of civil liability against an individual qualifying agent by any owner or other third party claimant beyond the liability that would otherwise exist legally or contractually apart from and independent of the individual's status as a qualifying agent.Amended by 2024 Ga.

Where an applicant under this chapter is seeking issuance of a residential or commercial general contractor license on behalf and for the benefit of a business organization seeking to engage in residential or commercial general contracting as a business organization, the application for a license under this chapter must be submitted by and through an individual qualifying agent for such business organization or entity and expressly on behalf of such business organization or entity. In such case, the license shall be issued to the individual qualifying agent and to the affiliated business organization or entity on whose behalf the application was made. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, or association to operate a business organization or entity engaged in the business of residential or commercial general contracting without first obtaining a license from the appropriate division. The appropriate division shall not issue a license to any business organization or entity to engage in residential or commercial general contracting unless such business organization or entity employs at least one currently licensed individual residential or commercial general contractor serving as its qualifying agent who is actually engaged by ownership or employment in the practice of residential or commercial general contracting for such business organization or entity and provides adequate supervision and is responsible for the projects of such business organization or entity. A business organization may allow more than one person to act as a qualifying agent for such organization, subject to each such individual qualifying agent having successfully satisfied the requirements for issuance of a license under this chapter and having obtained issuance of such a license by the appropriate division. Each such business organization shall have at least one qualifying agent in order to be considered authorized to engage in such contracting business.(b)The application for a license by a qualifying agent must include an affidavit on a form provided by the board attesting that the individual applicant has final approval authority for all construction work performed by the business organization or entity within the State of Georgia and that the individual applicant has final approval authority on all construction matters, including contracts and contract performance and financial affairs related to such construction matters, for each construction job for which his or her license was used to obtain the building permit.(c)A joint venture is considered a separate and distinct organization for licensing purposes under this chapter and must be qualified and licensed in accordance with the appropriate division's rules and regulations either:(1)In its own name as a separate business organization; or(2)By each of the members of the joint venture doing business as a residential contractor or commercial general contractor holding, as an individual or as a business organization acting through its qualifying agent, a valid and current residential or commercial general contractor's license issued by the appropriate division. Each such licensed individual or qualifying agent shall be considered a qualifying agent of such joint venture.(d)If, during the period encompassed by a license issued to a qualifying agent acting for and on behalf of an affiliated business organization, there is a change in any information that is required to be stated on the application, the business organization shall, within 45 days after such change occurs, furnish the correct information to the appropriate division.(e)(1)At least one qualifying agent shall be licensed under this chapter in order for the business organization to obtain a license as a residential or commercial general contractor.

Such person shall notify the appropriate division of the board within 30 days after the death of such contractor of such death and of his or her name and address, knowledge of the contract, and ability technically and financially to complete it. Such person may continue with performance of the contract pending approval by the division. If the division approves, he or she may proceed with the contract to completion.

For purposes of this subsection, a contractor shall be considered unlicensed only if the contractor was unlicensed on the effective date of the original contract for the work, if stated therein, or, if not stated, the date the last party to the contract executed such contract, if stated therein. If the contract does not establish such a date, the contractor shall be considered unlicensed only if the contractor was unlicensed on the first date upon which the contractor provided labor, services, or materials under the contract. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if a contract is rendered unenforceable under this subsection, no lien or bond claim shall exist in favor of the unlicensed contractor for any labor, services, or materials provided under the contract or any amendment thereto. This subsection shall not affect the rights of parties other than the unlicensed contractor to enforce contract, lien, or bond remedies. This subsection shall not affect the obligations of a surety that has provided a bond on behalf of an unlicensed contractor. It shall not be a defense to any claim on a bond or indemnity agreement that the principal or indemnitor is unlicensed for purposes of this subsection.(c)Any person who holds a license issued under this chapter may engage in the business of residential or commercial general contracting, but only as prescribed by the license, throughout the state and no municipality or county may require any such person licensed under this chapter to comply with any additional licensing requirements imposed by such municipality or county relative to the performance of construction work subject to the licensing requirements under this chapter.

The commercial general contractor division of the board, in agreement with the Department of Transportation, shall, by rule, define \"services incidental thereto\" for the purposes of this subsection only and shall likewise define any other necessary terms as to the scope of the exemption provided by this subsection.(e)Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any person holding a valid license issued by the State Construction Industry Licensing Board, or any division thereof, pursuant to Chapter 14 of this title from performing any work defined in the Code sections under which the license held by said person was issued. Furthermore, nothing in this chapter shall preclude a person licensed under Chapter 14 of this title to perform plumbing, conditioned air contracting, utility contracting, electrical contracting, or low-voltage contracting from offering to perform, performing, engaging in, or contracting to engage in the performance of construction work or services directly with an owner, which work would otherwise require a license under this chapter, where the total scope of the work to be performed is predominantly of the type for which such contractor is duly licensed to perform under Chapter 14 of this title such that any other work involved is incidental to and an integral part of the work performed within the scope of such license under said chapter and does not exceed the greater of $10,000.00 or 25 percent of the total value at the time of contracting of the work to be performed; provided, however, that such contractor may not delegate or assign the responsibility to directly supervise and manage the performance of such other work to a person unless such person is licensed under this chapter and the work being performed by such person is within the scope of that person's license.(f)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude a specialty contractor from offering or contracting to perform or undertaking or performing for an owner limited, specialty, or specific trade contractor work. However, nothing in this chapter shall permit a specialty contractor to perform work falling within the licensing requirements of Chapter 14 of this title where such specialty contractor is not duly licensed under such chapter to perform such work. The board shall, by rule or policy, identify specialty contractors or other criteria to determine eligibility under the exemption of this subsection. The specialty contractor otherwise exempted from license requirements under this chapter may perform work for an owner that would otherwise require a license under this chapter where the total scope of the work to be performed is predominantly of the type for which such specialty contractor is duly recognized as exempt under this subsection by the board, provided that such other work involved is incidental to and an integral part of the exempt work performed by the specialty contractor and does not exceed the greater of $10,000.00 or 25 percent of the total value at the time of contracting of the work to be performed.(g)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude a person from offering or contracting to perform or undertaking or performing for an owner repair work, provided that the person performing the repair work discloses to the owner that such person does not hold a license under this chapter and provided, further, that such work does not affect the structural integrity of the real property. The board shall by rule or regulation further define the term \"repair\" as used in this subsection and any other necessary terms as to the scope of this exemption.(h)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude any person from constructing a building or structure on real property owned by such person which is intended upon completion for use or occupancy solely by that person and his or her family, firm, or corporation and its employees, and not for use by the general public and not offered for sale or lease. In so doing, such person may act as his or her own contractor personally providing direct supervision and management of all work not performed by licensed contractors. However, if, under this subsection, the person or his or her family, firm, or corporation has previously sold or transferred a building or structure which had been constructed by such person acting without a licensed residential or commercial general contractor within the prior 24 month period, starting from the date on which a certificate of occupancy was issued for such building or structure, then such person may not, under this subsection, construct another separate building or structure without having first obtained on his or her own behalf an appropriate residential or commercial general contractor license or having engaged such a duly licensed contractor to perform such work to the extent required under this chapter, or it shall be presumed that the person, firm, or corporation did not intend such building solely for occupancy by that person and his or her family, firm, or corporation. Further, such person may not delegate the responsibility to directly supervise and manage all or any part of the work relating thereto to any other person unless that person is licensed under this chapter and the work being performed is within the scope of that person's license. In any event, however, all such work must be done in conformity with all other applicable provisions of this title, the rules and regulations of the board and division involved, and any applicable county or municipal resolutions, ordinances, codes, permitting, or inspection requirements.(i)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude an architect licensed pursuant to Chapter 4 of this title, an interior designer registered pursuant to Chapter 4 of this title, or an engineer registered pursuant to Chapter 15 of this title from performing work or providing services within the scope of his or her registration for the practice of architecture or interior design or license for practicing engineering.(j)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude an architect licensed pursuant to Chapter 4 of this title, an interior designer registered pursuant to Chapter 4 of this title, or an engineer registered pursuant to Chapter 15 of this title from offering to perform or offering or rendering design-build services to an owner; provided, however, that such offer or contract shall clearly indicate at the time of such offer or contract that all services of a commercial general contractor incident to the design-build performance shall be performed by a duly licensed commercial general contractor in compliance with other provisions of this chapter and that all services so offered or provided falling within the scope of the licensing requirements of this chapter are offered and rendered by a licensed commercial general contractor in accordance with this chapter.(k)Nothing in this chapter shall apply to the construction, alteration, or repair of buildings classified as an agricultural occupancy or that are used for agricultural storage or agricultural purposes.(l)A contractor licensed under this chapter shall not be required to list on the face of a bid or proposal envelope the license number of any contractor licensed under Chapter 14 of this title that may or will be engaged to perform any work within the licensing requirements of Chapter 14 of this title which comprises part of the work for which such bid or proposal is submitted.(m)Dams, including both earth dams and concrete dams, designed for electrical generation, water storage, or any other purpose may be constructed by either a commercial general contractor licensed under this chapter or by a utility contractor licensed pursuant to Chapter 14 of this title.(n)Nothing in this chapter shall apply to the construction or installation of manufactured homes as defined in paragraph (4) of Code Section8-2-131.Amended by 2024 Ga.

Laws 598 in an appropriations Act enacted by the General Assembly.\n\n(a)No person, whether an individual or a business organization, shall have the right to engage in the business of residential contracting or commercial general contracting without a current, valid residential contractor license or commercial general contractor license, respectively, issued by the division under this chapter or, in the case of a business organization, unless such business organization shall have a qualifying agent as provided in this chapter holding such a current, valid residential contractor or commercial general contractor license on behalf of such organization issued to such qualifying agent as provided in this chapter.(b)As a matter of public policy, any contract entered into on or after July 1, 2008, for the performance of work for which a residential contractor or commercial general contractor license is required by this chapter and not otherwise exempted under this chapter and which is between an owner and a contractor who does not have a valid and current license required for such work in accordance with this chapter shall be unenforceable in law or in equity by the unlicensed contractor. For purposes of this subsection, a contractor shall be considered unlicensed only if the contractor was unlicensed on the effective date of the original contract for the work, if stated therein, or, if not stated, the date the last party to the contract executed such contract, if stated therein. If the contract does not establish such a date, the contractor shall be considered unlicensed only if the contractor was unlicensed on the first date upon which the contractor provided labor, services, or materials under the contract. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if a contract is rendered unenforceable under this subsection, no lien or bond claim shall exist in favor of the unlicensed contractor for any labor, services, or materials provided under the contract or any amendment thereto. This subsection shall not affect the rights of parties other than the unlicensed contractor to enforce contract, lien, or bond remedies. This subsection shall not affect the obligations of a surety that has provided a bond on behalf of an unlicensed contractor. It shall not be a defense to any claim on a bond or indemnity agreement that the principal or indemnitor is unlicensed for purposes of this subsection.(c)Any person who holds a license issued under this chapter may engage in the business of residential or commercial general contracting, but only as prescribed by the license, throughout the state and no municipality or county may require any such person licensed under this chapter to comply with any additional licensing requirements imposed by such municipality or county relative to the performance of construction work subject to the licensing requirements under this chapter. However, nothing in this chapter shall preclude the implementation and enforcement by any municipality or county of a local rule, regulation, ordinance, order, or other requirement in effect and operation as of July 1, 2004, that requires a person to obtain a locally issued license, registration, or certification in order to:(1)Engage in the construction of improvements to real property to the extent such activities are not encompassed by this chapter or by Chapter 14 of this title; or(2)Engage in residential or commercial general contracting within such jurisdiction; provided, however, that:(A)The requirements and criteria for issuance of such local license, registration, or certification shall have been at least as strict and stringent, in the sole judgment of the board, as those for the issuance of a corresponding state-wide license issued under this chapter;(B)Such local license, registration, or certification shall only apply to activities performed within the geographical limits of such municipality or county; and(C)Such requirement shall not prevent or foreclose any contractor not holding such local license, registration, or certification but holding a valid and current state-wide license issued under this chapter or Chapter 14 of this title from the transaction of contracting business in such local jurisdiction within the scope of his or her state-wide license.(d)Any person qualified by the Department of Transportation to perform construction work on roads, streets, bridges, highways, sidewalks, or other grading, paving, or repaving projects; airport runways or taxiways; or railroads, and services incidental thereto, for the department shall not be required to be licensed under this chapter in order to perform any such work for the department or for any other owner requiring similar work to be performed. The commercial general contractor division of the board, in agreement with the Department of Transportation, shall, by rule, define \"services incidental thereto\" for the purposes of this subsection only and shall likewise define any other necessary terms as to the scope of the exemption provided by this subsection.(e)Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any person holding a valid license issued by the State Construction Industry Licensing Board, or any division thereof, pursuant to Chapter 14 of this title from performing any work defined in the Code sections under which the license held by said person was issued. Furthermore, nothing in this chapter shall preclude a person licensed under Chapter 14 of this title to perform plumbing, conditioned air contracting, utility contracting, electrical contracting, or low-voltage contracting from offering to perform, performing, engaging in, or contracting to engage in the performance of construction work or services directly with an owner, which work would otherwise require a license under this chapter, where the total scope of the work to be performed is predominantly of the type for which such contractor is duly licensed to perform under Chapter 14 of this title such that any other work involved is incidental to and an integral part of the work performed within the scope of such license under said chapter and does not exceed the greater of $10,000.00 or 25 percent of the total value at the time of contracting of the work to be performed; provided, however, that such contractor may not delegate or assign the responsibility to directly supervise and manage the performance of such other work to a person unless such person is licensed under this chapter and the work being performed by such person is within the scope of that person's license.(f)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude a specialty contractor from offering or contracting to perform or undertaking or performing for an owner limited, specialty, or specific trade contractor work. However, nothing in this chapter shall permit a specialty contractor to perform work falling within the licensing requirements of Chapter 14 of this title where such specialty contractor is not duly licensed under such chapter to perform such work. The board shall, by rule or policy, identify specialty contractors or other criteria to determine eligibility under the exemption of this subsection. The specialty contractor otherwise exempted from license requirements under this chapter may perform work for an owner that would otherwise require a license under this chapter where the total scope of the work to be performed is predominantly of the type for which such specialty contractor is duly recognized as exempt under this subsection by the board, provided that such other work involved is incidental to and an integral part of the exempt work performed by the specialty contractor and does not exceed the greater of $10,000.00 or 25 percent of the total value at the time of contracting of the work to be performed.(g)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude a person from offering or contracting to perform or undertaking or performing for an owner repair work, provided that the person performing the repair work discloses to the owner that such person does not hold a license under this chapter and provided, further, that such work does not affect the structural integrity of the real property. The board shall by rule or regulation further define the term \"repair\" as used in this subsection and any other necessary terms as to the scope of this exemption.(h)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude any person from constructing a building or structure on real property owned by such person which is intended upon completion for use or occupancy solely by that person and his or her family, firm, or corporation and its employees, and not for use by the general public and not offered for sale or lease. In so doing, such person may act as his or her own contractor personally providing direct supervision and management of all work not performed by licensed contractors. However, if, under this subsection, the person or his or her family, firm, or corporation has previously sold or transferred a building or structure which had been constructed by such person acting without a licensed residential or commercial general contractor within the prior 24 month period, starting from the date on which a certificate of occupancy was issued for such building or structure, then such person may not, under this subsection, construct another separate building or structure without having first obtained on his or her own behalf an appropriate residential or commercial general contractor license or having engaged such a duly licensed contractor to perform such work to the extent required under this chapter, or it shall be presumed that the person, firm, or corporation did not intend such building solely for occupancy by that person and his or her family, firm, or corporation. Further, such person may not delegate the responsibility to directly supervise and manage all or any part of the work relating thereto to any other person unless that person is licensed under this chapter and the work being performed is within the scope of that person's license. In any event, however, all such work must be done in conformity with all other applicable provisions of this title, the rules and regulations of the board and division involved, and any applicable county or municipal resolutions, ordinances, codes, permitting, or inspection requirements.(i)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude an architect licensed pursuant to Chapter 4 of this title, an interior designer registered pursuant to Chapter 4 of this title, or an engineer registered pursuant to Chapter 15 of this title from performing work or providing services within the scope of his or her registration for the practice of architecture or interior design or license for practicing engineering.(j)Nothing in this chapter shall preclude an architect licensed pursuant to Chapter 4 of this title, an interior designer registered pursuant to Chapter 4 of this title, or an engineer registered pursuant to Chapter 15 of this title from offering to perform or offering or rendering design-build services to an owner; provided, however, that such offer or contract shall clearly indicate at the time of such offer or contract that all services of a commercial general contractor incident to the design-build performance shall be performed by a duly licensed commercial general contractor in compliance with other provisions of this chapter and that all services so offered or provided falling within the scope of the licensing requirements of this chapter are offered and rendered by a licensed commercial general contractor in accordance with this chapter.(k)Nothing in this chapter shall apply to the construction, alteration, or repair of buildings classified as an agricultural occupancy or that are used for agricultural storage or agricultural purposes.(l)A contractor licensed under this chapter shall not be required to list on the face of a bid or proposal envelope the license number of any contractor licensed under Chapter 14 of this title that may or will be engaged to perform any work within the licensing requirements of Chapter 14 of this title which comprises part of the work for which such bid or proposal is submitted.(m)Dams, including both earth dams and concrete dams, designed for electrical generation, water storage, or any other purpose may be constructed by either a commercial general contractor licensed under this chapter or by a utility contractor licensed pursuant to Chapter 14 of this title.(n)Nothing in this chapter shall apply to the construction or installation of manufactured homes as defined in paragraph (4) of Code Section8-2-131.Amended by 2024 Ga.
