The Commissioner may also employ such other guidelines as the Commissioner may deem appropriate.(2)Every licensee or person from whom information is sought, its officers, directors, and agents shall provide to the examiners timely, convenient, and free access at all reasonable hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents, assets, and computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business, and affairs of the licensee being examined. The officers, directors, employees, and agents of the licensee or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees, or agents, to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the Commissioner shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the licensee to engage in the life settlement business or other business subject to the Commissioner's jurisdiction. Any proceedings for suspension, revocation, or refusal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to Chapter 2 of this title.(3)The Commissioner shall have the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths, and to examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the examination.

Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima-facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.(6)Nothing contained in this Code section shall be construed to limit the Commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or licensee work papers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action which the Commissioner may, in his or her sole discretion, deem appropriate.(f)(1)Examination reports shall be composed of (A) only facts appearing upon the books, records, or other documents of the licensee, its agents, or other persons examined or as ascertained from the testimony of the licensee's officers or agents or other persons examined concerning the licensee's affairs and (B) such conclusions and recommendations as the examiners find reasonably warranted from the facts.(2)No later than 60 days following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall file with the Commissioner a verified written report of examination under oath. Upon receipt of the verified report, the Commissioner shall transmit the report to the licensee examined, together with a notice that shall afford the licensee examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than 30 days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the examination report and which shall become part of the report or to request a hearing on any matter in dispute if the Commissioner deems such written submission or rebuttal comments appropriate and consistent with the findings of the examination.(3)In the event the Commissioner determines that regulatory action is appropriate as a result of an examination, the Commissioner may initiate any proceedings or actions provided by law.(g)(1)Names and individual identification data for all owners, purchasers, and insureds shall be considered private and confidential information and shall not be disclosed by the Commissioner unless the disclosure is to another regulator or is required by law.(2)Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all examination reports, working papers, recorded information, documents, and copies thereof produced by, obtained by, or disclosed to the Commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination made under this chapter or in the course of analysis or investigation by the Commissioner of the financial condition or market conduct of a licensee shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to the provisions of Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action.

Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest paid on account of the provider within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the provider.(j)Within three business days after receipt from the owner of documents to effect the transfer of the insurance policy, the provider shall pay the proceeds of the settlement to an escrow or trust account managed by a trustee or escrow agent in a state or federally chartered financial institution pending acknowledgment of the transfer by issuer of the policy. The trustee or escrow agent shall be required to transfer the proceeds due to the owner within three business days of acknowledgment of the transfer from the insurer.(k)Failure to tender the life settlement contract proceeds to the owner by the date disclosed to the owner renders the contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time the proceeds are tendered to and accepted by the owner. A failure to give written notice of the right of rescission hereunder shall toll the right of rescission until 30 days after the written notice of the right of rescission has been given.(l)Any fee paid by a provider, party, individual, or an owner to a life settlement broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life settlement contract shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained, not the face value of the policy. Nothing in this Code section shall be construed to prohibit a life settlement broker from reducing such life settlement broker's fee below this percentage if the life settlement broker so chooses.(m)The life settlement broker shall disclose to the owner any thing of value paid or given to a life settlement broker which relates to a life settlement contract.(n)No person at any time prior to, or at the time of, the application for, or issuance of, a policy, or during a two-year period commencing with the date of issuance of the policy, shall enter into a life settlement contract regardless of the date the compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the assignment, transfer, sale, devise, bequest, or surrender of the policy is to occur. This prohibition shall not apply if the owner certifies to the provider that:(1)The policy was issued upon the owner's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy, provided that the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is at least 24 months. The time covered under a group policy shall be calculated without regard to a change in insurance carriers, provided that the coverage has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship; or(2)The owner submits independent evidence to the provider that one or more of the following conditions have been met within the two-year period:(A)The owner or insured is terminally or chronically ill;(B)The owner or insured disposes of his or her ownership interests in a closely held corporation, pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other similar agreement in effect at the time the insurance policy was initially issued;(C)The owner's spouse dies;(D)The owner divorces his or her spouse;(E)The owner retires from full-time employment;(F)The owner becomes physically or mentally disabled and a physician determines that the disability prevents the owner from maintaining full-time employment; or(G)A final order, judgment, or decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of a creditor of the owner, adjudicating the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the owner or appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the owner's assets.Copies of the independent evidence required by paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be submitted to the insurer when the provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the provider. Nothing in this Code section shall prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of any policy. If the provider submits to the insurer a copy of independent evidence provided for in paragraph (2) of this subsection when the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy to the provider, the copy is deemed to establish that the settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this subsection.Amended by 2019 Ga.
