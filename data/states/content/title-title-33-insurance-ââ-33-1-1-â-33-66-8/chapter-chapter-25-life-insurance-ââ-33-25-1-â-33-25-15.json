      "text": "(a)Except as provided in subsection (b) of this Code section, no policy of life insurance shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions:(1)Grace period.A provision that the insured is entitled to a grace period of not less than 30 days within which the payment of any premium after the first may be made, during which period of grace the policy shall continue in force; but if a claim arises under the policy during the grace period, the amount of any premium due or overdue may be deducted from any amount payable under the policy in settlement;(2)Incontestability.A provision that the policy exclusive of provisions relating to disability benefits or to additional benefits in the event of death by accident or accidental means shall be incontestable, except for nonpayment of premiums, after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for a period of two years from its date of issue;(3)Misstatement of age.A provision that, if the age of the person insured or of any other person whose age is considered in determining the premium or benefit has been misstated, any amount payable or any benefit accruing under the policy shall be such as the premium would have purchased at the correct age or ages;(4)Dividends.A provision in participating policies that, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year, the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion the divisible surplus, if any, that will accrue on the policy anniversary or other dividend date specified in the policy. Except as provided in this paragraph, any dividend becoming payable shall at the option of the party entitled to elect such option be either payable in cash or applied to any one of such other dividend options as may be provided by the policy. If any other dividend options are provided, the policy shall further state which option shall be automatically effective if the party shall not have elected some other option. If a policy specifies a period within which the other option may be elected, the period shall be not less than 30 days following the date on which the dividend is due and payable. The annually apportioned dividend shall be deemed to be payable in cash within the meaning set forth in this paragraph, even though the policy provides that payment of the dividend is to be deferred for a specified period, provided the period does not exceed six years from the date of apportionment and that interest will be added to the dividend at a specified rate. If a participating policy provides that the benefit under any paid-up nonforfeiture provision is to be participating, it may provide that any divisible surplus becoming payable or apportioned while the insurance is in force under the nonforfeiture provision shall be applied in the manner set forth in the policy;(5)Policy loan.A provision that after three full years' premiums have been paid, and after the policy has a cash surrender value, and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period for payment, the insurer will loan on the execution of a proper note or loan agreement by the owner of the policy, and on proper assignment of the policy and on the sole security of the policy, at a specified rate of interest, a sum equal to or, at the option of the owner of the policy, less than the cash value of the policy at the end of the current policy year including any dividend additions to the policy. The company may deduct from the loan value or from the proceeds of the loan any existing indebtedness on or secured by the policy not already deducted in determining the cash value, including interest due or accrued, and any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and may collect interest in advance of the loan through the end of the current policy year. The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for six months after application for such deferment. The policy may also provide that if interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due, it shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate, and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value of the policy, then the policy shall terminate and become void, but not until at least 30 days' notice shall have been mailed by the insurer to the last known address of the insured or policy owner and to that of any assignee of record at the home office of the insurer. The policy, at the insurer's option, may provide for an automatic premium loan, subject to an election of the party entitled to elect. No condition other than as provided in this paragraph shall be exacted as a prerequisite to any loan. This provision shall not apply to term insurance or to term insurance benefits provided by rider or supplemental policy provisions;(6)Tables of installments.In case the policy provides that the proceeds may be payable in installments which are determinable at issue of the policy, there shall be a table showing the amounts of the guaranteed installments;(7)Tables of options and values.In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate, and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy. In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary, either during the first 20 policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy;(8)Reinstatement.A provision that unless the policy has been surrendered for its cash surrender value or its cash surrender value has been exhausted, or unless the paid-up term insurance, if any, has expired, the policy will be reinstated at any time within three years from the date of premium default upon written application for reinstatement, the production of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer, the payment of all premiums in arrears, and the payment or reinstatement of any other indebtedness to the insurer upon the policy all with interest not exceeding 6 percent per annum compounded annually;(9)Title.On each such policy there shall be placed a title which shall briefly and accurately describe the nature and form of the policy;(10)Payment of premiums.A provision relative to the payment of premiums;(11)Payment of claims.A provision that, when a policy shall become a claim by the death of the insured, settlement shall be made upon receipt of due proof of death and, at the insurer's option, surrender of the policy and proof of the interest of the claimant. If an insurer shall specify a particular period prior to the expiration of which settlement shall be made, the period shall not exceed two months from the receipt of such proofs;(12)Entire contract.A provision that, if any reference is made to the application for insurance or to the constitution, bylaws, or rules of the insurer as forming part of or as affecting the policy between the parties, there shall be included in or attached to the policy, when issued, a correct copy of the application signed by the applicant and of the constitution, bylaws, and rules to which reference is made.(b)Any of the provisions enumerated in subsection (a) of this Code section or portions thereof not applicable to single premium or term policies shall to that extent not be incorporated in single premium or term policies. This Code section shall not apply to credit or group insurance, or to any provision of a life insurance policy, or contract supplemental to a life insurance policy, relating to disability benefits or to additional benefits in event of death by accident or accidental means.\n\n(a)Except as provided in subsection (b) of this Code section, no policy of life insurance shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions:(1)Grace period.A provision that the insured is entitled to a grace period of not less than 30 days within which the payment of any premium after the first may be made, during which period of grace the policy shall continue in force; but if a claim arises under the policy during the grace period, the amount of any premium due or overdue may be deducted from any amount payable under the policy in settlement;(2)Incontestability.A provision that the policy exclusive of provisions relating to disability benefits or to additional benefits in the event of death by accident or accidental means shall be incontestable, except for nonpayment of premiums, after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for a period of two years from its date of issue;(3)Misstatement of age.A provision that, if the age of the person insured or of any other person whose age is considered in determining the premium or benefit has been misstated, any amount payable or any benefit accruing under the policy shall be such as the premium would have purchased at the correct age or ages;(4)Dividends.A provision in participating policies that, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year, the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion the divisible surplus, if any, that will accrue on the policy anniversary or other dividend date specified in the policy. Except as provided in this paragraph, any dividend becoming payable shall at the option of the party entitled to elect such option be either payable in cash or applied to any one of such other dividend options as may be provided by the policy. If any other dividend options are provided, the policy shall further state which option shall be automatically effective if the party shall not have elected some other option. If a policy specifies a period within which the other option may be elected, the period shall be not less than 30 days following the date on which the dividend is due and payable. The annually apportioned dividend shall be deemed to be payable in cash within the meaning set forth in this paragraph, even though the policy provides that payment of the dividend is to be deferred for a specified period, provided the period does not exceed six years from the date of apportionment and that interest will be added to the dividend at a specified rate.

      "text": "(a)(1)Except as provided in subsection (f) of this Code section, no policy of life insurance issued on or after January 1, 1966, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it shall contain the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the Commissioner are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are in the minimum requirements hereinafter specified and are essentially in compliance with subsection (h) of this Code section:(A)A provision that, in the event of default in any premium payment, the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as specified in subsection (c) of this Code section. In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits;(B)A provision that, upon surrender of the policy, within 60 days after the due date of any premium payment in default, after premiums have been paid for at least three full years, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as specified in subsection (b) of this Code section;(C)A provision that a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default;(D)A provision that, if the policy shall have become paid up by completion of all premium payments, or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within 30 days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as specified in subsection (b) of this Code section;(E)An explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions, credited to the policy, or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated in the policy, a statement that the method of computation has been filed with the supervisory insurance official of the state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which the values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.(2)Any of the provisions or portions thereof set forth in subparagraphs (a)(1)(A) through (a)(1)(E) of this Code section not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.(3)The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.(b)(1)Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value on the anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsections (d) and (e) of this Code section, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after the anniversary and the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.(2)Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e) of this Code section as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.(3)Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e) of this Code section as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age 71, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.(4)Any cash surrender value available within 30 days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be an amount not less than the present value on the anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.(c)Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of the anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this Code section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.(d)(1)This subsection shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e) of this Code section as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section, except that, with respect to such policies for which the gross premium during the first policy year includes any additional amounts for which no comparable additional benefit is provided during that year, this subsection shall continue to apply until the effective date of subsection (h) of this Code section. Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage or percentages of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy and excluding any additional amounts payable during the first policy year for which there are no comparable additional insurance benefits provided during that year, that the present value at the date of issue of the policy of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (A) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (B) 2 percent of the amount of the insurance if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as defined in paragraph (3) of this subsection, if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy; (C) 40 percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year; (D) 25 percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less, reduced by (E) any additional amounts payable during the first policy year for which there are no comparable additional insurance benefits provided during that year.(2)The adjusted premiums shall be a single uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, unless the adjusted premiums result in cash surrender values which are smaller than endowment amounts provided by the policy prior to maturity as of the date or dates such endowment amounts are provided, in which event the adjusted premiums shall be determined as uniform percentages of the respective premiums specified in the policy such that no cash surrender value is smaller than any endowment amount provided by the policy prior to maturity as of the date or dates such endowment amount is provided. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Commissioner may treat any cash surrender value actually provided by the policy as equivalent to an endowment amount; provided, however, that in applying the percentages specified in items (C) and (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed 4 percent of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this Code section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.(3)In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with the duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount of insurance, for the purpose of this subsection, shall be deemed to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration, and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy; provided, however, that, in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten was the amount provided by the policy at age ten. In the case of a policy which provides pure endowment benefits which are payable without reducing the amount of insurance provided by the policy and which may be applied to provide additional amounts of paid-up life insurance, the equivalent uniform amount of insurance shall be determined on the amounts of insurance which would be effective if all the pure endowment benefits were applied to provide such additional amounts of paid-up life insurance.(4)The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to (A) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (B) the adjusted premiums for such term insurance, items (A) and (B) of this paragraph being calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection, except that, for the purpose of items (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in item (B) of this paragraph shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in item (A) of this paragraph.(5)All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this Code section shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that, for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured. Such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; provided, however, that any insurer may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election that such adjusted premiums and present values shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table, after a specified date before January 1, 1968, and, whether or not any election has been made, such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance, issued on or after January 1, 1968, shall be made on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. Such rate of interest shall not exceed 3 1/2 percent per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding 4 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1973; and prior to July 1, 1979, a rate of interest not exceeding 5 1/2 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1979; and for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy, a rate of interest not exceeding 6 1/2 percent per annum may be used. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed in the case of ordinary policies may not be more than those shown in the Commissioners 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table and in the case of industrial policies may not be more than 130 percent of the rates of mortality according to the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. After January 1, 1968, when the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table becomes applicable, such rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the Commissioner.(e)(1)As used in this subsection, the term \"operative date of the valuation manual\" has the same meaning as in paragraph (2) of subsection (o) of Code Section33-10-13.(1.1)This subsection shall apply to any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1989, or such earlier date as may have been elected by the insurer with respect to such policy in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (11) of this subsection. Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (A) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (B) one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and (C) 125 percent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as defined in this subsection; provided, however, that in applying the percentage specified in item (C) of this paragraph no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed 4 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.(2)The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.(3)In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that the future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.(4)Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (7) of this subsection, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of (A) the sum of (i) the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and (ii) the additional expense allowance, if any, over (B) the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.(5)The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of (A) 1 percent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and (B) 125 percent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.(6)The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (A) by (B) where:(A)Equals the sum of:(i)The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred; and(ii)The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and(B)Equals the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.(7)Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.(8)All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this Code section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of (A) the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or (B) at the election of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors; shall for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; and shall for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this subsection for policies issued in that calendar year; provided, however, that:(A)At the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year;(B)Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any;(C)An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values;(D)In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance;(E)For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the aforementioned tables;(F)For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that are approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual; and(G)For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners standard industrial mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that are approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners standard industrial mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.(9)The nonforfeiture interest rate is defined as follows:(A)For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to 125 percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in Code Section33-10-13, the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearer one quarter of 1 percent; provided, however, that the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than 4 percent.(B)For policies issued on and after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.(10)Notwithstanding any other provision in this title to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.(11)After November 1, 1982, any insurer may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection with respect to specified policy forms after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such specified policy forms. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such insurer shall be January 1, 1989.(f)In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this Code section, then:(1)The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsections (a) through (e) of this Code section;(2)The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds;(3)The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by such plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this Code section, as determined by regulations promulgated by the Commissioner.(g)Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary, except that, in the case of industrial insurance, proportionate increases in value may be calculated on the basis of quarter-year payment. All values referred to in subsections (b) through (e) of this Code section may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this Code section, additional benefits payable (1) in the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means; (2) in the event of total and permanent disability; (3) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits; (4) as term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this Code section would not apply; (5) as term insurance on the life of a child, or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if the term insurance expires before the child attains age 26, is uniform in amount after the child attains age one and has not become paid up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; or (6) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this Code section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.(h)(1)This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this Code section, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986, except that, with respect to such policies for which the gross premium during the first policy year includes any additional amounts for which no comparable additional benefit is provided during that year, this subsection shall apply to any such policies issued after a specified operative date before January 1, 1986, as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two tenths of 1 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of (A) the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified and (B) the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy.(2)The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value on such anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary; provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection (b) or (d) of this Code section, whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection (b) or (d) of this Code section, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.(3)The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection (d) or (e) of this Code section, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by paragraph (4) of this subsection, such percentage:(A)Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (i) the fifth policy anniversary and (ii) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two tenths of 1 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and(B)Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years.(4)Provided, that no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection (d) or (e) of this Code section, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.(5)All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections of this Code section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.(6)Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), and (g) of this Code section. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed as items (1) through (6) in subsection (g) of this Code section shall conform with the principles of this subsection.(i)This Code section shall not apply to any of the following:(1)Reinsurance;(2)Group insurance;(3)Pure endowment;(4)Annuity or reversionary annuity contract;(5)Term policy of uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;(6)Term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in subsections (d) and (e) of this Code section, is less than the adjusted premium so calculated on a term policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy; or(7)Policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Code section, exceeds 2 1/2 percent of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year.For purposes of determining the applicability of this Code section, the age at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the oldest life.Amended by 2018 Ga.

Laws 120,§ 2, eff. 7/1/2015.\n\n(a)(1)Except as provided in subsection (f) of this Code section, no policy of life insurance issued on or after January 1, 1966, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it shall contain the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the Commissioner are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are in the minimum requirements hereinafter specified and are essentially in compliance with subsection (h) of this Code section:(A)A provision that, in the event of default in any premium payment, the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as specified in subsection (c) of this Code section. In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits;(B)A provision that, upon surrender of the policy, within 60 days after the due date of any premium payment in default, after premiums have been paid for at least three full years, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as specified in subsection (b) of this Code section;(C)A provision that a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default;(D)A provision that, if the policy shall have become paid up by completion of all premium payments, or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within 30 days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as specified in subsection (b) of this Code section;(E)An explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions, credited to the policy, or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated in the policy, a statement that the method of computation has been filed with the supervisory insurance official of the state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which the values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.(2)Any of the provisions or portions thereof set forth in subparagraphs (a)(1)(A) through (a)(1)(E) of this Code section not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.(3)The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.(b)(1)Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value on the anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsections (d) and (e) of this Code section, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after the anniversary and the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.(2)Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e) of this Code section as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.(3)Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e) of this Code section as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age 71, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.(4)Any cash surrender value available within 30 days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be an amount not less than the present value on the anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.(c)Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of the anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this Code section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.(d)(1)This subsection shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e) of this Code section as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section, except that, with respect to such policies for which the gross premium during the first policy year includes any additional amounts for which no comparable additional benefit is provided during that year, this subsection shall continue to apply until the effective date of subsection (h) of this Code section. Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage or percentages of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy and excluding any additional amounts payable during the first policy year for which there are no comparable additional insurance benefits provided during that year, that the present value at the date of issue of the policy of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (A) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (B) 2 percent of the amount of the insurance if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as defined in paragraph (3) of this subsection, if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy; (C) 40 percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year; (D) 25 percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less, reduced by (E) any additional amounts payable during the first policy year for which there are no comparable additional insurance benefits provided during that year.(2)The adjusted premiums shall be a single uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, unless the adjusted premiums result in cash surrender values which are smaller than endowment amounts provided by the policy prior to maturity as of the date or dates such endowment amounts are provided, in which event the adjusted premiums shall be determined as uniform percentages of the respective premiums specified in the policy such that no cash surrender value is smaller than any endowment amount provided by the policy prior to maturity as of the date or dates such endowment amount is provided. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Commissioner may treat any cash surrender value actually provided by the policy as equivalent to an endowment amount; provided, however, that in applying the percentages specified in items (C) and (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed 4 percent of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this Code section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.(3)In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with the duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount of insurance, for the purpose of this subsection, shall be deemed to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration, and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy; provided, however, that, in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten was the amount provided by the policy at age ten. In the case of a policy which provides pure endowment benefits which are payable without reducing the amount of insurance provided by the policy and which may be applied to provide additional amounts of paid-up life insurance, the equivalent uniform amount of insurance shall be determined on the amounts of insurance which would be effective if all the pure endowment benefits were applied to provide such additional amounts of paid-up life insurance.(4)The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to (A) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (B) the adjusted premiums for such term insurance, items (A) and (B) of this paragraph being calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection, except that, for the purpose of items (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in item (B) of this paragraph shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in item (A) of this paragraph.(5)All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this Code section shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that, for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured. Such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; provided, however, that any insurer may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election that such adjusted premiums and present values shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table, after a specified date before January 1, 1968, and, whether or not any election has been made, such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance, issued on or after January 1, 1968, shall be made on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. Such rate of interest shall not exceed 3 1/2 percent per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding 4 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1973; and prior to July 1, 1979, a rate of interest not exceeding 5 1/2 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1979; and for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy, a rate of interest not exceeding 6 1/2 percent per annum may be used. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed in the case of ordinary policies may not be more than those shown in the Commissioners 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table and in the case of industrial policies may not be more than 130 percent of the rates of mortality according to the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. After January 1, 1968, when the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table becomes applicable, such rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the Commissioner.(e)(1)As used in this subsection, the term \"operative date of the valuation manual\" has the same meaning as in paragraph (2) of subsection (o) of Code Section33-10-13.(1.1)This subsection shall apply to any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1989, or such earlier date as may have been elected by the insurer with respect to such policy in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (11) of this subsection. Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (A) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (B) one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and (C) 125 percent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as defined in this subsection; provided, however, that in applying the percentage specified in item (C) of this paragraph no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed 4 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.(2)The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.(3)In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that the future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.(4)Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (7) of this subsection, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of (A) the sum of (i) the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and (ii) the additional expense allowance, if any, over (B) the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.(5)The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of (A) 1 percent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and (B) 125 percent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.(6)The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (A) by (B) where:(A)Equals the sum of:(i)The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred; and(ii)The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and(B)Equals the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.(7)Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.(8)All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this Code section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of (A) the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or (B) at the election of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors; shall for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; and shall for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this subsection for policies issued in that calendar year; provided, however, that:(A)At the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year;(B)Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any;(C)An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values;(D)In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance;(E)For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the aforementioned tables;(F)For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that are approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual; and(G)For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners standard industrial mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that are approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners standard industrial mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.(9)The nonforfeiture interest rate is defined as follows:(A)For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to 125 percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in Code Section33-10-13, the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearer one quarter of 1 percent; provided, however, that the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than 4 percent.(B)For policies issued on and after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.(10)Notwithstanding any other provision in this title to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.(11)After November 1, 1982, any insurer may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection with respect to specified policy forms after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such specified policy forms. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such insurer shall be January 1, 1989.(f)In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this Code section, then:(1)The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsections (a) through (e) of this Code section;(2)The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds;(3)The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by such plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this Code section, as determined by regulations promulgated by the Commissioner.(g)Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary, except that, in the case of industrial insurance, proportionate increases in value may be calculated on the basis of quarter-year payment. All values referred to in subsections (b) through (e) of this Code section may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this Code section, additional benefits payable (1) in the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means; (2) in the event of total and permanent disability; (3) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits; (4) as term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this Code section would not apply; (5) as term insurance on the life of a child, or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if the term insurance expires before the child attains age 26, is uniform in amount after the child attains age one and has not become paid up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; or (6) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this Code section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.(h)(1)This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this Code section, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986, except that, with respect to such policies for which the gross premium during the first policy year includes any additional amounts for which no comparable additional benefit is provided during that year, this subsection shall apply to any such policies issued after a specified operative date before January 1, 1986, as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two tenths of 1 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of (A) the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified and (B) the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy.(2)The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value on such anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary; provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection (b) or (d) of this Code section, whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection (b) or (d) of this Code section, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.(3)The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection (d) or (e) of this Code section, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by paragraph (4) of this subsection, such percentage:(A)Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (i) the fifth policy anniversary and (ii) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two tenths of 1 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and(B)Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years.(4)Provided, that no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection (d) or (e) of this Code section, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.(5)All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections of this Code section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.(6)Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), and (g) of this Code section. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed as items (1) through (6) in subsection (g) of this Code section shall conform with the principles of this subsection.(i)This Code section shall not apply to any of the following:(1)Reinsurance;(2)Group insurance;(3)Pure endowment;(4)Annuity or reversionary annuity contract;(5)Term policy of uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;(6)Term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in subsections (d) and (e) of this Code section, is less than the adjusted premium so calculated on a term policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy; or(7)Policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Code section, exceeds 2 1/2 percent of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year.For purposes of determining the applicability of this Code section, the age at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the oldest life.Amended by 2018 Ga.

Laws 120,§ 2, eff. 7/1/2015.\n\n(a)(1)Except as provided in subsection (f) of this Code section, no policy of life insurance issued on or after January 1, 1966, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it shall contain the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the Commissioner are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are in the minimum requirements hereinafter specified and are essentially in compliance with subsection (h) of this Code section:(A)A provision that, in the event of default in any premium payment, the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as specified in subsection (c) of this Code section. In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits;(B)A provision that, upon surrender of the policy, within 60 days after the due date of any premium payment in default, after premiums have been paid for at least three full years, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as specified in subsection (b) of this Code section;(C)A provision that a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default;(D)A provision that, if the policy shall have become paid up by completion of all premium payments, or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within 30 days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as specified in subsection (b) of this Code section;(E)An explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions, credited to the policy, or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated in the policy, a statement that the method of computation has been filed with the supervisory insurance official of the state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which the values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.(2)Any of the provisions or portions thereof set forth in subparagraphs (a)(1)(A) through (a)(1)(E) of this Code section not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.(3)The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.(b)(1)Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value on the anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsections (d) and (e) of this Code section, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after the anniversary and the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.(2)Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e) of this Code section as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.(3)Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e) of this Code section as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age 71, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.(4)Any cash surrender value available within 30 days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be an amount not less than the present value on the anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.(c)Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of the anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this Code section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.(d)(1)This subsection shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e) of this Code section as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section, except that, with respect to such policies for which the gross premium during the first policy year includes any additional amounts for which no comparable additional benefit is provided during that year, this subsection shall continue to apply until the effective date of subsection (h) of this Code section. Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage or percentages of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy and excluding any additional amounts payable during the first policy year for which there are no comparable additional insurance benefits provided during that year, that the present value at the date of issue of the policy of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (A) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (B) 2 percent of the amount of the insurance if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as defined in paragraph (3) of this subsection, if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy; (C) 40 percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year; (D) 25 percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less, reduced by (E) any additional amounts payable during the first policy year for which there are no comparable additional insurance benefits provided during that year.(2)The adjusted premiums shall be a single uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, unless the adjusted premiums result in cash surrender values which are smaller than endowment amounts provided by the policy prior to maturity as of the date or dates such endowment amounts are provided, in which event the adjusted premiums shall be determined as uniform percentages of the respective premiums specified in the policy such that no cash surrender value is smaller than any endowment amount provided by the policy prior to maturity as of the date or dates such endowment amount is provided. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Commissioner may treat any cash surrender value actually provided by the policy as equivalent to an endowment amount; provided, however, that in applying the percentages specified in items (C) and (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed 4 percent of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this Code section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.(3)In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with the duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount of insurance, for the purpose of this subsection, shall be deemed to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration, and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy; provided, however, that, in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten was the amount provided by the policy at age ten. In the case of a policy which provides pure endowment benefits which are payable without reducing the amount of insurance provided by the policy and which may be applied to provide additional amounts of paid-up life insurance, the equivalent uniform amount of insurance shall be determined on the amounts of insurance which would be effective if all the pure endowment benefits were applied to provide such additional amounts of paid-up life insurance.(4)The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to (A) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by (B) the adjusted premiums for such term insurance, items (A) and (B) of this paragraph being calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection, except that, for the purpose of items (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in item (B) of this paragraph shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in item (A) of this paragraph.(5)All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this Code section shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that, for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured. Such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; provided, however, that any insurer may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election that such adjusted premiums and present values shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table, after a specified date before January 1, 1968, and, whether or not any election has been made, such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance, issued on or after January 1, 1968, shall be made on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. Such rate of interest shall not exceed 3 1/2 percent per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding 4 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1973; and prior to July 1, 1979, a rate of interest not exceeding 5 1/2 percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1979; and for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy, a rate of interest not exceeding 6 1/2 percent per annum may be used. In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed in the case of ordinary policies may not be more than those shown in the Commissioners 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table and in the case of industrial policies may not be more than 130 percent of the rates of mortality according to the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table. After January 1, 1968, when the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table becomes applicable, such rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the Commissioner.(e)(1)As used in this subsection, the term \"operative date of the valuation manual\" has the same meaning as in paragraph (2) of subsection (o) of Code Section33-10-13.(1.1)This subsection shall apply to any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1989, or such earlier date as may have been elected by the insurer with respect to such policy in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (11) of this subsection. Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of (A) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (B) one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and (C) 125 percent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as defined in this subsection; provided, however, that in applying the percentage specified in item (C) of this paragraph no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed 4 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this subsection shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.(2)The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.(3)In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that the future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.(4)Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (7) of this subsection, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of (A) the sum of (i) the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and (ii) the additional expense allowance, if any, over (B) the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.(5)The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of (A) 1 percent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and (B) 125 percent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.(6)The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (A) by (B) where:(A)Equals the sum of:(i)The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred; and(ii)The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and(B)Equals the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.(7)Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.(8)All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this Code section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of (A) the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table or (B) at the election of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors; shall for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; and shall for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this subsection for policies issued in that calendar year; provided, however, that:(A)At the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year;(B)Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by subsection (a) of this Code section, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any;(C)An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values;(D)In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance;(E)For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the aforementioned tables;(F)For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that are approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual; and(G)For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any Commissioners standard industrial mortality tables adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that are approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the Commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table. If the Commissioner approves by regulation any Commissioners standard industrial mortality table adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.(9)The nonforfeiture interest rate is defined as follows:(A)For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to 125 percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in Code Section33-10-13, the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearer one quarter of 1 percent; provided, however, that the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than 4 percent.(B)For policies issued on and after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.(10)Notwithstanding any other provision in this title to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.(11)After November 1, 1982, any insurer may file with the Commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subsection with respect to specified policy forms after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this subsection for such specified policy forms. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subsection for such insurer shall be January 1, 1989.(f)In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this Code section, then:(1)The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsections (a) through (e) of this Code section;(2)The Commissioner must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds;(3)The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by such plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this Code section, as determined by regulations promulgated by the Commissioner.(g)Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary, except that, in the case of industrial insurance, proportionate increases in value may be calculated on the basis of quarter-year payment. All values referred to in subsections (b) through (e) of this Code section may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this Code section, additional benefits payable (1) in the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means; (2) in the event of total and permanent disability; (3) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits; (4) as term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this Code section would not apply; (5) as term insurance on the life of a child, or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if the term insurance expires before the child attains age 26, is uniform in amount after the child attains age one and has not become paid up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; or (6) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this Code section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.(h)(1)This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this Code section, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986, except that, with respect to such policies for which the gross premium during the first policy year includes any additional amounts for which no comparable additional benefit is provided during that year, this subsection shall apply to any such policies issued after a specified operative date before January 1, 1986, as defined in subsection (e) of this Code section. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two tenths of 1 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of (A) the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified and (B) the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy.(2)The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value on such anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary; provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection (b) or (d) of this Code section, whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection (b) or (d) of this Code section, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.(3)The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection (d) or (e) of this Code section, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by paragraph (4) of this subsection, such percentage:(A)Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (i) the fifth policy anniversary and (ii) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two tenths of 1 percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and(B)Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years.(4)Provided, that no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection (d) or (e) of this Code section, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.(5)All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections of this Code section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.(6)Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), and (g) of this Code section. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed as items (1) through (6) in subsection (g) of this Code section shall conform with the principles of this subsection.(i)This Code section shall not apply to any of the following:(1)Reinsurance;(2)Group insurance;(3)Pure endowment;(4)Annuity or reversionary annuity contract;(5)Term policy of uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;(6)Term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in subsections (d) and (e) of this Code section, is less than the adjusted premium so calculated on a term policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy; or(7)Policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Code section, exceeds 2 1/2 percent of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year.For purposes of determining the applicability of this Code section, the age at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the oldest life.Amended by 2018 Ga.
