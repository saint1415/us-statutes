and(E)For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply;However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of 1 percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 (using the reference interest rate defined for 1979) and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when subsection (e) of Code Section33-25-4becomes operative.(3)The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated above are given in the following tables:(A)Weighting Factors for Life Insurance:Guarantee DurationYearsWeightingFactors10 or less.50More than 10, but not more than 20.45More than 20.35For life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values or both which are guaranteed in the original policy;(B)Weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: .80; and(C)Weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, shall be as specified in Tables I, II, and III of this subparagraph, according to the rules and definitions in IV, V, and VI of this subparagraph:I.For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis:Guarantee DurationWeighting Factor for Plan Type(Years)ABC5 or less:.80.60.50More than 5, but not more than 10:.75.60.50More than 10, but not more than 20:.65.50.45More than 20:.45.35.35II.For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors shown in Table I increased by:Plan TypeABC.15.25.05III.For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis (other than those with no cash settlement options) which do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis which do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than 12 months beyond the valuation date, the factors shown in Table I or derived in Table II increased by:Plan TypeABC.15.25.05IV.For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence;V.Plan type as used in the above tables is defined as follows:Plan Type A: At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only (1) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer, or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or (3) as an immediate life annuity, or (4) no withdrawal permitted;Plan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only (1) with adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer, or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or (3) no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years;Plan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either (1) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer, or (2) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund;VI.An insurer may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this subsection, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.(4)The reference interest rate referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be defined as follows:(A)For all life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published in Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;(B)For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;(C)For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, with guarantee duration in excess of ten years, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;(D)For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, with guarantee duration of ten years or less, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;(E)For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; and(F)For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.(5)In the event that Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or, in the event that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then the alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner, may be substituted.(g)(1)Except as otherwise provided in subsections (l) and (n) of this Code section, reserves according to the Commissioner's reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, shall be the excess, if any, of the present value at the date of valuation of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policies over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for the policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy, that the present value at the date of issue of the policy of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph over subparagraph (B) of this paragraph as follows:(A)A net level annual premium equal to the present value at the date of issue of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value at the date of issue of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due; provided, however, that the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the 19 year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of the policy; and(B)A net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year.Provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after the effective date of subsection (h) of Code Section33-25-4for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the Commissioner's reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined in this subsection as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this Code section, be the greater of the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph and the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with (i) the value defined in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph being reduced by 15 percent of the amount of such excess first year premium, (ii) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (iii) the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment, and (iv) the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison, the mortality and interest bases stated in subsections (e) and (f) of this Code section shall be used.(2)Reserves according to the Commissioner's reserve valuation method for:(A)Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums;(B)Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section408of the Internal Revenue Code as now or hereafter amended;(C)Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and(D)All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of this subsection.(h)This subsection shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section408of the Internal Revenue Code. Reserves according to the Commissioner's annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in the contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values at the date of valuation of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits provided for by the contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value at the date of valuation of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations required by the terms of the contract that become payable prior to the end of the respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of the contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.(i)In no event shall an insurer's aggregate reserve for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits issued on or after January 1, 1966, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subsections (g), (h), (l), and (m) of this Code section and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for the policies. In no event shall the aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts, and benefits be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (d) of this Code section.(j)(1)Reserves for all policies and contracts issued prior to January 1, 1966, may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to that date.(2)For any category of policies, contracts, or benefits specified in subsection (e) of this Code section issued on or after January 1, 1966, reserves may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standard or standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this Code section; but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be higher than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for in the policies and contracts.(k)An insurer that at any time had adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided for in subsection (i) of this Code section may, with the approval of the Commissioner, adopt any lower standard of valuation but not lower than the minimum provided in this subsection; provided, however, that for the purposes of this subsection, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (d) of this Code section shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.(l)If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurer on any policy or contract issued on or after January 1, 1966, is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for such policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for such policy or contract or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this Code section are those standards stated in subsections (e) and (f) of this Code section. Provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after the effective date of subsection (h) of Code Section33-25-4for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides as an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in subsection (g) of this Code section, ignoring the second paragraph of paragraph (1) of subsection (g) of this Code section. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection (g) of this Code section, including the second paragraph of paragraph (1) of subsection (g) of this Code section, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.(m)In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity which is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (e), (g), (h), and (l) of this Code section, the reserves which are held under any such plan must:(1)Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; and(2)Be computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this Code section, the \"Standard Valuation Law,\" as determined by regulations promulgated by the Commissioner.(n)For accident and health insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section. For disability, accident and sickness, accident, and health insurance contracts issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the minimum standard of valuation is the standard adopted by the Commissioner by regulation.(o)(1)For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section, except as provided under paragraphs (5) and (7) of this subsection.(2)The operative date of the valuation manual is January 1 of the first calendar year following the first July 1 as of which all of the following have occurred:(A)The valuation manual has been adopted by the NAIC by an affirmative vote of at least 42 members, or three-fourths of the members voting, whichever is greater;(B)The Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the NAIC in 2009, or legislation including substantially similar terms and provisions, has been enacted by states representing greater than 75 percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the following annual statements submitted for 2008: life, accident, and health annual statements; health annual statements; or fraternal annual statements; and(C)The Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the NAIC in 2009, or legislation including substantially similar terms and provisions, has been enacted by at least 42 of the following 55 jurisdictions: the 50 states of the United States, American Samoa, the American Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.(3)Unless a change in the valuation manual specifies a later effective date, changes to the valuation manual shall be effective on January 1 following the date when the change to the valuation manual has been adopted by the NAIC by an affirmative vote representing:(A)At least three-fourths of the members of the NAIC voting, but not less than a majority of the total membership; and(B)Members of the NAIC representing jurisdictions totaling greater than 75 percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the following annual statements most recently available prior to the vote in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph: life, accident, and health annual statements, health annual statements, or fraternal annual statements.(4)The valuation manual must specify all of the following:(A)Minimum valuation standards for and definitions of the policies or contracts subject to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section. Such minimum valuation standards shall be:(i)The Commissioner's reserve valuation method for life insurance contracts, other than annuity contracts, subject to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section;(ii)The Commissioner's annuity reserve valuation method for annuity contracts subject to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section; and(iii)Minimum reserves for all other policies or contracts subject to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section;(B)Which policies or contracts or types of policies or contracts that are subject to the requirements of a principle-based valuation in paragraph (1) of subsection (p) of this Code section and the minimum valuation standards consistent with those requirements;(C)For policies and contracts subject to a principle-based valuation under subsection (p) of this Code section:(i)Requirements for the format of reports to the Commissioner under subparagraph (p)(2)(C) of this Code section and which shall include information necessary to determine if the valuation is appropriate and in compliance with this Code section;(ii)Assumptions shall be prescribed for risks over which the company does not have significant control or influence; and(iii)Procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial function, and a process for appropriate waiver or modification of such procedures;(D)For policies not subject to a principle-based valuation under subsection (p) of this Code section, the minimum valuation standard shall either:(i)Be consistent with the minimum standard of valuation prior to the operative date of the valuation manual; or(ii)Develop reserves that quantify the benefits and guarantees, and the funding, associated with the contracts and their risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring;(E)Other requirements, including, but not limited to, those relating to reserve methods, models for measuring risk, generation of economic scenarios, assumptions, margins, use of company experience, risk measurement, disclosure, certifications, reports, actuarial opinions and memorandums, transition rules, and internal controls; and(F)The data and form of the data required under subsection (q) of this Code section, with whom the data must be submitted, and may specify other requirements including data analyses and reporting of analyses.(5)In the absence of a specific valuation requirement or if a specific valuation requirement in the valuation manual is not, in the opinion of the Commissioner, in compliance with this Code section, then the company shall, with respect to such requirements, comply with minimum valuation standards prescribed by the Commissioner by regulation.(6)The Commissioner may engage a qualified actuary, at the expense of the company, to perform an actuarial examination of the company and opine on the appropriateness of any reserve assumption or method used by the company, or to review and opine on a company's compliance with any requirement set forth in this Code section.

For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 (using the reference interest rate defined for 1979) and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when subsection (e) of Code Section33-25-4becomes operative.(3)The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated above are given in the following tables:(A)Weighting Factors for Life Insurance:Guarantee DurationYearsWeightingFactors10 or less.50More than 10, but not more than 20.45More than 20.35For life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values or both which are guaranteed in the original policy;(B)Weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: .80; and(C)Weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, shall be as specified in Tables I, II, and III of this subparagraph, according to the rules and definitions in IV, V, and VI of this subparagraph:I.For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis:Guarantee DurationWeighting Factor for Plan Type(Years)ABC5 or less:.80.60.50More than 5, but not more than 10:.75.60.50More than 10, but not more than 20:.65.50.45More than 20:.45.35.35II.For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors shown in Table I increased by:Plan TypeABC.15.25.05III.For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis (other than those with no cash settlement options) which do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis which do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than 12 months beyond the valuation date, the factors shown in Table I or derived in Table II increased by:Plan TypeABC.15.25.05IV.For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of 20 years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence;V.Plan type as used in the above tables is defined as follows:Plan Type A: At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only (1) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer, or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or (3) as an immediate life annuity, or (4) no withdrawal permitted;Plan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only (1) with adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer, or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or (3) no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years;Plan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five years either (1) without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurer, or (2) subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund;VI.An insurer may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this subsection, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.(4)The reference interest rate referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be defined as follows:(A)For all life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published in Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;(B)For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;(C)For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, with guarantee duration in excess of ten years, the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months and the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;(D)For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, with guarantee duration of ten years or less, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;(E)For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; and(F)For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.(5)In the event that Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or, in the event that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average - Monthly Average Corporates as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then the alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner, may be substituted.(g)(1)Except as otherwise provided in subsections (l) and (n) of this Code section, reserves according to the Commissioner's reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, shall be the excess, if any, of the present value at the date of valuation of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policies over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for the policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy, that the present value at the date of issue of the policy of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph over subparagraph (B) of this paragraph as follows:(A)A net level annual premium equal to the present value at the date of issue of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value at the date of issue of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due; provided, however, that the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the 19 year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of the policy; and(B)A net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year.Provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after the effective date of subsection (h) of Code Section33-25-4for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the Commissioner's reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined in this subsection as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this Code section, be the greater of the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph and the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with (i) the value defined in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph being reduced by 15 percent of the amount of such excess first year premium, (ii) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (iii) the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment, and (iv) the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison, the mortality and interest bases stated in subsections (e) and (f) of this Code section shall be used.(2)Reserves according to the Commissioner's reserve valuation method for:(A)Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums;(B)Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section408of the Internal Revenue Code as now or hereafter amended;(C)Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and(D)All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of this subsection.(h)This subsection shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section408of the Internal Revenue Code. Reserves according to the Commissioner's annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in the contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values at the date of valuation of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits provided for by the contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value at the date of valuation of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations required by the terms of the contract that become payable prior to the end of the respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of the contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.(i)In no event shall an insurer's aggregate reserve for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits issued on or after January 1, 1966, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subsections (g), (h), (l), and (m) of this Code section and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for the policies. In no event shall the aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts, and benefits be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (d) of this Code section.(j)(1)Reserves for all policies and contracts issued prior to January 1, 1966, may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to that date.(2)For any category of policies, contracts, or benefits specified in subsection (e) of this Code section issued on or after January 1, 1966, reserves may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standard or standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this Code section; but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be higher than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for in the policies and contracts.(k)An insurer that at any time had adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided for in subsection (i) of this Code section may, with the approval of the Commissioner, adopt any lower standard of valuation but not lower than the minimum provided in this subsection; provided, however, that for the purposes of this subsection, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (d) of this Code section shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.(l)If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurer on any policy or contract issued on or after January 1, 1966, is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for such policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for such policy or contract or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this Code section are those standards stated in subsections (e) and (f) of this Code section. Provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after the effective date of subsection (h) of Code Section33-25-4for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides as an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in subsection (g) of this Code section, ignoring the second paragraph of paragraph (1) of subsection (g) of this Code section. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection (g) of this Code section, including the second paragraph of paragraph (1) of subsection (g) of this Code section, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.(m)In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity which is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (e), (g), (h), and (l) of this Code section, the reserves which are held under any such plan must:(1)Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; and(2)Be computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this Code section, the \"Standard Valuation Law,\" as determined by regulations promulgated by the Commissioner.(n)For accident and health insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section. For disability, accident and sickness, accident, and health insurance contracts issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the minimum standard of valuation is the standard adopted by the Commissioner by regulation.(o)(1)For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section, except as provided under paragraphs (5) and (7) of this subsection.(2)The operative date of the valuation manual is January 1 of the first calendar year following the first July 1 as of which all of the following have occurred:(A)The valuation manual has been adopted by the NAIC by an affirmative vote of at least 42 members, or three-fourths of the members voting, whichever is greater;(B)The Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the NAIC in 2009, or legislation including substantially similar terms and provisions, has been enacted by states representing greater than 75 percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the following annual statements submitted for 2008: life, accident, and health annual statements; health annual statements; or fraternal annual statements; and(C)The Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the NAIC in 2009, or legislation including substantially similar terms and provisions, has been enacted by at least 42 of the following 55 jurisdictions: the 50 states of the United States, American Samoa, the American Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.(3)Unless a change in the valuation manual specifies a later effective date, changes to the valuation manual shall be effective on January 1 following the date when the change to the valuation manual has been adopted by the NAIC by an affirmative vote representing:(A)At least three-fourths of the members of the NAIC voting, but not less than a majority of the total membership; and(B)Members of the NAIC representing jurisdictions totaling greater than 75 percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the following annual statements most recently available prior to the vote in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph: life, accident, and health annual statements, health annual statements, or fraternal annual statements.(4)The valuation manual must specify all of the following:(A)Minimum valuation standards for and definitions of the policies or contracts subject to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section. Such minimum valuation standards shall be:(i)The Commissioner's reserve valuation method for life insurance contracts, other than annuity contracts, subject to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section;(ii)The Commissioner's annuity reserve valuation method for annuity contracts subject to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section; and(iii)Minimum reserves for all other policies or contracts subject to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section;(B)Which policies or contracts or types of policies or contracts that are subject to the requirements of a principle-based valuation in paragraph (1) of subsection (p) of this Code section and the minimum valuation standards consistent with those requirements;(C)For policies and contracts subject to a principle-based valuation under subsection (p) of this Code section:(i)Requirements for the format of reports to the Commissioner under subparagraph (p)(2)(C) of this Code section and which shall include information necessary to determine if the valuation is appropriate and in compliance with this Code section;(ii)Assumptions shall be prescribed for risks over which the company does not have significant control or influence; and(iii)Procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial function, and a process for appropriate waiver or modification of such procedures;(D)For policies not subject to a principle-based valuation under subsection (p) of this Code section, the minimum valuation standard shall either:(i)Be consistent with the minimum standard of valuation prior to the operative date of the valuation manual; or(ii)Develop reserves that quantify the benefits and guarantees, and the funding, associated with the contracts and their risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring;(E)Other requirements, including, but not limited to, those relating to reserve methods, models for measuring risk, generation of economic scenarios, assumptions, margins, use of company experience, risk measurement, disclosure, certifications, reports, actuarial opinions and memorandums, transition rules, and internal controls; and(F)The data and form of the data required under subsection (q) of this Code section, with whom the data must be submitted, and may specify other requirements including data analyses and reporting of analyses.(5)In the absence of a specific valuation requirement or if a specific valuation requirement in the valuation manual is not, in the opinion of the Commissioner, in compliance with this Code section, then the company shall, with respect to such requirements, comply with minimum valuation standards prescribed by the Commissioner by regulation.(6)The Commissioner may engage a qualified actuary, at the expense of the company, to perform an actuarial examination of the company and opine on the appropriateness of any reserve assumption or method used by the company, or to review and opine on a company's compliance with any requirement set forth in this Code section. The Commissioner may rely upon the opinion, regarding provisions contained within this Code section, of a qualified actuary engaged by the commissioner of another state, district, or territory of the United States. As used in this paragraph, the term \"engage\" includes employment and contracting.(7)The Commissioner may require a company to change any assumption or method that in the opinion of the Commissioner is necessary in order to comply with the requirements of the valuation manual or this Code section; and the company shall adjust the reserves as required by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may take other disciplinary action as permitted pursuant to this title.(p)(1)A company must establish reserves using a principle-based valuation that meets the following conditions for policies or contracts as specified in the valuation manual:(A)Quantify the benefits and guarantees, and the funding, associated with the contracts and their risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring during the lifetime of the contracts, and for policies or contracts with significant tail risk, reflects conditions appropriately adverse to quantify the tail risk;(B)Incorporate assumptions, risk analysis methods and financial models, and management techniques that are consistent with, but not necessarily identical to, those utilized within the company's overall risk assessment process, while recognizing potential differences in financial reporting structures and any prescribed assumptions or methods;(C)Incorporate assumptions that are derived in one of the following manners:(i)The assumption is prescribed in the valuation manual; or(ii)For assumptions that are not prescribed, the assumptions shall:(I)Be established utilizing the company's available experience, to the extent it is relevant and statistically credible; or(II)To the extent that company data is not available, relevant, or statistically credible, be established utilizing other relevant, statistically credible experience; and(D)Provide margins for uncertainty, including adverse deviation and estimation error, such that the greater the uncertainty the larger the margin and resulting reserve.(2)A company using a principle-based valuation for one or more policies or contracts subject to this subsection as specified in the valuation manual shall:(A)Establish procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial valuation function consistent with those described in the valuation manual;(B)Provide to the Commissioner and the board of directors an annual certification of the effectiveness of the internal controls with respect to the principle-based valuation.

The modified net premiums for the policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy, that the present value at the date of issue of the policy of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph over subparagraph (B) of this paragraph as follows:(A)A net level annual premium equal to the present value at the date of issue of such benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value at the date of issue of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due; provided, however, that the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the 19 year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of the policy; and(B)A net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year.Provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after the effective date of subsection (h) of Code Section33-25-4for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the Commissioner's reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined in this subsection as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l) of this Code section, be the greater of the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph and the reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with (i) the value defined in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph being reduced by 15 percent of the amount of such excess first year premium, (ii) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (iii) the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment, and (iv) the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison, the mortality and interest bases stated in subsections (e) and (f) of this Code section shall be used.(2)Reserves according to the Commissioner's reserve valuation method for:(A)Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums;(B)Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section408of the Internal Revenue Code as now or hereafter amended;(C)Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and(D)All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of this subsection.(h)This subsection shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section408of the Internal Revenue Code. Reserves according to the Commissioner's annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in the contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values at the date of valuation of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits provided for by the contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value at the date of valuation of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations required by the terms of the contract that become payable prior to the end of the respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate or rates, specified in such contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of the contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.(i)In no event shall an insurer's aggregate reserve for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits issued on or after January 1, 1966, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subsections (g), (h), (l), and (m) of this Code section and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for the policies. In no event shall the aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts, and benefits be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (d) of this Code section.(j)(1)Reserves for all policies and contracts issued prior to January 1, 1966, may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to that date.(2)For any category of policies, contracts, or benefits specified in subsection (e) of this Code section issued on or after January 1, 1966, reserves may be calculated, at the option of the insurer, according to any standard or standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this Code section; but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be higher than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for in the policies and contracts.(k)An insurer that at any time had adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided for in subsection (i) of this Code section may, with the approval of the Commissioner, adopt any lower standard of valuation but not lower than the minimum provided in this subsection; provided, however, that for the purposes of this subsection, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection (d) of this Code section shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.(l)If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurer on any policy or contract issued on or after January 1, 1966, is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for such policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for such policy or contract or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this Code section are those standards stated in subsections (e) and (f) of this Code section. Provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after the effective date of subsection (h) of Code Section33-25-4for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides as an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in subsection (g) of this Code section, ignoring the second paragraph of paragraph (1) of subsection (g) of this Code section. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection (g) of this Code section, including the second paragraph of paragraph (1) of subsection (g) of this Code section, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.(m)In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity which is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (e), (g), (h), and (l) of this Code section, the reserves which are held under any such plan must:(1)Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; and(2)Be computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this Code section, the \"Standard Valuation Law,\" as determined by regulations promulgated by the Commissioner.(n)For accident and health insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section. For disability, accident and sickness, accident, and health insurance contracts issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the minimum standard of valuation is the standard adopted by the Commissioner by regulation.(o)(1)For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section, except as provided under paragraphs (5) and (7) of this subsection.(2)The operative date of the valuation manual is January 1 of the first calendar year following the first July 1 as of which all of the following have occurred:(A)The valuation manual has been adopted by the NAIC by an affirmative vote of at least 42 members, or three-fourths of the members voting, whichever is greater;(B)The Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the NAIC in 2009, or legislation including substantially similar terms and provisions, has been enacted by states representing greater than 75 percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the following annual statements submitted for 2008: life, accident, and health annual statements; health annual statements; or fraternal annual statements; and(C)The Standard Valuation Law, as amended by the NAIC in 2009, or legislation including substantially similar terms and provisions, has been enacted by at least 42 of the following 55 jurisdictions: the 50 states of the United States, American Samoa, the American Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.(3)Unless a change in the valuation manual specifies a later effective date, changes to the valuation manual shall be effective on January 1 following the date when the change to the valuation manual has been adopted by the NAIC by an affirmative vote representing:(A)At least three-fourths of the members of the NAIC voting, but not less than a majority of the total membership; and(B)Members of the NAIC representing jurisdictions totaling greater than 75 percent of the direct premiums written as reported in the following annual statements most recently available prior to the vote in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph: life, accident, and health annual statements, health annual statements, or fraternal annual statements.(4)The valuation manual must specify all of the following:(A)Minimum valuation standards for and definitions of the policies or contracts subject to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Code section.

The Commissioner may rely upon the opinion, regarding provisions contained within this Code section, of a qualified actuary engaged by the commissioner of another state, district, or territory of the United States.
