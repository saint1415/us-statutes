The insured's uninsured motorist coverage shall not be used to duplicate payments made under any available bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance coverages but instead shall be available as additional insurance coverage in excess of any available bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance coverages; provided, however, that the insured's combined recovery from the insured's uninsured motorist coverages and the available coverages under the bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance on such uninsured motor vehicle shall not exceed the sum of all economic and noneconomic losses sustained by the insured. For purposes of this subdivision, available coverages under the bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance coverages on such motor vehicle shall be the limits of coverage less any amounts by which the maximum amounts payable under such limits of coverage have, by reason of payment of other claims or otherwise, been reduced below the limits of coverage;(II)Provided, however, that an insured may reject the coverage referenced in subdivision (I) of this division and select in writing coverage for the occurrence of sustaining losses from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle that considers such motor vehicle to be uninsured only for the amount of the difference between the available coverages under the bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance coverages on such motor vehicle and the limits of the uninsured motorist coverages provided under the insured's motor vehicle insurance policies; and, for purposes of this subdivision, available coverages under the bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance coverages on such motor vehicle shall be the limits of coverage less any amounts by which the maximum amounts payable under such limits of coverage have, by reason of payment of other claims or otherwise, been reduced below the limits of coverage; and(III)Neither coverage under subdivision (I) nor (II) of this division shall be applicable if the insured rejects such coverages as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this Code section. The coverage set forth in subdivision (I) of this division need not be provided in or supplemental to a renewal policy where the named insured has rejected the coverage set forth in subdivision (I) of this division and selected the coverage set forth in subdivision (II) of this division in connection with a policy previously issued to said insured by the same insurer;(iii)Bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance in existence but the insurance company writing the insurance has legally denied coverage under its policy;(iv)Bodily injury liability and property damage liability insurance in existence but the insurance company writing the insurance is unable, because of being insolvent, to make either full or partial payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured, provided that in the event that a partial payment is made by or on behalf of the insolvent insurer with respect to the legal liability of its insured, then the motor vehicle shall only be considered to be uninsured for the amount of the difference between the partial payment and the limits of the uninsured motorist coverage provided under the insured's motor vehicle insurance policy; or(v)No bond or deposit of cash or securities in lieu of bodily injury and property damage liability insurance.(2)A motor vehicle shall be deemed to be uninsured if the owner or operator of the motor vehicle is unknown. In those cases, recovery under the endorsement or provisions shall be subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (c) through (j) of this Code section, and, in order for the insured to recover under the endorsement where the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured is unknown, actual physical contact shall have occurred between the motor vehicle owned or operated by the unknown person and the person or property of the insured. Such physical contact shall not be required if the description by the claimant of how the occurrence occurred is corroborated by an eyewitness to the occurrence other than the claimant.(c)If the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured is unknown, the insured, or someone on his behalf, or in the event of a death claim someone on behalf of the party having the claim, in order for the insured to recover under the endorsement, shall report the accident as required by Code Section40-6-273.(d)In cases where the owner or operator of any vehicle causing injury or damages is known, and either or both are named as defendants in any action for such injury or damages, and a reasonable belief exists that the vehicle is an uninsured motor vehicle under subparagraph (b)(1)(D) of this Code section, a copy of the action and all pleadings thereto shall be served as prescribed by law upon the insurance company issuing the policy as though the insurance company were actually named as a party defendant. If facts arise after an action has been commenced which create a reasonable belief that a vehicle is an uninsured motor vehicle under subparagraph (b)(1)(D) of this Code section and no such reasonable belief existed prior to the commencement of the action against the defendant, and the complaint was timely served on the defendant, the insurance company issuing the policy shall be served within either the remainder of the time allowed for valid service on the defendant or 90 days after the date on which the party seeking relief discovered, or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered, that the vehicle was uninsured or underinsured, whichever period is greater. The uninsured motorist carrier may conduct discovery as a matter of right for a period of not less than 120 days after service prior to any hearing on the merits of the action. If either the owner or operator of any vehicle causing injury or damages is unknown, an action may be instituted against the unknown defendant as \"John Doe,\" and a copy of the action and all pleadings thereto shall be served as prescribed by law upon the insurance company issuing the policy as though the insurance company were actually named as a party defendant; and the insurance company shall have the right to file pleadings and take other action allowable by law in the name of \"John Doe\" or itself. In any case arising under this Code section where service upon an insurance company is prescribed, the clerk of the court in which the action is brought shall have such service accomplished by issuing a duplicate original copy for the sheriff or marshal to place his or her return of service in the same form and manner as prescribed by law for a party defendant. The return of service upon the insurance company shall in no case appear upon the original pleadings in such case. In the case of a known owner or operator of such vehicle, either or both of whom are named as a defendant in such action, the insurance company issuing the policy shall have the right to file pleadings and take other action allowable by law in the name of either the known owner or operator or both or itself.(1)In cases where the owner or operator of a vehicle causing injury or damages is unknown and an action is instituted against the unknown defendant as \"John Doe,\" the residence of such \"John Doe\" defendant shall be presumed to be in the county in which the accident causing injury or damages occurred, or in the county of residence of the plaintiff, at the election of the plaintiff in the action.(2)A motor vehicle shall not be deemed to be an uninsured motor vehicle within the meaning of this Code section when the owner or operator of such motor vehicle has deposited security, pursuant to Code Section40-9-32, in the amounts specified in subparagraph (a)(1)(A) of this Code section.(e)In cases where the owner or operator of any vehicle causing injury or damage is known and either or both are named as defendants in any action for such injury or damages but the person resides out of the state, has departed from the state, cannot after due diligence be found within the state, or conceals himself to avoid the service of summons, and this fact shall appear by affidavit to the satisfaction of the judge of the court, and it shall appear either by affidavit or by a verified complaint on file that a claim exists against the owner or driver in respect to whom service is to be made and that he is a necessary or proper party to the action, the judge may grant an order that the service be made on the owner or driver by the publication of summons. A copy of any action filed and all pleadings thereto shall be served as prescribed by law upon the insurance company issuing the policy as though the insurance company issuing the policy were actually named as a party defendant. Subsection (d) of this Code section shall govern the rights of the insurance company, the duties of the clerk of court concerning duplicate original copies of the pleadings, and the return of service. Following service on the owner or driver by the publication of the summons as provided in this subsection and service as prescribed by law upon the insurance company issuing the policy, the plaintiff shall have a continuing duty to exercise diligence in attempting to locate the owner or driver against whom the claim exists, but such obligation of diligence shall not extend beyond a period of 12 months following service upon the owner or driver by publication of the summons. However, regardless of such time limitations, should the plaintiff learn of the location of the owner or driver against whom the claim exists, the plaintiff shall exercise due diligence to effect service of process upon that owner or driver within a reasonable time period after receiving such information.(f)An insurer paying a claim under the endorsement or provisions required by subsection (a) of this Code section shall be subrogated to the rights of the insured to whom the claim was paid against the person causing such injury, death, or damage to the extent that payment was made, including the proceeds recoverable from the assets of the insolvent insurer, provided that the bringing of an action against the unknown owner or operator as \"John Doe\" or the conclusion of such an action shall not constitute a bar to the insured, if the identity of the owner or operator who caused the injury or damages complained of becomes known, bringing an action against the owner or operator theretofore proceeded against as \"John Doe\"; provided, further, that any recovery against such owner or operator shall be paid to the insurance company to the extent that the insurance company paid the named insured in the action brought against the owner or operator as \"John Doe,\" except that the insurance company shall pay its proportionate part of any reasonable costs and expense incurred in connection therewith, including reasonable attorney's fees. Nothing in an endorsement or provisions made under this Code section nor any other provision of law shall operate to prevent the joining in an action against \"John Doe\" or the owner or operator of the motor vehicle causing such injury as a party defendant, and joinder is specifically authorized.(g)No endorsement or provisions shall contain a provision requiring arbitration of any claim arising under any endorsement or provisions, nor may anything be required of the insured, subject to the other provisions of the policy or contract, except the establishment of legal liability; nor shall the insured be restricted or prevented, in any manner, from employing legal counsel or instituting legal proceedings.(h)Before a motor vehicle shall be deemed to be uninsured because of the insolvency of an insurance company under division (b)(1)(D)(iv) of this Code section, an insurer under the uninsured motorists endorsement provisions of subsection (a) of this Code section must be given notice within a reasonable time by its insured of the pendency of any legal proceeding against such insurance company of which he may have knowledge, and before the insured enters into any negotiation or arrangement with the insurance company, and before the insurer is prejudiced by any action or nonaction of the insured with respect to the determinations of the insolvency of the insurance company.(i)In addition to any offsets or reductions contained in the provisions of division (b)(1)(D)(ii) of this Code section, an endorsement or the provisions of the policy providing the coverage required by this Code section may contain provisions which exclude any liability of the insurer for injury to or destruction of property of the insured for which such insured has been compensated by other property or physical damage insurance and may contain provisions which exclude any liability of the insurer for personal or bodily injury or death for which the insured has been compensated pursuant to \"medical payments coverage,\" as such term is defined in paragraph (1) of Code Section33-34-2, or compensated pursuant to workers' compensation laws.(j)If the insurer shall refuse to pay any insured any loss covered by this Code section within 60 days after a demand has been made by the insured and a finding has been made that such refusal was made in bad faith, the insurer shall be liable to the insured in addition to any recovery under this Code section for not more than 25 percent of the recovery or $25,000.00, whichever is greater, and all reasonable attorney's fees for the prosecution of the case under this Code section. The question of bad faith, the amount of the penalty, if any, and the reasonable attorney's fees, if any, shall be determined in a separate action filed by the insured against the insurer after a judgment has been rendered against the uninsured motorist in the original tort action. The attorney's fees shall be fixed on the basis of competent expert evidence as to the reasonable value of the services, based on the time spent and legal and factual issues involved, in accordance with prevailing fees in the locality where the action is pending. The trial court shall have the discretion, if it finds such jury verdict fixing attorney's fees to be greatly excessive or inadequate, to review and amend such portion of the verdict fixing attorney's fees without the necessity of disapproving the entire verdict. The limitations contained in this subsection in reference to the amount of attorney's fees are not controlling as to the fees which may be agreed upon by the plaintiff and his or her attorney for the services of the attorney in the action against the insurer.Amended by 2022 Ga.

Such physical contact shall not be required if the description by the claimant of how the occurrence occurred is corroborated by an eyewitness to the occurrence other than the claimant.(c)If the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured is unknown, the insured, or someone on his behalf, or in the event of a death claim someone on behalf of the party having the claim, in order for the insured to recover under the endorsement, shall report the accident as required by Code Section40-6-273.(d)In cases where the owner or operator of any vehicle causing injury or damages is known, and either or both are named as defendants in any action for such injury or damages, and a reasonable belief exists that the vehicle is an uninsured motor vehicle under subparagraph (b)(1)(D) of this Code section, a copy of the action and all pleadings thereto shall be served as prescribed by law upon the insurance company issuing the policy as though the insurance company were actually named as a party defendant. If facts arise after an action has been commenced which create a reasonable belief that a vehicle is an uninsured motor vehicle under subparagraph (b)(1)(D) of this Code section and no such reasonable belief existed prior to the commencement of the action against the defendant, and the complaint was timely served on the defendant, the insurance company issuing the policy shall be served within either the remainder of the time allowed for valid service on the defendant or 90 days after the date on which the party seeking relief discovered, or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered, that the vehicle was uninsured or underinsured, whichever period is greater. The uninsured motorist carrier may conduct discovery as a matter of right for a period of not less than 120 days after service prior to any hearing on the merits of the action. If either the owner or operator of any vehicle causing injury or damages is unknown, an action may be instituted against the unknown defendant as \"John Doe,\" and a copy of the action and all pleadings thereto shall be served as prescribed by law upon the insurance company issuing the policy as though the insurance company were actually named as a party defendant; and the insurance company shall have the right to file pleadings and take other action allowable by law in the name of \"John Doe\" or itself. In any case arising under this Code section where service upon an insurance company is prescribed, the clerk of the court in which the action is brought shall have such service accomplished by issuing a duplicate original copy for the sheriff or marshal to place his or her return of service in the same form and manner as prescribed by law for a party defendant. The return of service upon the insurance company shall in no case appear upon the original pleadings in such case. In the case of a known owner or operator of such vehicle, either or both of whom are named as a defendant in such action, the insurance company issuing the policy shall have the right to file pleadings and take other action allowable by law in the name of either the known owner or operator or both or itself.(1)In cases where the owner or operator of a vehicle causing injury or damages is unknown and an action is instituted against the unknown defendant as \"John Doe,\" the residence of such \"John Doe\" defendant shall be presumed to be in the county in which the accident causing injury or damages occurred, or in the county of residence of the plaintiff, at the election of the plaintiff in the action.(2)A motor vehicle shall not be deemed to be an uninsured motor vehicle within the meaning of this Code section when the owner or operator of such motor vehicle has deposited security, pursuant to Code Section40-9-32, in the amounts specified in subparagraph (a)(1)(A) of this Code section.(e)In cases where the owner or operator of any vehicle causing injury or damage is known and either or both are named as defendants in any action for such injury or damages but the person resides out of the state, has departed from the state, cannot after due diligence be found within the state, or conceals himself to avoid the service of summons, and this fact shall appear by affidavit to the satisfaction of the judge of the court, and it shall appear either by affidavit or by a verified complaint on file that a claim exists against the owner or driver in respect to whom service is to be made and that he is a necessary or proper party to the action, the judge may grant an order that the service be made on the owner or driver by the publication of summons. A copy of any action filed and all pleadings thereto shall be served as prescribed by law upon the insurance company issuing the policy as though the insurance company issuing the policy were actually named as a party defendant. Subsection (d) of this Code section shall govern the rights of the insurance company, the duties of the clerk of court concerning duplicate original copies of the pleadings, and the return of service. Following service on the owner or driver by the publication of the summons as provided in this subsection and service as prescribed by law upon the insurance company issuing the policy, the plaintiff shall have a continuing duty to exercise diligence in attempting to locate the owner or driver against whom the claim exists, but such obligation of diligence shall not extend beyond a period of 12 months following service upon the owner or driver by publication of the summons. However, regardless of such time limitations, should the plaintiff learn of the location of the owner or driver against whom the claim exists, the plaintiff shall exercise due diligence to effect service of process upon that owner or driver within a reasonable time period after receiving such information.(f)An insurer paying a claim under the endorsement or provisions required by subsection (a) of this Code section shall be subrogated to the rights of the insured to whom the claim was paid against the person causing such injury, death, or damage to the extent that payment was made, including the proceeds recoverable from the assets of the insolvent insurer, provided that the bringing of an action against the unknown owner or operator as \"John Doe\" or the conclusion of such an action shall not constitute a bar to the insured, if the identity of the owner or operator who caused the injury or damages complained of becomes known, bringing an action against the owner or operator theretofore proceeded against as \"John Doe\"; provided, further, that any recovery against such owner or operator shall be paid to the insurance company to the extent that the insurance company paid the named insured in the action brought against the owner or operator as \"John Doe,\" except that the insurance company shall pay its proportionate part of any reasonable costs and expense incurred in connection therewith, including reasonable attorney's fees. Nothing in an endorsement or provisions made under this Code section nor any other provision of law shall operate to prevent the joining in an action against \"John Doe\" or the owner or operator of the motor vehicle causing such injury as a party defendant, and joinder is specifically authorized.(g)No endorsement or provisions shall contain a provision requiring arbitration of any claim arising under any endorsement or provisions, nor may anything be required of the insured, subject to the other provisions of the policy or contract, except the establishment of legal liability; nor shall the insured be restricted or prevented, in any manner, from employing legal counsel or instituting legal proceedings.(h)Before a motor vehicle shall be deemed to be uninsured because of the insolvency of an insurance company under division (b)(1)(D)(iv) of this Code section, an insurer under the uninsured motorists endorsement provisions of subsection (a) of this Code section must be given notice within a reasonable time by its insured of the pendency of any legal proceeding against such insurance company of which he may have knowledge, and before the insured enters into any negotiation or arrangement with the insurance company, and before the insurer is prejudiced by any action or nonaction of the insured with respect to the determinations of the insolvency of the insurance company.(i)In addition to any offsets or reductions contained in the provisions of division (b)(1)(D)(ii) of this Code section, an endorsement or the provisions of the policy providing the coverage required by this Code section may contain provisions which exclude any liability of the insurer for injury to or destruction of property of the insured for which such insured has been compensated by other property or physical damage insurance and may contain provisions which exclude any liability of the insurer for personal or bodily injury or death for which the insured has been compensated pursuant to \"medical payments coverage,\" as such term is defined in paragraph (1) of Code Section33-34-2, or compensated pursuant to workers' compensation laws.(j)If the insurer shall refuse to pay any insured any loss covered by this Code section within 60 days after a demand has been made by the insured and a finding has been made that such refusal was made in bad faith, the insurer shall be liable to the insured in addition to any recovery under this Code section for not more than 25 percent of the recovery or $25,000.00, whichever is greater, and all reasonable attorney's fees for the prosecution of the case under this Code section. The question of bad faith, the amount of the penalty, if any, and the reasonable attorney's fees, if any, shall be determined in a separate action filed by the insured against the insurer after a judgment has been rendered against the uninsured motorist in the original tort action. The attorney's fees shall be fixed on the basis of competent expert evidence as to the reasonable value of the services, based on the time spent and legal and factual issues involved, in accordance with prevailing fees in the locality where the action is pending. The trial court shall have the discretion, if it finds such jury verdict fixing attorney's fees to be greatly excessive or inadequate, to review and amend such portion of the verdict fixing attorney's fees without the necessity of disapproving the entire verdict. The limitations contained in this subsection in reference to the amount of attorney's fees are not controlling as to the fees which may be agreed upon by the plaintiff and his or her attorney for the services of the attorney in the action against the insurer.Amended by 2022 Ga.

      "text": "(a)Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a deduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) of this subsection, and the Commissioner may adopt by regulation pursuant to subsection (d) of this Code section specific additional requirements relating to or setting forth the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in subsection (d) of this Code section, and the circumstances in which credit will be reduced or eliminated. Credit shall be allowed under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection only with respect to cessions of those kinds of classes of business for which the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. If meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection, the requirements of paragraph (8) of this subsection shall also be met:(1)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state;(2)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is accredited as a reinsurer by the Commissioner in this state. In order to be eligible for accreditation, a reinsurer shall:(A)File with the Commissioner evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction;(B)Submit to this state's authority to examine its books and records;(C)Be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, be entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state;(D)File annually with the Commissioner a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and(E)Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount of not less than $20 million and its accreditation has not been denied by the Commissioner within 90 days after the submission of its application;(3)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is domiciled and licensed in, or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through a state which employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this Code section and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer:(A)Maintains a surplus with regard to policyholders in an amount not less than $20 million; and(B)Submits to the authority of this state to examine its books and records. Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system;(4)(A)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in subsection (c) of this Code section, for the payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. The assuming insurer shall report annually to the Commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Annual Statement form by licensed insurers to enable the Commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than $20 million; provided, however, that, at any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by trust for at least three full years, the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction of the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based upon an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including, when applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than 30 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust. In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, the group shall maintain a trusteed surplus of which $100 million shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account; the incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of solvency regulation and control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and, within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the Commissioner an annual certification of the solvency of each underwriter by the group's domiciliary regulator or, if a certification is unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants of each member of the group.(B)In the case of a group of incorporated insurers under common administration which complies with the filing requirements contained in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and which has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately prior to making application for accreditation, and submits to this state's authority to examine its books and records and bears the expense of the examination, and which has aggregate policyholders' surplus of $10 billion; the trust shall be in an amount equal to the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by the United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of such group; plus the group shall maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100 million shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for any such liabilities, and within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, each member of the group shall make available to the Commissioner an annual certification of the member's solvency by the member's domiciliary regulator and financial statements prepared by its independent public accountant.(C)Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted under this paragraph unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by the commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled or the commissioner of another state, who, pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust. The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in the trustees of the trust for its United States ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the Commissioner. The trust must remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer shall have outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.(D)No later than February 28 of each year the trustees of the trust shall report to the Commissioner in writing setting forth the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments as of the end of the preceding year and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust shall not expire prior to the next following December 31;(5)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection if such assuming insurer has been certified by the Commissioner as a reinsurer in this state and secures its obligations in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.(A)In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall meet the following requirements:(i)The assuming insurer shall be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the Commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph;(ii)The assuming insurer shall maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the Commissioner pursuant to regulation;(iii)The assuming insurer shall maintain financial strength ratings from two or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the Commissioner pursuant to regulation;(iv)The assuming insurer shall agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this state, appoint the Commissioner as its agent for service of process in this state, and agree to provide security for 100 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment;(v)The assuming insurer shall agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the Commissioner, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis; and(vi)The assuming insurer shall satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the Commissioner.(B)An association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters may be a certified reinsurer. In order to be eligible for certification, in addition to satisfying requirements of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph:(i)The association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association of any of its members, in an amount determined by the Commissioner to provide adequate protection;(ii)The incorporated members of the association shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and(iii)Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the Commissioner an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.(C)The Commissioner shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the Commissioner as a certified reinsurer.(i)In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-United States assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the Commissioner shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-United States jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. A qualified jurisdiction shall agree to share information and cooperate with the Commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the Commissioner has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards. Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the Commissioner.(ii)A list of qualified jurisdictions shall be published through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Committee Process. The Commissioner shall consider this list in determining qualified jurisdictions. If the Commissioner approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the Commissioner shall provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulations.(iii)United States jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program shall be recognized as qualified jurisdictions.(iv)If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the Commissioner has the discretion to suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.(D)The Commissioner shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the Commissioner pursuant to regulation. The Commissioner shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.(E)A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States ceding insurers under this subparagraph at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in regulations promulgated by the Commissioner.(i)In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the Commissioner and consistent with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Code section, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subsection, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph.(ii)If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to paragraph (4) of this subsection, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this subsection or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to paragraph (4) of this subsection. It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this paragraph that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account.(iii)The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this subsection, except that such trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10 million.(iv)With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this subparagraph, if the security is insufficient, the Commissioner shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and shall have the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.(v)For purposes of this subparagraph, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure 100 percent of its obligations:(I)As used in this subparagraph, the term \"terminated\" refers to revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status.(II)If the Commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this paragraph, this requirement shall not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.(F)If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an NAIC accredited jurisdiction, the Commissioner shall have the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction's certification, and shall have the discretion to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and such assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.(G)A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this paragraph, and the Commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business;(6)(A)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer meeting each of the conditions set forth below:(i)The assuming insurer must have its head office or be domiciled in, as applicable, and be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction.

Sections 313and314, that is currently in effect or in a period of provisional application and that addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this state or for allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance;(II)A United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program; or(III)A qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the Commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, which is not otherwise described in subdivision (I) or (II) of this division and which meets certain additional requirements, consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements, as specified by the Commissioner in regulation;(ii)The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be set forth in regulation. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to be set forth in regulation;(iii)The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, which shall be set forth in regulation.

Such security shall be in a form consistent with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this subsection and subsection (b) of this Code section and as specified by the Commissioner in regulation;(v)The assuming insurer or its legal successor must provide, if requested by the Commissioner, on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors, certain documentation to the Commissioner, as specified by the Commissioner in regulation;(vi)The assuming insurer must maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria set forth in regulation; and(vii)The assuming insurer's supervisory authority must confirm to the Commissioner on an annual basis, as of the preceding December 31 or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements set forth in divisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph.Nothing in this paragraph precludes an assuming insurer from providing the Commissioner with information on a voluntary basis.(B)(i)The Commissioner shall timely create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions.(ii)A list of reciprocal jurisdictions is published through the NAIC Committee Process. The Commissioner's list shall include any reciprocal jurisdiction as defined in subdivision (A)(i)(I) or (A)(i)(II) of this paragraph and shall consider any other reciprocal jurisdiction included on the NAIC list. The Commissioner may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the NAIC list of reciprocal jurisdictions in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulations issued by the Commissioner.(iii)The Commissioner may remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction, in accordance with a process set forth in regulation issued by the Commissioner, except that the Commissioner shall not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction as defined in subdivision (A)(i)(I) or (A)(i)(II) of this paragraph. Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from the list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer which has its home office or is domiciled in such jurisdiction shall be allowed, if otherwise allowed pursuant to this Code section.(C)The Commissioner shall timely create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions set forth in this paragraph and to which cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with this paragraph. The Commissioner may add an assuming insurer to such list if an NAIC accredited jurisdiction has added such assuming insurer to a list of such assuming insurers or if, upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits information to the Commissioner as required under division (iv) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and complies with any additional requirements that the Commissioner may impose by regulation, except to the extent that they conflict with an applicable covered agreement.(D)(i)If the Commissioner determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements under this paragraph, the Commissioner may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the assuming insurer for recognition under this paragraph in accordance with procedures set forth in regulation.(ii)While an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, no reinsurance agreement issued, amended, or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subsection (b) of this Code section.(iii)If an assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into prior to the date of revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the Commissioner and consistent with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Code section.(E)If subject to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation, as applicable, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming insurer post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.(F)Nothing in this paragraph shall limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in such reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by this Code section or other applicable law or regulation.(G)Credit may be taken under this paragraph only for reinsurance agreements entered into, amended, or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, and only with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported on or after the later of the date on which the assuming insurer has met all eligibility requirements pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or the effective date of the new reinsurance agreement, amendment, or renewal; provided, however, that:(i)This subparagraph shall not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this paragraph, so long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision of this Code section;(ii)Nothing in this paragraph shall authorize an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement except as permitted by the terms of the agreement; and(iii)Nothing in this paragraph shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate the agreement.(H)This paragraph does not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this paragraph, as long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision of this Code section.(I)Nothing in this paragraph shall authorize an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement except as permitted by the terms of the agreement.(J)Nothing in this paragraph shall limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate the agreement.(7)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) of this subsection, but only as to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions where the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction;(8)If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited, or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the credit permitted by paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements:(A)That, in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, shall comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction, and shall abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and(B)To designate the Commissioner or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit, or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding insurer.This paragraph is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if this obligation is created in the agreement;(9)If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (6) of this subsection, the credit permitted by paragraph (4) or (5) of this subsection shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:(A)Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because it contains an amount less than the amount required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) of this subsection, as applicable, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation, or similar proceedings under the laws of its state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the commissioner with regulatory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund;(B)The assets shall be distributed by and claims shall be filed with and valued by the commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies;(C)If the commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part thereof are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets or part thereof shall be returned by the commissioner with regulatory oversight to the trustee for distribution in accordance with the trust agreement;

The suspension or revocation shall not take effect until after the Commissioner's order on hearing, unless:(i)The reinsurer waives its right to hearing;(ii)The Commissioner's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer under subparagraph (F) of paragraph (5) of this subsection; or(iii)The Commissioner finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the Commissioner's action.(B)While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subsection (b) of this Code section.

Laws 408, § 2.\n\n(a)Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a deduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) of this subsection, and the Commissioner may adopt by regulation pursuant to subsection (d) of this Code section specific additional requirements relating to or setting forth the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in subsection (d) of this Code section, and the circumstances in which credit will be reduced or eliminated. Credit shall be allowed under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection only with respect to cessions of those kinds of classes of business for which the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. If meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection, the requirements of paragraph (8) of this subsection shall also be met:(1)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state;(2)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is accredited as a reinsurer by the Commissioner in this state. In order to be eligible for accreditation, a reinsurer shall:(A)File with the Commissioner evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction;(B)Submit to this state's authority to examine its books and records;(C)Be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, be entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state;(D)File annually with the Commissioner a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and(E)Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount of not less than $20 million and its accreditation has not been denied by the Commissioner within 90 days after the submission of its application;(3)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is domiciled and licensed in, or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through a state which employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this Code section and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer:(A)Maintains a surplus with regard to policyholders in an amount not less than $20 million; and(B)Submits to the authority of this state to examine its books and records. Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system;(4)(A)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in subsection (c) of this Code section, for the payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. The assuming insurer shall report annually to the Commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Annual Statement form by licensed insurers to enable the Commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than $20 million; provided, however, that, at any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by trust for at least three full years, the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction of the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based upon an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including, when applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than 30 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust. In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, the group shall maintain a trusteed surplus of which $100 million shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account; the incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of solvency regulation and control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and, within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the Commissioner an annual certification of the solvency of each underwriter by the group's domiciliary regulator or, if a certification is unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants of each member of the group.(B)In the case of a group of incorporated insurers under common administration which complies with the filing requirements contained in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and which has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately prior to making application for accreditation, and submits to this state's authority to examine its books and records and bears the expense of the examination, and which has aggregate policyholders' surplus of $10 billion; the trust shall be in an amount equal to the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by the United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of such group; plus the group shall maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100 million shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for any such liabilities, and within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, each member of the group shall make available to the Commissioner an annual certification of the member's solvency by the member's domiciliary regulator and financial statements prepared by its independent public accountant.(C)Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted under this paragraph unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by the commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled or the commissioner of another state, who, pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust. The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in the trustees of the trust for its United States ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the Commissioner. The trust must remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer shall have outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust.(D)No later than February 28 of each year the trustees of the trust shall report to the Commissioner in writing setting forth the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments as of the end of the preceding year and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust shall not expire prior to the next following December 31;(5)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection if such assuming insurer has been certified by the Commissioner as a reinsurer in this state and secures its obligations in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.(A)In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall meet the following requirements:(i)The assuming insurer shall be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the Commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph;(ii)The assuming insurer shall maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the Commissioner pursuant to regulation;(iii)The assuming insurer shall maintain financial strength ratings from two or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the Commissioner pursuant to regulation;(iv)The assuming insurer shall agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this state, appoint the Commissioner as its agent for service of process in this state, and agree to provide security for 100 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment;(v)The assuming insurer shall agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the Commissioner, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis; and(vi)The assuming insurer shall satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the Commissioner.(B)An association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters may be a certified reinsurer. In order to be eligible for certification, in addition to satisfying requirements of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph:(i)The association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association of any of its members, in an amount determined by the Commissioner to provide adequate protection;(ii)The incorporated members of the association shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and(iii)Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the Commissioner an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.(C)The Commissioner shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the Commissioner as a certified reinsurer.(i)In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-United States assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the Commissioner shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-United States jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. A qualified jurisdiction shall agree to share information and cooperate with the Commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the Commissioner has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards. Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the Commissioner.(ii)A list of qualified jurisdictions shall be published through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Committee Process.

It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this paragraph that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account.(iii)The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this subsection, except that such trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10 million.(iv)With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this subparagraph, if the security is insufficient, the Commissioner shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and shall have the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.(v)For purposes of this subparagraph, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure 100 percent of its obligations:(I)As used in this subparagraph, the term \"terminated\" refers to revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status.(II)If the Commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this paragraph, this requirement shall not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.(F)If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an NAIC accredited jurisdiction, the Commissioner shall have the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction's certification, and shall have the discretion to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and such assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.(G)A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this paragraph, and the Commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business;(6)(A)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer meeting each of the conditions set forth below:(i)The assuming insurer must have its head office or be domiciled in, as applicable, and be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction.

Laws 408, § 2.\n\n(a)Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a deduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) of this subsection, and the Commissioner may adopt by regulation pursuant to subsection (d) of this Code section specific additional requirements relating to or setting forth the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in subsection (d) of this Code section, and the circumstances in which credit will be reduced or eliminated. Credit shall be allowed under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection only with respect to cessions of those kinds of classes of business for which the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. If meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection, the requirements of paragraph (8) of this subsection shall also be met:(1)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state;(2)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is accredited as a reinsurer by the Commissioner in this state. In order to be eligible for accreditation, a reinsurer shall:(A)File with the Commissioner evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction;(B)Submit to this state's authority to examine its books and records;(C)Be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, be entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state;(D)File annually with the Commissioner a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and(E)Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount of not less than $20 million and its accreditation has not been denied by the Commissioner within 90 days after the submission of its application;(3)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is domiciled and licensed in, or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through a state which employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this Code section and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer:(A)Maintains a surplus with regard to policyholders in an amount not less than $20 million; and(B)Submits to the authority of this state to examine its books and records. Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system;(4)(A)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in subsection (c) of this Code section, for the payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. The assuming insurer shall report annually to the Commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Annual Statement form by licensed insurers to enable the Commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than $20 million; provided, however, that, at any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by trust for at least three full years, the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction of the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based upon an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including, when applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than 30 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust. In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, the group shall maintain a trusteed surplus of which $100 million shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account; the incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of solvency regulation and control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and, within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the Commissioner an annual certification of the solvency of each underwriter by the group's domiciliary regulator or, if a certification is unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants of each member of the group.(B)In the case of a group of incorporated insurers under common administration which complies with the filing requirements contained in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and which has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately prior to making application for accreditation, and submits to this state's authority to examine its books and records and bears the expense of the examination, and which has aggregate policyholders' surplus of $10 billion; the trust shall be in an amount equal to the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by the United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of such group; plus the group shall maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100 million shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for any such liabilities, and within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, each member of the group shall make available to the Commissioner an annual certification of the member's solvency by the member's domiciliary regulator and financial statements prepared by its independent public accountant.(C)Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted under this paragraph unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by the commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled or the commissioner of another state, who, pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust. The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in the trustees of the trust for its United States ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the Commissioner.

A qualified jurisdiction shall agree to share information and cooperate with the Commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction.

Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the Commissioner.(ii)A list of qualified jurisdictions shall be published through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Committee Process. The Commissioner shall consider this list in determining qualified jurisdictions.

It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this paragraph that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account.(iii)The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this subsection, except that such trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10 million.(iv)With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this subparagraph, if the security is insufficient, the Commissioner shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and shall have the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.(v)For purposes of this subparagraph, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure 100 percent of its obligations:(I)As used in this subparagraph, the term \"terminated\" refers to revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status.(II)If the Commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this paragraph, this requirement shall not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.(F)If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an NAIC accredited jurisdiction, the Commissioner shall have the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction's certification, and shall have the discretion to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and such assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.(G)A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this paragraph, and the Commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business;(6)(A)Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer meeting each of the conditions set forth below:(i)The assuming insurer must have its head office or be domiciled in, as applicable, and be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction.

Such security shall be in a form consistent with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this subsection and subsection (b) of this Code section and as specified by the Commissioner in regulation;(v)The assuming insurer or its legal successor must provide, if requested by the Commissioner, on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors, certain documentation to the Commissioner, as specified by the Commissioner in regulation;(vi)The assuming insurer must maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria set forth in regulation; and(vii)The assuming insurer's supervisory authority must confirm to the Commissioner on an annual basis, as of the preceding December 31 or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements set forth in divisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph.Nothing in this paragraph precludes an assuming insurer from providing the Commissioner with information on a voluntary basis.(B)(i)The Commissioner shall timely create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions.(ii)A list of reciprocal jurisdictions is published through the NAIC Committee Process.
