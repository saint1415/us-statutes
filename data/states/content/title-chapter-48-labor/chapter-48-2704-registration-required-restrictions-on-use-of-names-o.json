An applicant may apply for an extension with the department, but any such request shall be accompanied by a letter from the auditor stating the reasons for the delay and the anticipated audit completion date.The financial statement shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and audited by an independent certified public accountant licensed to practice in the jurisdiction in which such accountant is located and shall be without qualification as to the going concern status of the professional employer organization. A professional employer organization group may submit combined or consolidated financial statements to meet the requirements of this section. A professional employer organization that has not had sufficient operating history to have audited financial statements based upon at least twelve months of operating history shall meet the financial responsibility requirements of section 48-2705 and present financial statements reviewed by a certified public accountant.(4)(a) Each professional employer organization operating within this state as of January 1, 2012, shall complete its initial registration not later than one hundred eighty days after January 1, 2012. Such initial registration shall be valid until one hundred eighty days from the end of the professional employer organization's first fiscal year that is more than one year after January 1, 2012.(b) Each professional employer organization not operating within this state as of January 1, 2012, shall complete its initial registration prior to initiating operations within this state. If a professional employer organization not registered in this state becomes aware that an existing client not based in this state has employees and operations in this state, the professional employer organization shall either decline to provide professional employer services for those employees or notify the department within five business days of its knowledge of this fact and file a limited registration application under subsection (7) of this section or a full registration if there are more than fifty covered employees. The department may issue an interim operating permit for the period the registration application is pending if the professional employer organization is currently registered or licensed by another state and the department determines it to be in the best interests of the potential covered employees.(5) Within one hundred eighty days after the end of a registrant's fiscal year, such registrant shall renew its registration by notifying the department of any changes in the information provided in such registrant's most recent registration or renewal.

Such rule and regulation may provide for the acceptance of electronic filings and other assurance by an independent and qualified entity approved by the department that provides satisfactory assurance of compliance acceptable to the department consistent with or in lieu of the requirements of this section and section 48-2705. Such rule and regulation shall permit a professional employer organization to authorize the entity approved by the department to act on the professional employer organization's behalf in complying with the registration requirements of the act, including electronic filings of information and payment of registration fees. Use of such an approved entity shall be optional and not mandatory for a registrant. Nothing in this subsection shall limit or change the department's authority to register or terminate registration of a professional employer organization or to investigate or enforce any provision of the act.(11) All records, reports, and other information obtained from a professional employer organization under the act, except to the extent necessary for the proper administration of the act by the department, shall be confidential and shall not be published or open to public inspection other than to public employees in the performance of their public duties.SourceLaws 2010, LB579, § 4.",
