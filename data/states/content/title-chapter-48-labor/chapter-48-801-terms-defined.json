Department of Public Institutions, 195 Neb. 253, 237 N.W.2d 841 (1976).To pass scrutiny of Constitution of the United States, Nebraska Court of Industrial Relations, in case within its jurisdiction, must be deemed to have sufficient power to fully vindicate, preserve, and protect a federal constitutional right. Teamsters Pub. Emp. U. Loc. 594 v. City of West Point, 338 F.Supp. 927 (D. Neb. 1972).2. Jurisdiction of commissionA mere request by a union for information regarding employee transfer lists and test results which is declined by the employer does not constitute an industrial dispute. Neb. Pub. Emp. v. City of Omaha, 235 Neb. 768, 457 N.W.2d 429 (1990).A uniquely personal termination of employment does not constitute an industrial dispute, notwithstanding the fact it may involve a controversy concerning terms, tenure, or conditions of employment. Wood v. Tesch, 222 Neb. 654, 386 N.W.2d 436 (1986).The Commission of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction, that is, authorized power, to resolve industrial disputes between agencies or departments of the State of Nebraska and their employees.

MiscellaneousEmployees lose the statutory protection of the Industrial Relations Act for conduct or speech if it is flagrant misconduct, which includes, but is not limited to, statements or actions that (1) are of an outrageous and insubordinate nature, (2) compromise the public employer's ability to accomplish its mission, or (3) disrupt discipline, as well as conduct that is clearly outside the bounds of any protection such as assault and battery or racial discrimination. Omaha Police Union Local 101 v. City of Omaha, 274 Neb. 70, 736 N.W.2d 375 (2007).Public employees belonging to a labor organization have the protected right to engage in conduct and make remarks, including publishing statements through the media, concerning wages, hours, or terms and conditions of employment. Omaha Police Union Local 101 v. City of Omaha, 274 Neb. 70, 736 N.W.2d 375 (2007).The Commission of Industrial Relations must balance the employee's right to engage in protected activity, which permits some leeway for impulsive behavior, against the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff. Factors that the commission may consider, but would not necessarily be determinative, include: (1) the place and subject matter of the conduct or speech, (2) whether the employee's conduct or speech was impulsive or designed, (3) whether the conduct or speech was provoked by the employer's conduct, and (4) the nature of the intemperate language or conduct. Omaha Police Union Local 101 v. City of Omaha, 274 Neb. 70, 736 N.W.2d 375 (2007).The Industrial Relations Act is not only an attempt to level the employment playing field, but is also a mechanism designed to protect the citizens of Nebraska from the effects and consequences of labor strife in public sector employment.

City of Omaha, 274 Neb. 70, 736 N.W.2d 375 (2007).Teachers in Class III, IV, and VI school districts are subject to provisions of Teachers' Professional Negotiation Act. Lincoln Ed. Assn. v.
