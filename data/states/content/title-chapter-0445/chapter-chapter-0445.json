Each local board shall, at a minimum, provide quarterly reports on the following measures:(a)The percent of participants working in unsubsidized employment.(b)The percent of participants who stop receiving benefits for reasons other than disqualification or sanction.(c)The number of sanctions and waivers that are granted, measured by the type of sanction or waiver and the number of completed compliance activities that lead to a restoration of benefits.(d)The median placement wage rate.(e)The TANF work participation rate, defined as the participation requirements specified under Pub. L. No. 109-171, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.(f)A self-sufficiency index, by county, calculated each quarter based on the percent of current or former participants who stop receiving benefits or are working 30 or more hours per week and at 1 and 2 years after participants stop receiving benefits or work 30 or more hours per week. The quarterly report must include the percentage of participants earning at or above 200 percent of the federal poverty level 3 years after participants stop receiving benefits or work 30 or more hours per week. The quarterly report must also contain an expected range of performance for each county on the self-sufficiency index. The expected range shall be derived by a statistical methodology developed in consultation with the local boards. The statistical methodology shall control differences across counties in economic conditions and demographics of participants in family self-sufficiency programs under chapter 414 and welfare transition programs under this chapter.(2)The state board and the department shall share information with and develop protocols for information exchange with the Florida Education and Training Placement Information Program.(3)The state board and the department may initiate or participate in additional evaluation or assessment activities that will further the systematic study of issues related to program goals and outcomes.(4)In providing for evaluation activities, the state board and the department shall safeguard the use or disclosure of information obtained from program participants consistent with federal or state requirements. Evaluation methodologies may be used which are appropriate for evaluation of program activities, including random assignment of recipients or participants into program groups or control groups. To the extent necessary or appropriate, evaluation data shall provide information with respect to the state, district, or county, or other substate area.(5)The state board and the department may contract with a qualified organization for evaluations conducted under this section.History.—s. 26, ch. 96-175; s. 20, ch. 97-173; s. 68, ch. 97-237; s. 27, ch. 99-241; s. 32, ch. 2000-165; s. 51, ch. 2004-350; s. 262, ch. 2014-19; s. 43, ch. 2015-98; s. 26, ch. 2020-30; s. 11, ch. 2021-164.Note.—Former s. 414.23.",
