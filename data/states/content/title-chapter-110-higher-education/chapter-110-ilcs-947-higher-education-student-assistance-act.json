The number of qualified persons who desire a higher education is\nincreasing rapidly, and the physical facilities, faculties, and staffs of\nthe institutions of higher learning operated by, within and for the\nresidents of the State will have to be\nexpanded greatly to accommodate those persons, with an attendant sharp\nincrease in the cost of educating them. A system of financial\nassistance of scholarships, grants, and loans for qualified\nresidents of college age will enable them to attend qualified institutions\nof their choice in the State, public or private. The adoption of new federal\nstudent loan legislation necessitates that the State update and broaden its\nsystem of financial student assistance.",
