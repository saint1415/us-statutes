      "text": "Adequate health care in this State is contingent\nupon a large pool of nurses and physicians from which to choose.\nResearch has shown that there is an identifiable shortage of nurses\nand physicians in this State. Nurses are recognized as\nexperienced caregivers, familiar with many of the same procedures and\npractices that are carried out by physicians. Many nurses who\ndisplay an aptitude or desire to further advance their career in the\nprofession of nursing or into the field of medicine\nby becoming physicians are unable to do so because of inadequate\nfinancial resources. It is therefore public policy\nof the State of Illinois to encourage the establishment of\nprivate organizations, foundations, groups, partnerships, corporations or\ncommittees organized to provide assistance through grants or loans to\nnurses and to work with educational institutions to further these goals\nin order to encourage people in the nursing field to advance into nursing\nspecialties or to pursue advancement in the nursing profession or careers\nin medicine by making financial assistance available to them.",
