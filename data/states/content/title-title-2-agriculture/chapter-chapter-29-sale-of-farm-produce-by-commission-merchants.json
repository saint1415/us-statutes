Said bond is intended and shall be so conditioned as to secure the faithful account for and payment to the consignor of the proceeds of all farm products handled or sold by such commission merchants. Every such bond shall cover every transaction (within its scope) occurring at any time after its filing and until 60 days after any new bond shall be filed. If at any time the commissioner is of the opinion that the responsibility of any surety or sureties on any existing bond is or is in danger of becoming impaired for any reason, he shall require the giving of a new bond with good and sufficient surety or sureties. Subject to the foregoing provision, upon issue of a new permit to a commission merchant theretofore licensed, no new bond shall be required, but the old bond theretofore given shall continue in force, unless the sureties on such old bond notify the commissioner in writing before October 1 in any year of dissent from such continuance. In the latter event, a new bond shall be required. Civil actions upon the appropriate bond or bonds may be brought (but only within one year after accrual) directly by the consignor, his representatives or assigns in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover for any loss or damage resulting from any breach or breaches of conditions of such bond or bonds.\n\n(Ag.
